Find the value of a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function f(x) = a x³ - 3x + 1 is always greater than or equal to zero for x in the interval [-1, 1]. I need to find the value of a. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that if a function is always non-negative on an interval, it means that its minimum value on that interval is zero or positive. So, I need to find the minimum of f(x) on [-1, 1] and ensure that it's at least zero. To find the minimum, I should look for critical points where the derivative is zero or undefined, and also check the endpoints of the interval.Let me compute the derivative of f(x). The derivative f'(x) is 3a x² - 3. Setting this equal to zero to find critical points:3a x² - 3 = 0  => a x² - 1 = 0  => x² = 1/a  => x = ±√(1/a)Wait, but this is only valid if a ≠ 0. Since the original function is a cubic, a can't be zero because otherwise, the function would be linear, and it wouldn't necessarily be non-negative on the entire interval. So, a must be non-zero.Now, the critical points are at x = √(1/a) and x = -√(1/a). But these points must lie within the interval [-1, 1] for them to be considered. So, √(1/a) must be less than or equal to 1. That means 1/a ≤ 1, so a ≥ 1. Similarly, since √(1/a) is positive, the negative critical point is just the negative of that, so it will automatically be within [-1, 1] if the positive one is.Wait, hold on. If a is positive, then √(1/a) is real, but if a is negative, then √(1/a) would involve imaginary numbers, which aren't in our interval. So, does that mean a must be positive? Because if a is negative, the critical points would be complex, so the function would have no critical points in the real numbers, meaning the extrema would only occur at the endpoints.Hmm, so maybe I need to consider two cases: a positive and a negative. But since the function is a cubic, if a is negative, as x approaches positive infinity, f(x) would go to negative infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, it would go to positive infinity. But our interval is only from -1 to 1, so maybe even if a is negative, the function could still be non-negative on that interval? I'm not sure, but let's see.But let's first assume that a is positive. Then, the critical points are at x = ±√(1/a). Since we're looking at x in [-1, 1], √(1/a) must be less than or equal to 1, so 1/a ≤ 1, which implies a ≥ 1. So, if a is greater than or equal to 1, the critical points are within the interval; otherwise, they're outside.So, if a ≥ 1, the critical points are inside the interval, so we need to evaluate f(x) at x = -1, x = 1, and at x = ±√(1/a). If a < 1, then the critical points are outside the interval, so the extrema would only be at the endpoints x = -1 and x = 1.But since the problem states that f(x) is always non-negative on [-1, 1], regardless of where the critical points are, we need to make sure that the function is non-negative at all points in the interval, including the critical points if they lie within the interval.So, let's first consider the case when a ≥ 1. Then, we have critical points at x = √(1/a) and x = -√(1/a). Let's compute f at these points.First, let's compute f(√(1/a)):f(√(1/a)) = a*(√(1/a))³ - 3*(√(1/a)) + 1  = a*(1/a)^(3/2) - 3*(1/√a) + 1  = a*(1/(a^(3/2))) - 3/(√a) + 1  = (a)/(a^(3/2)) - 3/(√a) + 1  = 1/√a - 3/√a + 1  = (-2)/√a + 1Similarly, f(-√(1/a)):f(-√(1/a)) = a*(-√(1/a))³ - 3*(-√(1/a)) + 1  = a*(-1/a)^(3/2) - 3*(-1/√a) + 1  Wait, hold on, let me compute this step by step.First, (-√(1/a))³ is equal to - (√(1/a))³, which is - (1/a)^(3/2). So,f(-√(1/a)) = a*(- (1/a)^(3/2)) - 3*(-√(1/a)) + 1  = -a*(1/a)^(3/2) + 3*(1/√a) + 1  = - (a)/(a^(3/2)) + 3/√a + 1  = -1/√a + 3/√a + 1  = (2)/√a + 1So, f(-√(1/a)) is 2/√a + 1, which is always positive because a is positive, so 2/√a is positive, and adding 1 keeps it positive. So, that point is fine.But f(√(1/a)) is (-2)/√a + 1. For f(x) to be non-negative at that point, we need:(-2)/√a + 1 ≥ 0  => 1 ≥ 2/√a  => √a ≥ 2  => a ≥ 4So, if a is greater than or equal to 4, then f(√(1/a)) is non-negative. But if a is between 1 and 4, then f(√(1/a)) would be negative, which violates the condition that f(x) is always non-negative on [-1,1]. Therefore, a must be at least 4.But wait, let's not jump to conclusions yet. We also need to check the endpoints x = -1 and x = 1.Compute f(1):f(1) = a*(1)^3 - 3*(1) + 1 = a - 3 + 1 = a - 2Similarly, f(-1):f(-1) = a*(-1)^3 - 3*(-1) + 1 = -a + 3 + 1 = -a + 4So, for f(1) to be non-negative:a - 2 ≥ 0  => a ≥ 2And for f(-1) to be non-negative:-a + 4 ≥ 0  => a ≤ 4So, combining these two, a must be between 2 and 4. But earlier, we found that if a is between 1 and 4, then f(√(1/a)) is negative. So, that seems conflicting.Wait, so if a is between 2 and 4, then f(1) is non-negative, f(-1) is non-negative, but f(√(1/a)) is negative because a is less than 4, so (-2)/√a + 1 is negative. Therefore, the function would dip below zero somewhere in the interval, which is not allowed.So, to make sure that f(√(1/a)) is non-negative, a must be at least 4. But then, if a is 4, let's check f(1):f(1) = 4 - 2 = 2 ≥ 0, which is fine.f(-1) = -4 + 4 = 0, which is also fine.And f(√(1/4)) = f(1/2):f(1/2) = 4*(1/2)^3 - 3*(1/2) + 1  = 4*(1/8) - 3/2 + 1  = 0.5 - 1.5 + 1  = 0So, at x = 1/2, f(x) is zero, which is acceptable because the function is allowed to be zero.Similarly, f(-1/2):f(-1/2) = 4*(-1/2)^3 - 3*(-1/2) + 1  = 4*(-1/8) + 3/2 + 1  = -0.5 + 1.5 + 1  = 2Which is positive.So, when a = 4, the function touches zero at x = 1/2 and x = -1, and is positive elsewhere on the interval. So, that seems to satisfy the condition.But wait, earlier when I considered a ≥ 1, but then realized that a must be ≥4 to satisfy the critical point. But if a is greater than 4, say a = 5, let's check f(√(1/5)):f(√(1/5)) = (-2)/√5 + 1 ≈ (-2)/2.236 + 1 ≈ -0.894 + 1 ≈ 0.106, which is positive.But also, f(1) = 5 - 2 = 3, which is positive, and f(-1) = -5 + 4 = -1, which is negative. Wait, that can't be. If a = 5, then f(-1) = -5 + 4 = -1, which is negative, violating the condition.Wait, so if a is greater than 4, f(-1) becomes negative, which is not allowed. So, a cannot be greater than 4. Therefore, a must be exactly 4.Wait, let me verify that. If a = 4, f(-1) = -4 + 4 = 0, which is okay. If a is greater than 4, f(-1) becomes negative, which is not allowed. If a is less than 4, then either f(1) is negative (if a < 2) or f(√(1/a)) is negative (if 2 ≤ a <4). So, the only value of a that satisfies all conditions is a =4.Wait, but let me check a = 2. If a =2, then f(1) = 2 - 2 =0, which is okay, and f(-1)= -2 +4=2, which is positive. But f(√(1/2)):f(√(1/2)) = (-2)/√2 +1 ≈ (-2)/1.414 +1 ≈ -1.414 +1 ≈ -0.414, which is negative. So, at a=2, the function is negative somewhere in the interval, which is not allowed.Therefore, a must be at least 4 to make sure that the minimum at x=√(1/a) is non-negative, and also, a must be at most 4 to ensure that f(-1) is non-negative. Thus, a=4 is the only value that satisfies both conditions.But just to be thorough, let me check a=4:f(x)=4x³ -3x +1Compute f(1)=4 -3 +1=2 ≥0f(-1)= -4 +3 +1=0 ≥0f(1/2)=4*(1/8) -3*(1/2)+1=0.5 -1.5 +1=0 ≥0f(-1/2)=4*(-1/8) -3*(-1/2)+1= -0.5 +1.5 +1=2 ≥0Also, let's check another point, say x=0:f(0)=0 -0 +1=1 ≥0And maybe x=1/4:f(1/4)=4*(1/64) -3*(1/4)+1= (1/16) - (3/4) +1≈0.0625 -0.75 +1≈0.3125 ≥0And x= -1/4:f(-1/4)=4*(-1/64) -3*(-1/4)+1= (-1/16) + (3/4) +1≈-0.0625 +0.75 +1≈1.6875 ≥0So, all these points are non-negative, which is good.Wait, but let me check the critical point x=√(1/4)=1/2, which we already did, and it's zero. So, that's the minimum point.Therefore, a=4 is the correct value.But just to make sure, let me consider a slightly different approach. Maybe using the fact that f(x) must be non-negative on [-1,1], so the minimum of f(x) on that interval is zero.So, perhaps, the function touches zero at some point in the interval, and is positive elsewhere. So, maybe the minimum occurs at x=1/2, as we saw earlier.Alternatively, maybe I can set up the equation f(x)=0 and find a such that this equation has a double root in [-1,1], meaning that the function touches the x-axis there.Wait, if f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0 at the same point, that would be a double root. So, let's suppose that there exists a point c in [-1,1] such that f(c)=0 and f'(c)=0.So, let's set up the system:1. a c³ - 3c +1 =0  2. 3a c² -3=0From the second equation, 3a c² -3=0 => a c²=1 => a=1/c²Substitute a=1/c² into the first equation:(1/c²) c³ -3c +1=0  => c -3c +1=0  => -2c +1=0  => c=1/2So, c=1/2 is the point where both f(c)=0 and f'(c)=0. Therefore, a=1/( (1/2)^2 )=1/(1/4)=4So, this confirms that a=4 is the value where the function has a double root at x=1/2, making it the minimum point, and ensuring that the function is non-negative on the entire interval.Therefore, the value of a is 4.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"A and B bought the same number of sheets of stationery.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, especially when different bases are involved. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step.First, I remember that logarithms with different bases can sometimes be converted to a common base to make the equation easier to handle. Maybe I can express all the logarithms in terms of natural logarithms or base 10. Alternatively, I might use the change of base formula, which is (log_b a = frac{ln a}{ln b}). That could help me rewrite all the terms with the same base, which might simplify things.Looking at the equation, I see that there are logarithms with base 2 and base 3. Maybe I can express both in terms of natural logarithms. Let me try that.So, let's denote (a = log_{2} x) and (b = log_{3} x). Then, the left side of the equation becomes (a cdot b). On the right side, we have (log_{3}(x^3)) and (log_{2}(x^2)). Using logarithm properties, I can bring the exponents in front. So, (log_{3}(x^3) = 3 log_{3} x = 3b) and (log_{2}(x^2) = 2 log_{2} x = 2a). Therefore, the right side becomes (3b + 2a - 6).So, substituting back into the equation, we have:[a cdot b = 3b + 2a - 6]Hmm, that looks a bit simpler. Now, let's rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:[a cdot b - 3b - 2a + 6 = 0]Looking at this, maybe I can factor it. Let me see if grouping terms helps. Let's group the terms with (a) and the terms with (b):[ab - 2a - 3b + 6 = 0]Factor (a) from the first two terms and (b) from the next two:[a(b - 2) - 3(b - 2) = 0]Oh, nice! Now, both terms have a common factor of ((b - 2)), so we can factor that out:[(a - 3)(b - 2) = 0]So, this gives us two possibilities:1. (a - 3 = 0) which implies (a = 3)2. (b - 2 = 0) which implies (b = 2)Let's consider each case separately.**Case 1: (a = 3)**Recall that (a = log_{2} x), so:[log_{2} x = 3]To solve for (x), we can rewrite this in exponential form:[x = 2^3 = 8]So, one possible solution is (x = 8).**Case 2: (b = 2)**Similarly, (b = log_{3} x), so:[log_{3} x = 2]Again, converting to exponential form:[x = 3^2 = 9]So, another possible solution is (x = 9).Now, I should check both solutions in the original equation to make sure they don't result in any undefined expressions or inconsistencies.**Checking (x = 8):**First, compute each logarithm:- (log_{2} 8 = 3) because (2^3 = 8)- (log_{3} 8) is approximately (log_{3} 8 approx 1.892)- (log_{3}(8^3) = log_{3} 512). Since (3^6 = 729) which is larger than 512, so it's less than 6. Let me compute it more accurately: (log_{3} 512 = frac{ln 512}{ln 3} approx frac{6.238}{1.0986} approx 5.68)- (log_{2}(8^2) = log_{2} 64 = 6) because (2^6 = 64)Now, plug into the original equation:Left side: (3 times 1.892 approx 5.676)Right side: (5.68 + 6 - 6 = 5.68)These are approximately equal, considering the rounding. So, (x = 8) is a valid solution.**Checking (x = 9):**Compute each logarithm:- (log_{2} 9) is approximately (log_{2} 9 approx 3.1699)- (log_{3} 9 = 2) because (3^2 = 9)- (log_{3}(9^3) = log_{3} 729 = 6) because (3^6 = 729)- (log_{2}(9^2) = log_{2} 81). Since (2^6 = 64) and (2^7 = 128), so it's between 6 and 7. Let's compute it: (log_{2} 81 = frac{ln 81}{ln 2} approx frac{4.394}{0.693} approx 6.34)Now, plug into the original equation:Left side: (3.1699 times 2 approx 6.3398)Right side: (6 + 6.34 - 6 = 6.34)Again, these are approximately equal, so (x = 9) is also a valid solution.Therefore, both (x = 8) and (x = 9) satisfy the original equation.Wait a second, but I should also consider the domain of the original equation. Since logarithms are only defined for positive real numbers, (x) must be greater than 0. Both 8 and 9 are positive, so that's fine.Is there any chance I missed another solution? Let me think. When I factored the equation, I got two cases, each leading to one solution. So, unless there's a mistake in my factoring, these should be the only solutions.Let me double-check my factoring step. Starting from:[ab - 2a - 3b + 6 = 0]I grouped as:[(a(b - 2) - 3(b - 2)) = 0]Which factors to:[(a - 3)(b - 2) = 0]Yes, that seems correct. So, no, I don't think I missed any solutions.Alternatively, another approach could be to express both logarithms in terms of a single base, say base 2 or base 3, and then set up an equation in terms of a single variable. Let me try that as a verification.Let me express (log_{3} x) in terms of (log_{2} x). Using the change of base formula:[log_{3} x = frac{log_{2} x}{log_{2} 3}]Let me denote (a = log_{2} x), so (log_{3} x = frac{a}{log_{2} 3}). Let me compute (log_{2} 3). Since (log_{2} 3 approx 1.58496), but I'll keep it as (log_{2} 3) for exactness.So, substituting into the original equation:Left side: (a cdot frac{a}{log_{2} 3} = frac{a^2}{log_{2} 3})Right side: (log_{3}(x^3) + log_{2}(x^2) - 6 = 3 log_{3} x + 2 log_{2} x - 6 = 3 cdot frac{a}{log_{2} 3} + 2a - 6)So, putting it all together:[frac{a^2}{log_{2} 3} = frac{3a}{log_{2} 3} + 2a - 6]Multiply both sides by (log_{2} 3) to eliminate the denominator:[a^2 = 3a + 2a cdot log_{2} 3 - 6 cdot log_{2} 3]Bring all terms to one side:[a^2 - 3a - 2a cdot log_{2} 3 + 6 cdot log_{2} 3 = 0]Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe I can factor this equation. Let me see.Factor terms with (a):[a(a - 3 - 2 log_{2} 3) + 6 log_{2} 3 = 0]Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as:[a^2 - (3 + 2 log_{2} 3) a + 6 log_{2} 3 = 0]This is a quadratic equation in terms of (a). Let me denote (c = log_{2} 3), so the equation becomes:[a^2 - (3 + 2c) a + 6c = 0]Let me compute the discriminant to solve for (a):[D = (3 + 2c)^2 - 4 times 1 times 6c = 9 + 12c + 4c^2 - 24c = 9 - 12c + 4c^2]So, discriminant (D = 4c^2 - 12c + 9). Let me compute this:Since (c = log_{2} 3), which is approximately 1.58496, but let's see if (4c^2 - 12c + 9) is a perfect square.Indeed, (4c^2 - 12c + 9 = (2c - 3)^2). Let me check:[(2c - 3)^2 = 4c^2 - 12c + 9]Yes, exactly. So, discriminant (D = (2c - 3)^2). Therefore, the solutions are:[a = frac{(3 + 2c) pm (2c - 3)}{2}]Compute both possibilities:1. (a = frac{3 + 2c + 2c - 3}{2} = frac{4c}{2} = 2c)2. (a = frac{3 + 2c - (2c - 3)}{2} = frac{3 + 2c - 2c + 3}{2} = frac{6}{2} = 3)So, (a = 2c) or (a = 3).But (c = log_{2} 3), so (a = 2 log_{2} 3 = log_{2} 3^2 = log_{2} 9). Therefore, (a = log_{2} 9) or (a = 3).Recall that (a = log_{2} x), so:1. If (a = 3), then (x = 2^3 = 8)2. If (a = log_{2} 9), then (x = 9)So, same solutions as before: (x = 8) and (x = 9). Therefore, this method also confirms the solutions.I think I can be confident that both (x = 8) and (x = 9) are solutions to the original equation. There's no indication of any extraneous solutions here, as both check out when substituted back into the equation.Just to recap, the steps I took were:1. Recognize that the equation involves logarithms with different bases.2. Use substitution to simplify the equation into a more manageable form.3. Factor the resulting equation to find potential solutions.4. Solve for (x) in each case.5. Verify the solutions by plugging them back into the original equation.6. Additionally, tried an alternative method by expressing all logarithms in terms of a single base, leading to the same solutions.Therefore, I conclude that the solutions are (x = 8) and (x = 9).**Final Answer**The solutions are (boxed{8}) and (boxed{9})."},{"question":"A basketball team has 12 players, with 6 players playing as forwards and 4 players playing as guards.

Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\\"A basketball team has 12 players, with 6 players playing as forwards and 4 players playing as guards. Players A and B can play both as forwards and guards. If the lineup consists of 3 forwards and 2 guards, the number of different lineups is ______.\\"Hmm, so the team has 12 players in total. Out of these, 6 are forwards, 4 are guards, and then there are Players A and B who can play both positions. So, I think that means A and B are included in both the forwards and guards counts. Wait, let me check that.If the team has 6 forwards and 4 guards, but A and B can play both, does that mean that the total number of players is 6 + 4 - 2 = 8? But wait, the problem says there are 12 players in total. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.Wait, perhaps the 6 forwards and 4 guards are separate, but A and B are counted in both. So, the total number of players would be 6 forwards + 4 guards - 2 (since A and B are counted twice) = 8 players. But the problem says there are 12 players. So, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the 6 forwards and 4 guards are exclusive, and then there are 2 more players who can play both positions. So, 6 + 4 + 2 = 12. That must be it. So, the team has 6 pure forwards, 4 pure guards, and 2 versatile players (A and B) who can play either position.So, when selecting the lineup, which consists of 3 forwards and 2 guards, we have to consider that A and B can be used as either forwards or guards. So, their inclusion can affect the counts.Let me think about how to approach this. Since A and B can be forwards or guards, they add flexibility to the lineup. So, when choosing 3 forwards and 2 guards, we might have different scenarios depending on whether A and/or B are selected as forwards or guards.I think the way to solve this is to break it down into cases based on how many of A and B are used as forwards or guards. Then, calculate the number of possible lineups for each case and sum them up.So, let's define the cases:Case 1: Neither A nor B is selected in the lineup. So, all 3 forwards are from the 6 pure forwards, and all 2 guards are from the 4 pure guards.Case 2: One of A or B is selected as a forward, and the other is not used as a guard. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many of A and B are used as forwards or guards.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider how many of A and B are selected as forwards, and how many are selected as guards.Wait, but each player can only be in one position in the lineup, right? So, if A is selected as a forward, they can't also be a guard. Similarly for B.So, the possible scenarios are:- Neither A nor B is selected in the lineup.- A is selected as a forward, and B is not selected.- B is selected as a forward, and A is not selected.- A is selected as a guard, and B is not selected.- B is selected as a guard, and A is not selected.- Both A and B are selected as forwards.- Both A and B are selected as guards.- One is selected as a forward and the other as a guard.Wait, that's a lot of cases. Maybe it's better to categorize based on how many of A and B are used in the lineup, regardless of position, and then consider their positions.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this using combinations, considering that A and B can be assigned to either position.Wait, maybe another approach is to think of the total number of forwards available and the total number of guards available, considering that A and B can be used as either.So, the total number of forwards available is 6 pure forwards + 2 versatile players (A and B) = 8 forwards.Similarly, the total number of guards available is 4 pure guards + 2 versatile players (A and B) = 6 guards.But wait, if we just take 8 forwards and 6 guards, and choose 3 forwards and 2 guards, we might be overcounting because A and B can't be in both positions at the same time.So, perhaps we need to adjust for that.Alternatively, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.Wait, let me think again.Total forwards: 6 pure + 2 versatile = 8.Total guards: 4 pure + 2 versatile = 6.But when selecting 3 forwards and 2 guards, we have to ensure that if we select A or B as a forward, they can't be selected as a guard, and vice versa.So, maybe the total number of possible lineups is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 forwards from 8 and 2 guards from 6, minus the cases where A or B are counted twice.Wait, no, that might not be the right approach.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:We can consider the versatile players (A and B) as being able to fill either position, so we need to account for how they are used in the lineup.So, the number of lineups can be calculated by considering all possible allocations of A and B into the lineup, either as forwards, guards, or not at all.So, let's break it down into cases based on how many of A and B are selected as forwards or guards.Case 1: Neither A nor B is selected.Then, we need to choose all 3 forwards from the 6 pure forwards, and all 2 guards from the 4 pure guards.Number of ways: C(6,3) * C(4,2).Case 2: Exactly one of A or B is selected as a forward.So, we choose 2 forwards from the 6 pure forwards, and 1 forward from A or B (2 choices). Then, we choose 2 guards from the 4 pure guards.Number of ways: C(6,2) * C(2,1) * C(4,2).Case 3: Both A and B are selected as forwards.So, we choose 1 forward from the 6 pure forwards, and both A and B as forwards. Then, choose 2 guards from the 4 pure guards.Number of ways: C(6,1) * C(2,2) * C(4,2).Case 4: Exactly one of A or B is selected as a guard.So, we choose 3 forwards from the 6 pure forwards, and 1 guard from A or B (2 choices). Then, choose 1 guard from the 4 pure guards.Number of ways: C(6,3) * C(2,1) * C(4,1).Case 5: Both A and B are selected as guards.So, we choose 3 forwards from the 6 pure forwards, and both A and B as guards. Then, no need to choose any more guards.Number of ways: C(6,3) * C(2,2).Case 6: One of A or B is selected as a forward, and the other as a guard.So, we choose 2 forwards from the 6 pure forwards, 1 forward from A or B (2 choices), 1 guard from the remaining versatile player (1 choice), and 1 guard from the 4 pure guards.Wait, no. If one is a forward and the other is a guard, then we have:Choose 2 forwards from 6 pure, plus 1 forward from A or B.Choose 1 guard from the remaining versatile player (since one is already used as a forward), plus 1 guard from the 4 pure guards.Wait, but actually, if we choose one of A or B as a forward, and the other as a guard, then:Number of ways: C(6,2) * C(2,1) [choosing which of A or B is forward] * C(1,1) [the other is guard] * C(4,1).Wait, that might be.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think:Number of ways to choose 3 forwards: 2 from pure forwards, 1 from A or B.Number of ways to choose 2 guards: 1 from the remaining versatile player (since one was used as forward), and 1 from pure guards.So, total ways: C(6,2) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) * C(4,1).But wait, C(1,1) is just 1, so it's C(6,2)*2*4.Wait, let me check.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as:Total lineups = sum over k=0 to 2 of [number of ways to choose k versatile players as forwards * number of ways to choose (3 - k) forwards from pure forwards * number of ways to choose (2 - l) guards from pure guards, where l is the number of versatile players used as guards, and k + l <= 2].But this might get complicated.Wait, maybe another approach is to consider that each versatile player can be in one of three states: not selected, selected as a forward, or selected as a guard.So, for each versatile player (A and B), there are 3 choices. But since we have two versatile players, the total number of possibilities is 3^2 = 9. However, not all of these will be valid, because we need exactly 3 forwards and 2 guards.Wait, perhaps this is getting too abstract.Alternatively, let's think of the problem as:We have 6 pure forwards, 4 pure guards, and 2 versatile players.We need to choose 3 forwards and 2 guards, with the versatile players able to fill either role.So, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 forwards from (6 + x) and 2 guards from (4 + y), where x and y are the number of versatile players assigned to forwards and guards, respectively, with x + y <= 2.But this might not be straightforward.Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all possible distributions of A and B:- Neither A nor B is used.- A is used as a forward, B is not used.- B is used as a forward, A is not used.- A is used as a guard, B is not used.- B is used as a guard, A is not used.- A is used as a forward, B is used as a guard.- A is used as a guard, B is used as a forward.- Both A and B are used as forwards.- Both A and B are used as guards.Wait, that's 9 cases, which is a lot, but maybe manageable.Let me list them:1. Neither A nor B is used.   Forwards: 3 from 6.   Guards: 2 from 4.   Number of ways: C(6,3)*C(4,2).2. A is forward, B not used.   Forwards: 2 from 6 + A.   Guards: 2 from 4.   Number of ways: C(6,2)*C(4,2).3. B is forward, A not used.   Similar to case 2.   Number of ways: C(6,2)*C(4,2).4. A is guard, B not used.   Forwards: 3 from 6.   Guards: 1 from 4 + A.   Number of ways: C(6,3)*C(4,1).5. B is guard, A not used.   Similar to case 4.   Number of ways: C(6,3)*C(4,1).6. A is forward, B is guard.   Forwards: 2 from 6 + A.   Guards: 1 from 4 + B.   Number of ways: C(6,2)*C(4,1).7. A is guard, B is forward.   Forwards: 2 from 6 + B.   Guards: 1 from 4 + A.   Number of ways: C(6,2)*C(4,1).8. Both A and B are forwards.   Forwards: 1 from 6 + A and B.   Guards: 2 from 4.   Number of ways: C(6,1)*C(4,2).9. Both A and B are guards.   Forwards: 3 from 6.   Guards: 0 from 4 + A and B.   Wait, but we need 2 guards. So, if both A and B are guards, then we need to choose 0 from pure guards, but we have to choose 2 guards, which would be A and B.   So, number of ways: C(6,3)*C(2,2).Wait, let me verify each case.Case 1: Neither A nor B.Forwards: 3 from 6.Guards: 2 from 4.Case 2: A is forward, B not used.Forwards: 2 from 6 + A.Guards: 2 from 4.Similarly for case 3.Case 4: A is guard, B not used.Forwards: 3 from 6.Guards: 1 from 4 + A.Case 5: B is guard, A not used.Same as case 4.Case 6: A forward, B guard.Forwards: 2 from 6 + A.Guards: 1 from 4 + B.Case 7: A guard, B forward.Same as case 6.Case 8: Both A and B forwards.Forwards: 1 from 6 + A and B.Guards: 2 from 4.Case 9: Both A and B guards.Forwards: 3 from 6.Guards: 0 from 4 + A and B. But since we need 2 guards, and A and B are both guards, that's 2 guards, so it's C(6,3)*C(2,2).Now, let's compute each case:Case 1: C(6,3)*C(4,2) = 20 * 6 = 120.Case 2: C(6,2)*C(4,2) = 15 * 6 = 90.Case 3: Same as case 2: 90.Case 4: C(6,3)*C(4,1) = 20 * 4 = 80.Case 5: Same as case 4: 80.Case 6: C(6,2)*C(4,1) = 15 * 4 = 60.Case 7: Same as case 6: 60.Case 8: C(6,1)*C(4,2) = 6 * 6 = 36.Case 9: C(6,3)*C(2,2) = 20 * 1 = 20.Now, let's add all these up:Case 1: 120Case 2: 90Case 3: 90Case 4: 80Case 5: 80Case 6: 60Case 7: 60Case 8: 36Case 9: 20Total: 120 + 90 + 90 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 60 + 36 + 20.Let me compute this step by step:Start with 120.Add 90: 210.Add 90: 300.Add 80: 380.Add 80: 460.Add 60: 520.Add 60: 580.Add 36: 616.Add 20: 636.So, total number of lineups is 636.Wait, that seems high. Let me check if I didn't double-count any cases.Wait, in case 6 and case 7, are they distinct? Because in case 6, A is forward and B is guard, while in case 7, A is guard and B is forward. So, they are distinct and should be counted separately.Similarly, cases 2 and 3 are distinct because they involve different players being forwards.Same with cases 4 and 5.So, the total seems correct.But let me think of another approach to verify.Alternative approach:Total number of lineups without considering the versatility of A and B would be C(6,3)*C(4,2) = 20*6=120.But since A and B can play both positions, we can include them in either forwards or guards, which increases the number of possible lineups.So, the total number should be more than 120, which it is (636).Alternatively, another way to compute is:Total forwards available: 6 + 2 = 8.Total guards available: 4 + 2 = 6.But since A and B can't be in both positions, we need to subtract the cases where A or B are counted in both.Wait, but this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, think of it as:The number of ways to choose 3 forwards and 2 guards, considering that A and B can be in either.So, the total number is equal to:C(8,3)*C(6,2) - C(2,1)*C(7,2)*C(5,1) + C(2,2)*C(6,1)*C(4,0).Wait, that's using inclusion-exclusion.Wait, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to model it as:Total lineups = C(8,3)*C(6,2) - C(2,1)*C(7,2)*C(5,1) + C(2,2)*C(6,1)*C(4,0).Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe this approach is complicating things.Alternatively, think of it as:Each versatile player can be assigned to either forward, guard, or not selected.So, for each of A and B, there are 3 choices: forward, guard, or not selected.But we need exactly 3 forwards and 2 guards.So, the number of ways is equal to the number of assignments of A and B such that the total forwards and guards are 3 and 2, respectively.So, let's define variables:Let x be the number of versatile players assigned as forwards.Let y be the number assigned as guards.We have x + y <= 2, since there are only 2 versatile players.Also, the total forwards selected: x + (3 - x) from pure forwards.Wait, no, the total forwards selected is 3, which includes x versatile players and (3 - x) pure forwards.Similarly, the total guards selected is 2, which includes y versatile players and (2 - y) pure guards.But since x and y are the number of versatile players assigned to forwards and guards, respectively, we have x + y <= 2.So, the possible values of x and y are:x can be 0,1,2y can be 0,1,2But with x + y <= 2.So, let's enumerate all possible (x,y):(0,0): x=0, y=0(0,1): x=0, y=1(0,2): x=0, y=2(1,0): x=1, y=0(1,1): x=1, y=1(2,0): x=2, y=0(2,1): Not possible, since x+y=3 >2Similarly, (1,2): same.So, the possible (x,y) pairs are:(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0).For each of these, compute the number of ways.Case (0,0): x=0, y=0.So, all forwards are pure: C(6,3).All guards are pure: C(4,2).Number of ways: C(6,3)*C(4,2) = 20*6=120.Case (0,1): x=0, y=1.So, 0 versatile forwards, 1 versatile guard.Forwards: 3 from pure: C(6,3).Guards: 1 from versatile (2 choices) + 1 from pure: C(4,1).Number of ways: C(6,3)*C(2,1)*C(4,1) = 20*2*4=160.Case (0,2): x=0, y=2.So, 0 versatile forwards, 2 versatile guards.Forwards: 3 from pure: C(6,3).Guards: 2 from versatile: C(2,2).Number of ways: C(6,3)*C(2,2)=20*1=20.Case (1,0): x=1, y=0.So, 1 versatile forward, 0 versatile guards.Forwards: 2 from pure + 1 versatile: C(6,2)*C(2,1).Guards: 2 from pure: C(4,2).Number of ways: C(6,2)*C(2,1)*C(4,2)=15*2*6=180.Case (1,1): x=1, y=1.So, 1 versatile forward, 1 versatile guard.Forwards: 2 from pure + 1 versatile: C(6,2)*C(2,1).Guards: 1 from pure + 1 versatile: C(4,1)*C(1,1).Wait, but since we've already assigned 1 versatile as forward, the other versatile can be assigned as guard.So, number of ways: C(6,2)*C(2,1) [choosing which versatile is forward] * C(4,1) [choosing the pure guard].Wait, but actually, since we have 2 versatile players, and we're assigning one as forward and one as guard, the number of ways is C(2,1) [choosing which versatile is forward] * C(6,2) [choosing pure forwards] * C(4,1) [choosing pure guards].So, total ways: 2 * 15 * 4 = 120.Case (2,0): x=2, y=0.So, 2 versatile forwards, 0 versatile guards.Forwards: 1 from pure + 2 versatile: C(6,1)*C(2,2).Guards: 2 from pure: C(4,2).Number of ways: C(6,1)*C(2,2)*C(4,2)=6*1*6=36.Now, let's add up all these cases:Case (0,0): 120Case (0,1): 160Case (0,2): 20Case (1,0): 180Case (1,1): 120Case (2,0): 36Total: 120 + 160 = 280; 280 + 20 = 300; 300 + 180 = 480; 480 + 120 = 600; 600 + 36 = 636.So, same result as before: 636.Therefore, the number of different lineups is 636.Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct?Because when I considered cases earlier, I had 9 cases, but in this approach, I have 6 cases, but the total is the same.Yes, because in the first approach, cases 6 and 7 were separate, but in this approach, they are combined into case (1,1).So, both methods give the same total.Therefore, I think 636 is the correct answer.But let me just think if there's another way to compute this.Another approach: The total number of lineups is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 forwards and 2 guards, considering that A and B can be in either.So, the total number is:C(8,3) * C(6,2) - C(2,1)*C(7,2)*C(5,1) + C(2,2)*C(6,1)*C(4,0).Wait, that's inclusion-exclusion.Wait, let me explain.First, compute the total number of ways without considering the overlap: C(8,3)*C(6,2).But this counts the cases where A and B are counted in both forwards and guards, which is impossible.So, we need to subtract the cases where A or B are counted in both.So, first, compute total: C(8,3)*C(6,2) = 56*15=840.Now, subtract the cases where A is counted as both forward and guard.Similarly for B.Number of such cases: For each of A and B, compute the number of lineups where they are counted in both positions.For A: Choose 2 forwards from the remaining 7 (since A is already chosen as forward), and 1 guard from the remaining 5 (since A is already chosen as guard). So, C(7,2)*C(5,1)=21*5=105.Similarly for B: 105.So, total overcount: 2*105=210.But now, we've subtracted too much because the cases where both A and B are counted in both positions have been subtracted twice. So, we need to add them back once.Number of such cases: Choose 1 forward from remaining 6 (since both A and B are chosen as forwards), and 0 guards from remaining 4 (since both A and B are chosen as guards). Wait, but we need 2 guards, so if both A and B are counted as guards, then we have 2 guards, so we don't need to choose any more.Wait, actually, if both A and B are counted as forwards and guards, which is impossible, but in our initial count, they were counted in both.Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of lineups where both A and B are counted in both positions is zero, because a player can't be in two positions at once.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Alternatively, the inclusion-exclusion formula for two sets is:Total = |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.But in this case, |A| is the number of lineups where A is counted in both positions, and |B| is the same for B.|A ∩ B| is the number of lineups where both A and B are counted in both positions, which is impossible, so |A ∩ B|=0.Wait, but actually, in our case, |A| is the number of lineups where A is counted as both forward and guard, which is impossible, so |A|=0.Wait, no, in the initial count, we have C(8,3)*C(6,2)=840, which includes lineups where A is counted as a forward and also as a guard, which is impossible. So, we need to subtract those impossible cases.But how many such cases are there?For each player (A and B), the number of lineups where they are counted in both positions is:For A: Choose 2 forwards from the remaining 7 (since A is already a forward), and 1 guard from the remaining 5 (since A is already a guard). So, C(7,2)*C(5,1)=21*5=105.Similarly for B: 105.So, total overcount: 2*105=210.But since these are impossible, we subtract them from the total.So, total lineups: 840 - 210 = 630.But wait, in our previous calculation, we got 636. So, there's a discrepancy.Hmm, this suggests that inclusion-exclusion might not be the right approach here, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.Wait, let me check:Total lineups without considering overlap: C(8,3)*C(6,2)=56*15=840.Number of invalid lineups where A is counted in both positions: C(7,2)*C(5,1)=21*5=105.Similarly for B: 105.Total invalid: 210.So, valid lineups: 840 - 210=630.But earlier, using case analysis, I got 636.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is missing something.Wait, in the inclusion-exclusion, we subtracted the cases where A or B are counted in both positions, but in reality, when we subtract these, we might have subtracted some valid cases where A or B are used in only one position.Wait, no, because in the initial count, we have C(8,3)*C(6,2), which includes all possible combinations, including those where A and B are used in both positions, which are invalid.So, subtracting those invalid cases should give the correct total.But according to case analysis, it's 636, while inclusion-exclusion gives 630.So, there's a discrepancy of 6.Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches.Wait, let me check the inclusion-exclusion again.When we subtract the cases where A is counted in both positions, we have:For A: C(7,2)*C(5,1)=21*5=105.Similarly for B: 105.Total: 210.But perhaps this is incorrect because when we subtract these, we might be over-subtracting cases where both A and B are counted in both positions.Wait, but in reality, can both A and B be counted in both positions? That would mean each is counted as both forward and guard, which is impossible, so |A ∩ B|=0.Therefore, inclusion-exclusion formula would be:Total valid = Total - |A| - |B| + |A ∩ B|.But since |A ∩ B|=0, it's Total - |A| - |B|.So, 840 - 105 - 105=630.But according to case analysis, it's 636.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the case analysis is correct because it's more detailed, and the inclusion-exclusion is missing something.Wait, let me think again.In the inclusion-exclusion approach, we subtracted the cases where A is counted in both positions, but in reality, when we count C(8,3)*C(6,2), we are counting the cases where A is in both positions, but in reality, A can only be in one position.So, the number of invalid lineups is indeed 2*105=210, so valid lineups are 840-210=630.But according to case analysis, it's 636.So, there must be a mistake in one of the approaches.Wait, let me check the case analysis again.In the case analysis, when we considered (x,y) pairs, we had:Case (0,0): 120Case (0,1): 160Case (0,2): 20Case (1,0): 180Case (1,1): 120Case (2,0): 36Total: 636.But in the inclusion-exclusion approach, we have 630.So, the difference is 6.Wait, perhaps in the case analysis, I overcounted.Wait, in case (1,1), I had 120, which is 2*15*4=120.But let me check:When x=1, y=1, meaning one versatile is forward, one is guard.Number of ways: Choose which versatile is forward: 2 choices.Choose 2 pure forwards: C(6,2)=15.Choose 1 pure guard: C(4,1)=4.So, total: 2*15*4=120.That seems correct.Similarly, in case (1,0): 180.Which is C(6,2)*C(2,1)*C(4,2)=15*2*6=180.Wait, but C(4,2)=6, so 15*2*6=180.Yes.Similarly, case (0,1): C(6,3)*C(2,1)*C(4,1)=20*2*4=160.Yes.Case (2,0): C(6,1)*C(2,2)*C(4,2)=6*1*6=36.Yes.So, all cases seem correct.Therefore, the case analysis gives 636, while inclusion-exclusion gives 630.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is incorrect because when we subtract the cases where A is counted in both positions, we are subtracting more than necessary.Wait, let me think: when we compute C(8,3)*C(6,2), we are counting all possible combinations, including those where A is in both positions, which is impossible.But in reality, A can be in at most one position.So, the number of invalid lineups is the number of lineups where A is counted as both forward and guard, which is C(7,2)*C(5,1)=105, and similarly for B.So, total invalid: 210.Thus, valid lineups: 840 - 210=630.But according to case analysis, it's 636.So, the discrepancy is 6.Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is missing something.Wait, let me think about the case where both A and B are used as forwards and guards.Wait, but that's impossible, so |A ∩ B|=0.But in the inclusion-exclusion, we subtracted |A| and |B|, but perhaps we need to add back |A ∩ B|, which is zero.So, total valid=840 -105 -105 +0=630.But case analysis says 636.Wait, maybe the case analysis is correct because it's considering all possible assignments without over-subtracting.Alternatively, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is incorrect because when we subtract the cases where A is counted in both positions, we are also subtracting cases where A is only in one position but was mistakenly counted in both.Wait, no, because in the initial count, C(8,3)*C(6,2) counts all possible combinations, including those where A is in both positions, which are invalid.So, subtracting those invalid cases should give the correct total.But why is there a discrepancy?Wait, perhaps the case analysis is overcounting.Wait, in the case analysis, when we have x=1, y=1, we are counting the cases where A is forward and B is guard, and vice versa.But in the inclusion-exclusion approach, we are subtracting cases where A is in both positions, which includes cases where A is forward and guard, but not considering B.Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is not accounting for the fact that when both A and B are used, they can't be in both positions.Wait, maybe the inclusion-exclusion approach is only subtracting the cases where A is in both positions, but not considering the cases where both A and B are used in different positions.Wait, no, because in the inclusion-exclusion, we are only subtracting the cases where A or B are in both positions, regardless of the other.Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is correct, and the case analysis is overcounting.Wait, let me check the case analysis again.In case (1,1), we have 120 ways, which is 2*15*4=120.But in reality, when we have x=1, y=1, we are choosing one versatile as forward and one as guard.But in the inclusion-exclusion approach, we have subtracted the cases where A is in both positions, but in reality, in case (1,1), A is only in one position, so it's a valid case.Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is correct, and the case analysis is overcounting.Wait, but the case analysis seems to be correct because it's considering all possible assignments of A and B.Wait, maybe the inclusion-exclusion approach is missing something.Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 636, as per the case analysis.But to be sure, let me compute the total number of lineups using another method.Total number of lineups is equal to:Sum over k=0 to 2 of [C(2,k) * C(6,3 -k) * C(4,2 - (2 -k))].Wait, that might not make sense.Alternatively, think of it as:For each versatile player, they can be:- Not selected.- Selected as forward.- Selected as guard.But we need to ensure that the total forwards selected is 3 and guards is 2.So, the number of ways is equal to the coefficient of x^3 y^2 in the generating function:(1 + x + y)^2 * (1 + x)^6 * (1 + y)^4.Because each versatile player contributes (1 + x + y), each pure forward contributes (1 + x), and each pure guard contributes (1 + y).So, expanding this generating function and finding the coefficient of x^3 y^2 will give the total number of lineups.Let me compute this.First, (1 + x + y)^2 = 1 + 2x + 2y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2.Then, (1 + x)^6 = 1 + 6x + 15x^2 + 20x^3 + 15x^4 + 6x^5 + x^6.(1 + y)^4 = 1 + 4y + 6y^2 + 4y^3 + y^4.Now, we need to compute the product:(1 + 2x + 2y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2) * (1 + 6x + 15x^2 + 20x^3 + 15x^4 + 6x^5 + x^6) * (1 + 4y + 6y^2 + 4y^3 + y^4).We are interested in the coefficient of x^3 y^2.This seems complicated, but let's try to compute it step by step.First, compute the product of (1 + 2x + 2y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2) and (1 + 6x + 15x^2 + 20x^3 + 15x^4 + 6x^5 + x^6).Let me denote A = (1 + 2x + 2y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2).B = (1 + 6x + 15x^2 + 20x^3 + 15x^4 + 6x^5 + x^6).We need to compute A * B.Let me compute each term in A multiplied by B:1 * B = B = 1 + 6x + 15x^2 + 20x^3 + 15x^4 + 6x^5 + x^6.2x * B = 2x + 12x^2 + 30x^3 + 40x^4 + 30x^5 + 12x^6 + 2x^7.2y * B = 2y + 12xy + 30x^2 y + 40x^3 y + 30x^4 y + 12x^5 y + 2x^6 y.x^2 * B = x^2 + 6x^3 + 15x^4 + 20x^5 + 15x^6 + 6x^7 + x^8.2xy * B = 2xy + 12x^2 y + 30x^3 y + 40x^4 y + 30x^5 y + 12x^6 y + 2x^7 y.y^2 * B = y^2 + 6x y^2 + 15x^2 y^2 + 20x^3 y^2 + 15x^4 y^2 + 6x^5 y^2 + x^6 y^2.Now, sum all these terms:Let's collect terms by degree of x and y.We are interested in the coefficient of x^3 y^2.So, let's find all terms in the expansion where x^3 y^2.Looking through each multiplication:1. From 1 * B: There's no y^2 term, so no contribution.2. From 2x * B: Terms are in x, no y^2, so no contribution.3. From 2y * B: Terms are in y, but we need y^2, so no contribution.4. From x^2 * B: Terms are in x^2, no y^2, so no contribution.5. From 2xy * B: Let's see, when multiplying 2xy by B, we get terms like 2xy * 1 = 2xy, 2xy * 6x = 12x^2 y, etc. So, to get x^3 y^2, we need to find terms where x^3 y^2 comes from multiplying 2xy with a term in B that has x^2 y.Looking at B, the term with x^2 is 15x^2. So, 2xy * 15x^2 = 30x^3 y.But that's x^3 y, not x^3 y^2.Similarly, 2xy * 20x^3 = 40x^4 y, which is higher.Wait, maybe I'm not looking correctly.Wait, in 2xy * B, the term that would contribute to x^3 y^2 is when we multiply 2xy by a term in B that has x^2 y. But B doesn't have y terms, only x terms.So, actually, 2xy * B will only produce terms with y, not y^2.Similarly, y^2 * B will produce terms with y^2.So, let's look at y^2 * B.From y^2 * B, the term that contributes to x^3 y^2 is y^2 * 20x^3 = 20x^3 y^2.Similarly, from 2xy * B, is there a term that contributes to x^3 y^2?Wait, 2xy * B has terms like 2xy * 15x^2 = 30x^3 y, which is x^3 y, not x^3 y^2.Similarly, 2xy * 6x = 12x^2 y, etc.So, the only contribution to x^3 y^2 comes from y^2 * B, specifically y^2 * 20x^3 = 20x^3 y^2.But wait, that's only one term.Wait, but let me check other terms.From 2y * B: 2y * 15x^2 = 30x^2 y, which is x^2 y, not x^3 y^2.From x^2 * B: x^2 * 15x^2 = 15x^4, which is x^4, no y.From 2x * B: 2x * 15x^2 = 30x^3, no y.From 1 * B: 20x^3, no y.From 2xy * B: 2xy * 20x^3 = 40x^4 y, which is x^4 y.From y^2 * B: y^2 * 20x^3 = 20x^3 y^2.So, total contribution to x^3 y^2 is 20.But wait, that's only from y^2 * B.But in reality, we have other terms that might contribute.Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.Wait, let me think again.The generating function is (1 + x + y)^2 * (1 + x)^6 * (1 + y)^4.We need the coefficient of x^3 y^2.Alternatively, we can compute it as:Sum over k=0 to 2 of [C(2,k) * C(6,3 -k) * C(4,2 - (2 -k))].Wait, that might not be the right way.Alternatively, use the multinomial theorem.But perhaps it's easier to compute it as follows:The coefficient of x^3 y^2 in (1 + x + y)^2 is C(2,3,2) but that doesn't make sense.Wait, no, (1 + x + y)^2 expands to 1 + 2x + 2y + x^2 + 2xy + y^2.So, the coefficient of x^3 y^2 is zero in (1 + x + y)^2.Wait, no, because (1 + x + y)^2 only goes up to x^2 and y^2.So, the coefficient of x^3 y^2 in (1 + x + y)^2 is zero.Therefore, the total coefficient of x^3 y^2 in the entire generating function is the sum of the products of coefficients from each part.So, to get x^3 y^2, we can have:- From (1 + x + y)^2: x^a y^b.- From (1 + x)^6: x^c.- From (1 + y)^4: y^d.Such that a + c = 3 and b + d = 2.So, we need to find all combinations where a + c = 3 and b + d = 2, with a, b, c, d non-negative integers, and a <=2, b <=2, c <=6, d <=4.So, let's list all possible (a, b, c, d):Case 1: a=0, b=0, c=3, d=2.Coefficient: C(2,0,0) * C(6,3) * C(4,2).But C(2,0,0) is the coefficient of x^0 y^0 in (1 + x + y)^2, which is 1.So, contribution: 1 * 20 * 6 = 120.Case 2: a=0, b=1, c=3, d=1.Coefficient: C(2,0,1) * C(6,3) * C(4,1).C(2,0,1) is the coefficient of x^0 y^1 in (1 + x + y)^2, which is 2.Contribution: 2 * 20 * 4 = 160.Case 3: a=0, b=2, c=3, d=0.Coefficient: C(2,0,2) * C(6,3) * C(4,0).C(2,0,2) is 1.Contribution: 1 * 20 * 1 = 20.Case 4: a=1, b=0, c=2, d=2.Coefficient: C(2,1,0) * C(6,2) * C(4,2).C(2,1,0) is 2.Contribution: 2 * 15 * 6 = 180.Case 5: a=1, b=1, c=2, d=1.Coefficient: C(2,1,1) * C(6,2) * C(4,1).C(2,1,1) is 2.Contribution: 2 * 15 * 4 = 120.Case 6: a=1, b=2, c=2, d=0.Coefficient: C(2,1,2) * C(6,2) * C(4,0).C(2,1,2) is 0, since (1 + x + y)^2 doesn't have x^1 y^2 term.Wait, actually, (1 + x + y)^2 has terms up to x^2 y^2, but the coefficient of x^1 y^2 is zero.So, contribution: 0.Case 7: a=2, b=0, c=1, d=2.Coefficient: C(2,2,0) * C(6,1) * C(4,2).C(2,2,0) is 1.Contribution: 1 * 6 * 6 = 36.Case 8: a=2, b=1, c=1, d=1.Coefficient: C(2,2,1) * C(6,1) * C(4,1).C(2,2,1) is 0, since (1 + x + y)^2 doesn't have x^2 y^1 term.Contribution: 0.Case 9: a=2, b=2, c=1, d=0.Coefficient: C(2,2,2) * C(6,1) * C(4,0).C(2,2,2) is 1.Contribution: 1 * 6 * 1 = 6.Wait, but in (1 + x + y)^2, the coefficient of x^2 y^2 is 1.So, contribution: 1 * 6 * 1 = 6.But wait, in this case, a=2, b=2, c=1, d=0.But c=1 and d=0, so total x^3 y^2.Yes.So, total contributions:Case 1: 120Case 2: 160Case 3: 20Case 4: 180Case 5: 120Case 6: 0Case 7: 36Case 8: 0Case 9: 6Total: 120 + 160 = 280; 280 + 20 = 300; 300 + 180 = 480; 480 + 120 = 600; 600 + 36 = 636; 636 + 6 = 642.Wait, that's 642, which is different from both previous results.Wait, that can't be right.Wait, I think I made a mistake in case 9.In case 9: a=2, b=2, c=1, d=0.But (1 + x + y)^2 has a term x^2 y^2 with coefficient 1.So, contribution: 1 * C(6,1) * C(4,0) = 6 * 1 = 6.But wait, in this case, we're choosing 2 forwards from versatile (a=2), 2 guards from versatile (b=2), but we only have 2 versatile players, so this is possible only if both are used as both forwards and guards, which is impossible.Wait, so actually, this case is invalid because a player can't be both a forward and a guard.Therefore, this case should not be counted.So, the contribution from case 9 should be zero.Therefore, total is 636.Yes, that matches the case analysis.So, the generating function approach confirms that the total number of lineups is 636.Therefore, the correct answer is 636."},{"question":"Find the sum of the maximum and minimum values offrac{1}{1+(2 cos x - 4 sin x)^{2}}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of the maximum and minimum values of the function ( frac{1}{1+(2 cos x - 4 sin x)^2} ). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I know that the function involves trigonometric functions, specifically cosine and sine. The expression inside the denominator is ( (2 cos x - 4 sin x)^2 ). Maybe I can simplify that part first. I remember that expressions like ( a cos x + b sin x ) can be rewritten using a single trigonometric function with a phase shift. Maybe that can help me here.Let me recall the identity: ( a cos x + b sin x = R cos(x - phi) ), where ( R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ) and ( phi = arctanleft(frac{b}{a}right) ). Wait, in my case, it's ( 2 cos x - 4 sin x ), so that would be ( a = 2 ) and ( b = -4 ). Let me compute R first.Calculating R: ( R = sqrt{2^2 + (-4)^2} = sqrt{4 + 16} = sqrt{20} = 2sqrt{5} ). Okay, so R is ( 2sqrt{5} ). Now, the phase angle ( phi ) would be ( arctanleft(frac{-4}{2}right) = arctan(-2) ). Hmm, arctangent of -2. That would be in the fourth quadrant, but since tangent is periodic, maybe I can just note it as ( phi = arctan(-2) ) or ( phi = -arctan(2) ).So, putting it all together, ( 2 cos x - 4 sin x = 2sqrt{5} cos(x - phi) ), where ( phi = arctan(-2) ). That simplifies the expression inside the square. So, the denominator becomes ( 1 + (2sqrt{5} cos(x - phi))^2 ).Let me write that out: ( 1 + (2sqrt{5} cos(x - phi))^2 = 1 + 4 times 5 cos^2(x - phi) = 1 + 20 cos^2(x - phi) ). So, the function simplifies to ( frac{1}{1 + 20 cos^2(x - phi)} ).Hmm, okay. So now, the function is ( frac{1}{1 + 20 cos^2 theta} ), where ( theta = x - phi ). Since ( theta ) is just a shifted angle, the range of ( cos^2 theta ) is still between 0 and 1, inclusive. So, ( cos^2 theta ) can vary from 0 to 1. Therefore, ( 20 cos^2 theta ) can vary from 0 to 20. Adding 1, the denominator can vary from 1 to 21.So, the function ( frac{1}{1 + 20 cos^2 theta} ) will take its maximum value when the denominator is minimized, and its minimum value when the denominator is maximized. That is, the maximum value is ( frac{1}{1} = 1 ) and the minimum value is ( frac{1}{21} ).Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me think again. If ( cos^2 theta ) is 0, then the denominator is 1, so the function is 1. If ( cos^2 theta ) is 1, the denominator is 21, so the function is ( 1/21 ). So, yes, the maximum value is 1 and the minimum is ( 1/21 ). Therefore, the sum of the maximum and minimum values is ( 1 + 1/21 = 22/21 ).But wait, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that ( 2 cos x - 4 sin x ) could take a value outside the range ( [-2sqrt{5}, 2sqrt{5}] )? No, because the amplitude R is ( 2sqrt{5} ), so the maximum and minimum of ( 2 cos x - 4 sin x ) are indeed ( 2sqrt{5} ) and ( -2sqrt{5} ). Therefore, when squared, it's between 0 and ( (2sqrt{5})^2 = 20 ). So, the denominator is between 1 and 21, so the function is between ( 1/21 ) and 1. So, the maximum is 1, the minimum is ( 1/21 ), and their sum is ( 22/21 ).But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using calculus. Let me set ( f(x) = frac{1}{1 + (2 cos x - 4 sin x)^2} ). To find its extrema, I can take the derivative and set it equal to zero.First, let me denote ( u = 2 cos x - 4 sin x ), so ( f(x) = frac{1}{1 + u^2} ). Then, the derivative ( f'(x) ) is ( -2u cdot u' / (1 + u^2)^2 ). Setting this equal to zero, we have ( -2u cdot u' = 0 ). So, either ( u = 0 ) or ( u' = 0 ).Let me compute ( u' ). ( u = 2 cos x - 4 sin x ), so ( u' = -2 sin x - 4 cos x ). So, ( u' = -2 sin x - 4 cos x ). Setting ( u' = 0 ), we get ( -2 sin x - 4 cos x = 0 ), which simplifies to ( 2 sin x + 4 cos x = 0 ), or ( sin x = -2 cos x ). Dividing both sides by ( cos x ) (assuming ( cos x neq 0 )), we get ( tan x = -2 ). So, ( x = arctan(-2) + kpi ), where k is an integer.So, critical points occur at ( u = 0 ) and ( x = arctan(-2) + kpi ). Let me evaluate ( f(x) ) at these points.First, when ( u = 0 ), ( f(x) = 1/(1 + 0) = 1 ). That's the maximum value we found earlier.Next, when ( x = arctan(-2) + kpi ), let's compute ( u ) at these points. Let me compute ( u = 2 cos x - 4 sin x ). Let me set ( x = arctan(-2) ). Let me denote ( theta = arctan(-2) ). Then, ( tan theta = -2 ), so we can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is -2 and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse is ( sqrt{1 + 4} = sqrt{5} ).Therefore, ( cos theta = 1/sqrt{5} ) and ( sin theta = -2/sqrt{5} ). So, ( u = 2 cos theta - 4 sin theta = 2*(1/sqrt{5}) - 4*(-2/sqrt{5}) = 2/sqrt{5} + 8/sqrt{5} = 10/sqrt{5} = 2sqrt{5} ). Similarly, at ( x = theta + pi ), ( cos(x) = cos(theta + pi) = -cos theta = -1/sqrt{5} ), and ( sin(x) = sin(theta + pi) = -sin theta = 2/sqrt{5} ). So, ( u = 2*(-1/sqrt{5}) - 4*(2/sqrt{5}) = -2/sqrt{5} - 8/sqrt{5} = -10/sqrt{5} = -2sqrt{5} ). Therefore, ( u^2 = (2sqrt{5})^2 = 20 ) in both cases.So, ( f(x) = 1/(1 + 20) = 1/21 ). So, that's the minimum value.Therefore, whether I approach it by rewriting the expression using the amplitude-phase form or by taking derivatives, I get the same result: the maximum value is 1, the minimum is ( 1/21 ), and their sum is ( 1 + 1/21 = 22/21 ).Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the derivative approach again. So, ( f(x) = 1/(1 + u^2) ), ( u = 2 cos x - 4 sin x ). Then, ( f'(x) = -2u u' / (1 + u^2)^2 ). Setting this equal to zero, so either ( u = 0 ) or ( u' = 0 ). When ( u = 0 ), ( f(x) = 1 ). When ( u' = 0 ), we found that ( u = pm 2sqrt{5} ), leading to ( f(x) = 1/21 ). So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the expression ( 2 cos x - 4 sin x ). Since this is a linear combination of sine and cosine, its maximum and minimum can be found using the amplitude method, which we did earlier. So, the maximum value of ( |2 cos x - 4 sin x| ) is ( 2sqrt{5} ), so the square is 20, leading to the denominator being 21, hence the function value being ( 1/21 ). The minimum value of the square is 0, so the function is 1. So, again, the sum is 22/21.Therefore, I feel confident that the sum of the maximum and minimum values is ( 22/21 ).**Final Answer**The sum of the maximum and minimum values is boxed{dfrac{22}{21}}."},{"question":"Given that the graph of a linear function y=kx+b passes through the points left(1,2right) and left(-1,6right).(1) Find the expression of this linear function;(2) If the graph of this linear function intersects the x-axis at point A and the y-axis at point B, find the value of S_{triangle OAB}.","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about a linear function. It says the graph passes through two points: (1, 2) and (-1, 6). There are two parts: first, I need to find the expression of the linear function, which is in the form y = kx + b. Second, I need to find the area of the triangle formed by the x-intercept (point A), y-intercept (point B), and the origin (O). Starting with part (1). I remember that a linear function has the form y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. Here, they use k instead of m, so it's y = kx + b. So, I need to find k and b. To find the slope (k), I can use the two given points. The formula for slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Let me plug in the points (1, 2) and (-1, 6). So, y2 is 6, y1 is 2, x2 is -1, and x1 is 1. Plugging into the formula: (6 - 2)/(-1 - 1) = 4/(-2) = -2. So, the slope k is -2. Now, with the slope known, I can use one of the points to find b, the y-intercept. Let's use the point (1, 2). Plugging into y = kx + b: 2 = (-2)(1) + b. That simplifies to 2 = -2 + b. Adding 2 to both sides, I get b = 4. So, putting it all together, the linear function is y = -2x + 4. Let me double-check with the other point (-1, 6). Plugging into the equation: y = -2*(-1) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6. Yep, that works. So, part (1) is done.Moving on to part (2). I need to find the area of triangle OAB, where A is the x-intercept and B is the y-intercept. First, let's find the x-intercept (point A). The x-intercept occurs where y = 0. So, set y = 0 in the equation and solve for x. 0 = -2x + 4. Adding 2x to both sides: 2x = 4. Dividing both sides by 2: x = 2. So, point A is (2, 0).Next, the y-intercept (point B) is where x = 0. Plugging x = 0 into the equation: y = -2*0 + 4 = 4. So, point B is (0, 4).Now, I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The triangle is formed by the points O (origin, (0,0)), A (2, 0), and B (0, 4). I remember that the area of a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (a, 0), and (0, b) is given by (1/2)*|a*b|. So, in this case, a is 2 and b is 4. Calculating the area: (1/2)*|2*4| = (1/2)*8 = 4. So, the area is 4 square units.Wait, let me visualize this to make sure. The triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs along the x-axis and y-axis. The base is from (0,0) to (2,0), which is 2 units, and the height is from (0,0) to (0,4), which is 4 units. The area formula for a right-angled triangle is indeed (base * height)/2, so (2*4)/2 = 4. Yep, that seems correct.Alternatively, I could use the formula for the area of a triangle given three points. The formula is |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|. Plugging in O(0,0), A(2,0), and B(0,4):Area = |(0*(0 - 4) + 2*(4 - 0) + 0*(0 - 0))/2| = |0 + 8 + 0|/2 = 8/2 = 4. Same result. So, I'm confident the area is 4.Just to recap: For part (1), I found the slope using two points, then used point-slope to find the y-intercept. For part (2), I found the intercepts by setting y=0 and x=0, then applied the area formula for a right-angled triangle. Both methods gave consistent results, so I think I did it right.**Final Answer**(1) The linear function is boxed{y = -2x + 4}.(2) The area of triangle ( OAB ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"A month with 31 days has the same number of Mondays and Wednesdays. How many of the seven days of the week could be the first day of this month?textbf{(A)} 2 qquad textbf{(B)} 3 qquad textbf{(C)} 4 qquad textbf{(D)} 5 qquad textbf{(E)} 6","answer":"First, I recognize that a month with 31 days will have 4 full weeks (28 days) plus 3 additional days. This means that each day of the week will occur at least 4 times, and three days will occur one more time.To have the same number of Mondays and Wednesdays, both Mondays and Wednesdays must either occur exactly 4 times or exactly 5 times. If they occurred 4 times, the three extra days would not include either Monday or Wednesday. If they occurred 5 times, both Monday and Wednesday would need to be among the three extra days.Next, I'll consider the possible starting days of the month and determine how the extra three days align with Mondays and Wednesdays. By analyzing each starting day, I can identify which ones satisfy the condition of having an equal number of Mondays and Wednesdays.After evaluating all starting days, I'll count how many of them meet the requirement.

The equations are nonlinear because of the squared terms, so it might be a bit tricky. Let me see how I can approach this.First, maybe I can try to express one variable in terms of the others from one equation and substitute it into the others. Let me look at equation (1):( x^2 + y - 2z = -3 )I can solve for y here:( y = -3 - x^2 + 2z )  quad text{(1a)}Okay, so now I can substitute this expression for y into equations (2) and (3). Let's do that.Starting with equation (2):( 3x + y + z^2 = 14 )Substituting y from (1a):( 3x + (-3 - x^2 + 2z) + z^2 = 14 )Simplify this:( 3x - 3 - x^2 + 2z + z^2 = 14 )Let me rearrange the terms:( -x^2 + 3x + z^2 + 2z - 3 - 14 = 0 )Simplify constants:( -x^2 + 3x + z^2 + 2z - 17 = 0 )Hmm, that's equation (2a). Let me write it as:( -x^2 + 3x + z^2 + 2z = 17 )  quad text{(2a)}Now, moving on to equation (3):( 7x - y^2 + 4z = 25 )Again, substitute y from (1a):( 7x - (-3 - x^2 + 2z)^2 + 4z = 25 )Oh boy, that looks complicated because of the squared term. Let me compute ( (-3 - x^2 + 2z)^2 ) step by step.Let me denote ( A = -3 - x^2 + 2z ), so ( A^2 = ( -3 - x^2 + 2z )^2 )Expanding this:( A^2 = (-3)^2 + (-x^2)^2 + (2z)^2 + 2*(-3)*(-x^2) + 2*(-3)*(2z) + 2*(-x^2)*(2z) )Calculating each term:1. ( (-3)^2 = 9 )2. ( (-x^2)^2 = x^4 )3. ( (2z)^2 = 4z^2 )4. ( 2*(-3)*(-x^2) = 6x^2 )5. ( 2*(-3)*(2z) = -12z )6. ( 2*(-x^2)*(2z) = -4x^2 z )So putting it all together:( A^2 = 9 + x^4 + 4z^2 + 6x^2 - 12z - 4x^2 z )Therefore, equation (3) becomes:( 7x - (9 + x^4 + 4z^2 + 6x^2 - 12z - 4x^2 z) + 4z = 25 )Simplify this:( 7x - 9 - x^4 - 4z^2 - 6x^2 + 12z + 4x^2 z + 4z = 25 )Combine like terms:- The x terms: 7x- The constants: -9- The x^4 term: -x^4- The z^2 term: -4z^2- The x^2 terms: -6x^2 + 4x^2 z- The z terms: 12z + 4z = 16zSo putting it all together:( -x^4 - 6x^2 + 4x^2 z + 7x - 4z^2 + 16z - 9 = 25 )Bring the 25 to the left side:( -x^4 - 6x^2 + 4x^2 z + 7x - 4z^2 + 16z - 9 - 25 = 0 )Simplify constants:( -x^4 - 6x^2 + 4x^2 z + 7x - 4z^2 + 16z - 34 = 0 )That's equation (3a). Hmm, that's a pretty complicated equation. Maybe I can factor or simplify it somehow, but it's a quartic equation which is tough.Let me recap:From equation (1a): ( y = -3 - x^2 + 2z )Equation (2a): ( -x^2 + 3x + z^2 + 2z = 17 )Equation (3a): ( -x^4 - 6x^2 + 4x^2 z + 7x - 4z^2 + 16z - 34 = 0 )This seems complicated. Maybe I can find integer solutions by testing small integer values for x and z? Since the equations have integer coefficients, perhaps the solutions are integers.Let me try that approach.First, from equation (2a):( -x^2 + 3x + z^2 + 2z = 17 )Let me rearrange it:( z^2 + 2z - x^2 + 3x = 17 )Maybe I can complete the square for z and x.For z: ( z^2 + 2z = (z + 1)^2 - 1 )For x: ( -x^2 + 3x = -(x^2 - 3x) = -left( (x - 1.5)^2 - 2.25 right) = - (x - 1.5)^2 + 2.25 )So substituting back into equation (2a):( (z + 1)^2 - 1 - (x - 1.5)^2 + 2.25 = 17 )Simplify constants:( (z + 1)^2 - (x - 1.5)^2 + 1.25 = 17 )So,( (z + 1)^2 - (x - 1.5)^2 = 17 - 1.25 = 15.75 )Hmm, 15.75 is equal to 63/4. Not sure if that helps, but maybe.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of possible integer values for z and x that satisfy equation (2a). Let me try small integers for x and see if z comes out as integer.Let me try x=1:Plug x=1 into equation (2a):( -1 + 3*1 + z^2 + 2z = 17 )Simplify:( -1 + 3 + z^2 + 2z = 17 )( 2 + z^2 + 2z = 17 )( z^2 + 2z = 15 )( z^2 + 2z - 15 = 0 )Solve quadratic:z = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 60)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(64)] / 2 = [-2 ± 8]/2So z = (6)/2=3 or z=(-10)/2=-5So z=3 or z=-5. Let's check.First, x=1, z=3.Then from equation (1a): y = -3 -1 + 2*3 = -4 +6=2So y=2. Let's check equation (3):7*1 - (2)^2 +4*3=7 -4 +12=15. But equation (3) is supposed to be 25. 15≠25.

Nope.So x=-3 doesn't work.So far, only x=2, z=3, y=-1 is a solution.Let me check x= -4:Equation (2a): -16 + (-12) + z^2 +2z=17Simplify: -28 + z^2 +2z=17z^2 +2z=45z^2 +2z -45=0Solutions: z=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +180))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(184))/2= (-2 ±2*sqrt(46))/2= -1 ±sqrt(46).

Non-integer.Hmm, seems like x=2 is the only integer solution so far. Maybe there are non-integer solutions, but since the problem didn't specify, maybe x=2, y=-1, z=3 is the only solution.But just to be thorough, let me check x=1.5, since in equation (2a) when I completed the square, I had (x - 1.5)^2.x=1.5:Equation (2a): -(1.5)^2 +3*(1.5) + z^2 +2z=17Calculate:-2.25 +4.5 + z^2 +2z=172.25 + z^2 +2z=17z^2 +2z=14.75z^2 +2z -14.75=0Solutions: z=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +59))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(63))/2≈ (-2 ±7.94)/2So z≈(5.94)/2≈2.97 or z≈(-9.94)/2≈-4.97. Not integers, but maybe approximate.But since we already have an integer solution, maybe that's the only one.Alternatively, perhaps there are other solutions where variables are not integers.But solving this system algebraically might be complicated because of the quartic equation. Maybe I can use substitution.From equation (1a): y = -3 -x^2 +2zFrom equation (2a): -x^2 +3x + z^2 +2z=17Let me write equation (2a) as:z^2 +2z = x^2 -3x +17So, z^2 +2z = x^2 -3x +17Let me denote this as equation (2b).From equation (1a), y is expressed in terms of x and z.From equation (3a): -x^4 -6x^2 +4x^2 z +7x -4z^2 +16z -34=0This looks really messy. Maybe I can substitute z^2 from equation (2b) into equation (3a).From equation (2b): z^2 = x^2 -3x +17 -2zSo, z^2 = x^2 -3x +17 -2zLet me plug this into equation (3a):- x^4 -6x^2 +4x^2 z +7x -4*(x^2 -3x +17 -2z) +16z -34=0Simplify term by term:First term: -x^4Second term: -6x^2Third term: +4x^2 zFourth term: +7xFifth term: -4*(x^2 -3x +17 -2z)= -4x^2 +12x -68 +8zSixth term: +16zSeventh term: -34So, combine all terms:- x^4 -6x^2 +4x^2 z +7x -4x^2 +12x -68 +8z +16z -34=0Now, combine like terms:- x^4For x^2 z: +4x^2 zFor x^2: -6x^2 -4x^2= -10x^2For x terms: +7x +12x= +19xFor z terms: +8z +16z= +24zConstants: -68 -34= -102So equation becomes:- x^4 +4x^2 z -10x^2 +19x +24z -102=0Hmm, still complicated.

Maybe I can substitute this into equation (3a) or into the equation we just derived.But this seems getting too complicated. Maybe another approach.Wait, let's see. We have one solution already: x=2, y=-1, z=3.Perhaps that's the only real solution? Or maybe there are more.Alternatively, maybe I can subtract equations to eliminate variables.From equation (1): x^2 + y -2z = -3From equation (2): 3x + y + z^2 =14Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):(3x + y + z^2) - (x^2 + y -2z)=14 - (-3)Simplify:3x + y + z^2 -x^2 - y +2z=17So,- x^2 +3x + z^2 +2z=17Which is exactly equation (2a).

Let's see.Equation (1): x^2 + y -2z = -3Equation (3):7x - y^2 +4z=25Let me try to express y from equation (1) and substitute into equation (3). Wait, we already did that and got equation (3a).

Maybe set this equal to the expression for z from equation (2b):z= -1 ±sqrt(x^2 -3x +18)So,(x^2 +4)/4 + (-19x +78)/(4(x^2 +6)) = -1 ±sqrt(x^2 -3x +18)This seems too complicated to solve algebraically. Maybe numerical methods are needed, but since we already found an integer solution, perhaps that's the only real solution.Alternatively, maybe check if the quartic equation has other real roots.From equation (3a): -x^4 -6x^2 +4x^2 z +7x -4z^2 +16z -34=0But since z is expressed in terms of x, maybe substitute z from equation (2b) into this.Wait, equation (2b): z^2 +2z =x^2 -3x +17So, z^2= x^2 -3x +17 -2zPlug into equation (3a):- x^4 -6x^2 +4x^2 z +7x -4*(x^2 -3x +17 -2z) +16z -34=0Which simplifies to:- x^4 -10x^2 +4x^2 z +19x +24z -102=0Which is the same as before.Alternatively, maybe express z from equation (2b) as z= -1 ±sqrt(x^2 -3x +18) and substitute into equation (3a). But that leads to a complicated equation.Alternatively, maybe graph the equations or use substitution.But perhaps it's better to accept that x=2, y=-1, z=3 is the only real solution, especially since it's an integer solution and the problem might be designed that way.Therefore, the solution is x=2, y=-1, z=3.**Final Answer**The solution to the system is (boxed{x = 2}), (boxed{y = -1}), and (boxed{z = 3})."},{"question":"A three-digit number, with digits on the units, tens, and hundreds places denoted as x, y, and z respectively, is called a \\"convex number\\" only when y > x and y > z (for example, 341). Then the number of \\"convex numbers\\" that can be formed by selecting three distinct numbers from the set {1,2,3,4,5} is ____.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about convex numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. A three-digit number is called a \\"convex number\\" if the digit in the tens place is greater than both the units and hundreds digits. For example, 341 is a convex number because the tens digit, 4, is greater than both 3 and 1. The question is asking how many such convex numbers can be formed by selecting three distinct numbers from the set {1,2,3,4,5}. So, I need to count all possible three-digit numbers where the middle digit is the largest among the three, and all digits are distinct and come from that set.First, let me break down the problem. A three-digit number has three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let's denote them as z (hundreds), y (tens), and x (units). So, the number is zyx. For it to be a convex number, y must be greater than both z and x. Given that we are selecting three distinct digits from {1,2,3,4,5}, each digit can only be used once. So, z, y, and x must all be different.My plan is to figure out how many such numbers exist by considering the possible choices for y, since y has to be the largest digit. Once y is chosen, z and x must be selected from the remaining digits that are smaller than y.Let me think about it systematically. The set {1,2,3,4,5} has five elements. The digit y has to be greater than both z and x, so y must be at least 2 because the smallest possible y is 2 (since z and x have to be smaller, and digits are distinct). But actually, y can be 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let me go through each possible y and count the number of valid z and x combinations.Case 1: y = 2If y is 2, then z and x must be selected from the digits less than 2, which is only 1. But we need two distinct digits, z and x, both less than 2. However, there's only one digit less than 2, which is 1. So, we can't choose two distinct digits from just {1}. Therefore, there are 0 convex numbers in this case.Case 2: y = 3If y is 3, then z and x must be selected from {1,2}. There are two digits less than 3. We need to choose two distinct digits from these two, and then arrange them in the hundreds and units places. The number of ways to choose two digits from {1,2} is C(2,2) = 1. Then, for each selection, the two digits can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. So, total numbers in this case are 1 * 2 = 2.Wait, hold on. Let me verify. If y=3, then z and x can be 1 and 2. So, the possible numbers are 132 and 231. Yes, that's two numbers. So, 2 convex numbers when y=3.Case 3: y = 4If y is 4, then z and x must be selected from {1,2,3}. There are three digits less than 4. We need to choose two distinct digits from these three, and then arrange them in the hundreds and units places.The number of ways to choose two digits from three is C(3,2) = 3. For each selection, the two digits can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. So, total numbers in this case are 3 * 2 = 6.Let me list them to be sure. The possible pairs for z and x are {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}. For each pair:- {1,2}: 142 and 241- {1,3}: 143 and 341- {2,3}: 243 and 342So, that's 6 numbers. Correct.Case 4: y = 5If y is 5, then z and x must be selected from {1,2,3,4}. There are four digits less than 5. We need to choose two distinct digits from these four, and then arrange them in the hundreds and units places.The number of ways to choose two digits from four is C(4,2) = 6. For each selection, the two digits can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. So, total numbers in this case are 6 * 2 = 12.Again, let me list them to be thorough. The possible pairs for z and x are {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}. For each pair:- {1,2}: 152 and 251- {1,3}: 153 and 351- {1,4}: 154 and 451- {2,3}: 253 and 352- {2,4}: 254 and 452- {3,4}: 354 and 453Yep, that's 12 numbers. So, 12 convex numbers when y=5.Now, adding up all the cases:- y=2: 0- y=3: 2- y=4: 6- y=5: 12Total convex numbers = 0 + 2 + 6 + 12 = 20.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another way to approach this problem?Another approach: Since the middle digit must be the maximum, we can think of it as choosing three distinct digits from the set, then designating the largest as y, and then arranging the other two in the hundreds and units places.So, the number of convex numbers would be equal to the number of ways to choose three distinct digits from {1,2,3,4,5}, then for each such trio, the largest digit is fixed as y, and the other two can be arranged in 2 ways.So, the number of convex numbers is C(5,3) * 2.Calculating that: C(5,3) is 10, so 10 * 2 = 20.Wait, that's the same result as before. So, that seems to confirm it.But let me think again. When we choose three digits, say, 1,2,3, the largest is 3, so y=3, and then z and x can be 1 and 2, which can be arranged as 1 and 2 or 2 and 1. So, two numbers: 132 and 231.Similarly, for digits 1,2,4: y=4, z and x can be 1 and 2, giving 142 and 241.Wait, but in the first approach, when y=3, we had two numbers, when y=4, six numbers, and when y=5, twelve numbers. So, adding up to 20.Alternatively, using combinations: C(5,3) is 10, each contributing 2 numbers, so 20. So, both methods give the same result.Therefore, I think 20 is the correct answer.But just to be thorough, let me list all the possible convex numbers:For y=3:- 132, 231For y=4:- 142, 241, 143, 341, 243, 342For y=5:- 152, 251, 153, 351, 154, 451, 253, 352, 254, 452, 354, 453Counting these:y=3: 2 numbersy=4: 6 numbersy=5: 12 numbersTotal: 2 + 6 + 12 = 20 numbers.Yep, that's 20. So, I think 20 is the correct answer.I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Both approaches—case analysis and combination counting—give the same result, and enumerating all possibilities also leads to 20. So, I feel confident that the answer is 20.**Final Answer**The number of convex numbers is boxed{20}."},{"question":"Bill has 6 times as many nuts as Harry, and Harry has twice as many nuts as Sue.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that to find the area between a curve and the x-axis over a certain interval, I can use definite integrals. The area ( S ) is given by the integral of the absolute value of the function between the two x-values. But wait, do I need to take the absolute value here? Or can I just integrate the function as it is because I know where it's positive or negative?Let me check the function ( y = sin x - sqrt{3} cos x ). Maybe I can rewrite this in a simpler form. I recall that expressions like ( a sin x + b cos x ) can be written as a single sine (or cosine) function with a phase shift. The formula is ( R sin(x + phi) ) where ( R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ) and ( phi ) is the phase shift. Let me try that.In this case, ( a = 1 ) and ( b = -sqrt{3} ). So, ( R = sqrt{1^2 + (-sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2 ). Okay, so the amplitude is 2. Now, to find the phase shift ( phi ), I can use the formulas ( cos phi = frac{a}{R} ) and ( sin phi = frac{b}{R} ).Calculating that, ( cos phi = frac{1}{2} ) and ( sin phi = frac{-sqrt{3}}{2} ). Hmm, which angle has cosine 1/2 and sine -√3/2? That would be ( phi = -frac{pi}{3} ) because cosine is positive and sine is negative, so it's in the fourth quadrant. So, ( phi = -frac{pi}{3} ).Therefore, the function can be rewritten as ( y = 2 sinleft(x - frac{pi}{3}right) ). Let me verify that:( 2 sinleft(x - frac{pi}{3}right) = 2 left( sin x cos frac{pi}{3} - cos x sin frac{pi}{3} right) )( = 2 left( sin x cdot frac{1}{2} - cos x cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) )( = 2 cdot frac{1}{2} sin x - 2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos x )( = sin x - sqrt{3} cos x )Yes, that's correct. So, the function simplifies to ( y = 2 sinleft(x - frac{pi}{3}right) ). That might make it easier to analyze.Now, I need to find the area between this curve, the x-axis, and the lines ( x = frac{2pi}{3} ) and ( x = pi ). So, I should set up the integral from ( x = frac{2pi}{3} ) to ( x = pi ) of ( |y| , dx ). But since I know the function is a sine wave, I can figure out where it crosses the x-axis in this interval to determine if I need to split the integral.Wait, let me check if the function crosses the x-axis between ( frac{2pi}{3} ) and ( pi ). So, set ( y = 0 ):( 2 sinleft(x - frac{pi}{3}right) = 0 )( sinleft(x - frac{pi}{3}right) = 0 )So, ( x - frac{pi}{3} = npi ) for integer ( n )Therefore, ( x = frac{pi}{3} + npi )Looking at the interval ( frac{2pi}{3} ) to ( pi ), let's see if any of these solutions fall into this interval.For ( n = 0 ): ( x = frac{pi}{3} ) which is less than ( frac{2pi}{3} ), so not in our interval.For ( n = 1 ): ( x = frac{pi}{3} + pi = frac{4pi}{3} ), which is greater than ( pi ), so also not in our interval.Therefore, the function does not cross the x-axis between ( frac{2pi}{3} ) and ( pi ). So, the function is either entirely above or entirely below the x-axis in this interval. I need to check the sign of ( y ) in this interval.Let me pick a test point between ( frac{2pi}{3} ) and ( pi ). Let's choose ( x = frac{5pi}{6} ).Compute ( y = 2 sinleft( frac{5pi}{6} - frac{pi}{3} right) = 2 sinleft( frac{5pi}{6} - frac{2pi}{6} right) = 2 sinleft( frac{3pi}{6} right) = 2 sinleft( frac{pi}{2} right) = 2 times 1 = 2 ). So, positive.Therefore, the function is positive throughout the interval ( frac{2pi}{3} ) to ( pi ). So, the area is just the integral of ( y ) from ( frac{2pi}{3} ) to ( pi ).So, ( S = int_{frac{2pi}{3}}^{pi} left( sin x - sqrt{3} cos x right) dx )Alternatively, since we rewrote it as ( 2 sinleft(x - frac{pi}{3}right) ), we can use that form for easier integration.So, ( S = int_{frac{2pi}{3}}^{pi} 2 sinleft(x - frac{pi}{3}right) dx )Let me compute this integral.First, let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let ( u = x - frac{pi}{3} ). Then, ( du = dx ).When ( x = frac{2pi}{3} ), ( u = frac{2pi}{3} - frac{pi}{3} = frac{pi}{3} ).When ( x = pi ), ( u = pi - frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{3} ).So, the integral becomes:( S = int_{frac{pi}{3}}^{frac{2pi}{3}} 2 sin u , du )That's easier to integrate.The integral of ( sin u ) is ( -cos u ). So,( S = 2 left[ -cos u right]_{frac{pi}{3}}^{frac{2pi}{3}} )( = 2 left( -cos frac{2pi}{3} + cos frac{pi}{3} right) )Compute the cosine values:( cos frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2} )( cos frac{2pi}{3} = -frac{1}{2} )So,( S = 2 left( -(-frac{1}{2}) + frac{1}{2} right) )( = 2 left( frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} right) )( = 2 times 1 )( = 2 )Wait, so the area is 2? Hmm, let me double-check my steps.First, the substitution seems correct. ( u = x - pi/3 ), so limits change from ( 2pi/3 ) to ( pi ) into ( pi/3 ) to ( 2pi/3 ). Then, the integral of ( 2 sin u ) is indeed ( -2 cos u ).Evaluating from ( pi/3 ) to ( 2pi/3 ):At ( 2pi/3 ), ( -2 cos(2pi/3) = -2 (-1/2) = 1 )At ( pi/3 ), ( -2 cos(pi/3) = -2 (1/2) = -1 )So, subtracting, ( 1 - (-1) = 2 ). So, yes, the area is 2.Alternatively, if I had not substituted, let's compute the integral using the original function:( S = int_{frac{2pi}{3}}^{pi} (sin x - sqrt{3} cos x) dx )Integrate term by term:Integral of ( sin x ) is ( -cos x )Integral of ( cos x ) is ( sin x )So,( S = left[ -cos x - sqrt{3} sin x right]_{frac{2pi}{3}}^{pi} )Compute at ( x = pi ):( -cos pi - sqrt{3} sin pi = -(-1) - sqrt{3}(0) = 1 - 0 = 1 )Compute at ( x = frac{2pi}{3} ):( -cos frac{2pi}{3} - sqrt{3} sin frac{2pi}{3} )( = -(-1/2) - sqrt{3} (sqrt{3}/2) )( = 1/2 - (3/2) )( = 1/2 - 3/2 = -1 )Subtracting, ( 1 - (-1) = 2 ). So, same result.Therefore, the area is indeed 2.Wait, but just to make sure, let me visualize the function. The function is ( 2 sin(x - pi/3) ). So, it's a sine wave with amplitude 2, shifted to the right by ( pi/3 ). So, from ( x = 0 ) to ( x = 2pi ), it completes a full cycle.Between ( x = 2pi/3 ) and ( x = pi ), which is a span of ( pi/3 ), the function goes from ( x = 2pi/3 ) where ( u = pi/3 ) to ( x = pi ) where ( u = 2pi/3 ). So, in terms of the sine function, from ( pi/3 ) to ( 2pi/3 ), which is the ascending part of the sine wave from ( pi/3 ) to ( pi/2 ), and then descending from ( pi/2 ) to ( 2pi/3 ). Wait, but in this interval, the function is positive, as we saw earlier.But the integral gave us 2, which is the area. Hmm, seems correct.Alternatively, if I think about the graph, between ( 2pi/3 ) and ( pi ), the function starts at ( x = 2pi/3 ), which is ( 2 sin(pi/3) = 2*(√3/2) = √3 ), goes up to a maximum at ( x = pi/2 + pi/3 = 5pi/6 ), which is ( 2 sin(pi/2) = 2*1 = 2 ), and then comes back down to ( x = pi ), which is ( 2 sin(2pi/3) = 2*(√3/2) = √3 ). So, the graph is a hump from ( √3 ) up to 2 and back to ( √3 ). So, the area under this curve should be positive and equal to 2.Alternatively, if I compute the integral without substitution:( S = int_{frac{2pi}{3}}^{pi} (sin x - sqrt{3} cos x) dx )( = left[ -cos x - sqrt{3} sin x right]_{frac{2pi}{3}}^{pi} )At ( pi ): ( -(-1) - sqrt{3}(0) = 1 )At ( 2pi/3 ): ( -(-1/2) - sqrt{3}(sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 - 3/2 = -1 )So, ( 1 - (-1) = 2 ). Yep, same result.Therefore, I think the area is indeed 2.**Final Answer**The area ( S ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Let ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) be positive real numbers satisfying ( a + b + c + 2 = a b c ).Prove that[ (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) geq 27 . ]When does equality hold?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to prove that ((a+1)(b+1)(c+1) geq 27) given that (a), (b), and (c) are positive real numbers satisfying (a + b + c + 2 = abc). Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out how to approach this.First, let me write down what I know:1. (a), (b), and (c) are positive real numbers.2. They satisfy the equation (a + b + c + 2 = abc).3. I need to prove that ((a+1)(b+1)(c+1) geq 27).I remember that inequalities often involve techniques like AM-GM inequality, substitution, or maybe even Lagrange multipliers. Since all variables are positive, AM-GM might be a good starting point.Let me try expanding ((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)) to see if that gives me any clues.Expanding it:[(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = abc + ab + ac + bc + a + b + c + 1]So, that's equal to (abc + ab + ac + bc + a + b + c + 1).Looking at the given condition (a + b + c + 2 = abc), maybe I can substitute (abc) with (a + b + c + 2) in the expanded expression.Let me do that:[(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = (a + b + c + 2) + ab + ac + bc + a + b + c + 1]Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. If I substitute (abc) with (a + b + c + 2), then:[(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = abc + ab + ac + bc + a + b + c + 1 = (a + b + c + 2) + ab + ac + bc + a + b + c + 1]Wait, that seems like I'm adding (a + b + c) twice. Let me compute it step by step.Original expansion:[(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = abc + ab + ac + bc + a + b + c + 1]Given that (abc = a + b + c + 2), substitute:[= (a + b + c + 2) + ab + ac + bc + a + b + c + 1]Combine like terms:- (a + b + c) appears twice, so that's (2(a + b + c))- Then we have (ab + ac + bc)- Constants: 2 + 1 = 3So, altogether:[(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 2(a + b + c) + ab + ac + bc + 3]Hmm, okay. So now I have an expression in terms of (a + b + c) and (ab + ac + bc). Maybe I can relate these terms to each other or find some inequality that connects them.I recall that for positive real numbers, the AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Maybe I can apply that here.But before that, perhaps I can consider substitution to simplify the problem. Let me think: if I let (x = a + 1), (y = b + 1), and (z = c + 1), then (a = x - 1), (b = y - 1), (c = z - 1). Maybe this substitution can make the expression ((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)) into (xyz), which is what I need to find a lower bound for.Let me try that substitution.Given (a = x - 1), (b = y - 1), (c = z - 1), then:The given condition (a + b + c + 2 = abc) becomes:[(x - 1) + (y - 1) + (z - 1) + 2 = (x - 1)(y - 1)(z - 1)]Simplify the left side:[x - 1 + y - 1 + z - 1 + 2 = x + y + z - 3 + 2 = x + y + z - 1]Right side:[(x - 1)(y - 1)(z - 1)]So, the equation becomes:[x + y + z - 1 = (x - 1)(y - 1)(z - 1)]Hmm, not sure if this substitution is helpful yet. Maybe I can expand the right side:[(x - 1)(y - 1)(z - 1) = xyz - xy - xz - yz + x + y + z - 1]So, substituting back into the equation:[x + y + z - 1 = xyz - xy - xz - yz + x + y + z - 1]Wait, if I subtract (x + y + z - 1) from both sides, I get:[0 = xyz - xy - xz - yz]So,[xyz = xy + xz + yz]Hmm, interesting. So, from substitution, I get that (xyz = xy + xz + yz). Maybe this can be useful.But my target expression is (xyz), which is ((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)). So, if I can show that (xyz geq 27), that would solve the problem.Given that (xyz = xy + xz + yz), perhaps I can find a lower bound for (xyz) using this condition.Let me think about the relationship between (xyz) and (xy + xz + yz). I know that for positive real numbers, (xyz geq 3sqrt[3]{(xy)(xz)(yz)}) by AM-GM, but that might not be directly helpful here.Wait, actually, since (xyz = xy + xz + yz), perhaps I can apply AM-GM on (xy), (xz), (yz).AM-GM states that:[frac{xy + xz + yz}{3} geq sqrt[3]{(xy)(xz)(yz)} = sqrt[3]{x^2 y^2 z^2} = (xyz)^{2/3}]So,[frac{xy + xz + yz}{3} geq (xyz)^{2/3}]But since (xy + xz + yz = xyz), substitute:[frac{xyz}{3} geq (xyz)^{2/3}]Let me denote (t = (xyz)^{1/3}), so that (xyz = t^3). Then the inequality becomes:[frac{t^3}{3} geq t^2]Simplify:[frac{t^3}{3} - t^2 geq 0 implies t^2 left( frac{t}{3} - 1 right) geq 0]Since (t = (xyz)^{1/3}) and (x), (y), (z) are positive, (t > 0). So, (t^2) is always positive. Therefore, the inequality reduces to:[frac{t}{3} - 1 geq 0 implies t geq 3]Since (t = (xyz)^{1/3}), this implies:[(xyz)^{1/3} geq 3 implies xyz geq 27]Which is exactly what we needed to prove! So, ((a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = xyz geq 27).Now, for equality to hold, we need equality in AM-GM. In the step where I applied AM-GM to (xy), (xz), (yz), equality holds when (xy = xz = yz). Which implies that (x = y = z).So, if (x = y = z), then from the condition (xyz = xy + xz + yz), substituting (x = y = z = k), we get:[k^3 = 3k^2 implies k^3 - 3k^2 = 0 implies k^2(k - 3) = 0]Since (k > 0), we have (k = 3). Therefore, (x = y = z = 3), which implies (a = x - 1 = 2), (b = y - 1 = 2), (c = z - 1 = 2).Let me verify if this satisfies the original condition:(a + b + c + 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8)(abc = 2 times 2 times 2 = 8)Yes, it does satisfy (a + b + c + 2 = abc). So, equality holds when (a = b = c = 2).Therefore, I have proved that ((a+1)(b+1)(c+1) geq 27) with equality when (a = b = c = 2).**Final Answer**The inequality holds and equality occurs when (a = b = c = 2).

Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out which set of numbers is larger. Let me break it down step by step.First, let me understand the total number of five-digit numbers. Five-digit numbers range from 10000 to 99999. To find out how many there are, I can subtract 9999 from 99999, but wait, actually, it's simpler: the smallest five-digit number is 10000, and the largest is 99999. So the total count is 99999 - 10000 + 1. Let me compute that: 99999 - 10000 is 89999, plus 1 is 90000. So there are 90,000 five-digit numbers in total.Alright, now I need to find two quantities:1. The number of five-digit numbers not divisible by 5.2. The number of five-digit numbers where the first and second digits from the left are not 5.Then, I can compare these two quantities to see which is larger.Starting with the first one: numbers not divisible by 5. I know that a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. So, to find how many five-digit numbers are not divisible by 5, I can subtract the number of five-digit numbers divisible by 5 from the total.Let me compute the number of five-digit numbers divisible by 5. For a number to be divisible by 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5. So, the last digit has 2 choices. The first digit can't be 0, so it has 9 choices (1-9). The middle three digits (second, third, and fourth) can be anything from 0-9, so each has 10 choices.So, the number of five-digit numbers divisible by 5 is 9 (first digit) * 10 (second digit) * 10 (third digit) * 10 (fourth digit) * 2 (fifth digit). Let me calculate that: 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 2 = 9 * 1000 * 2 = 9 * 2000 = 18,000.Therefore, the number of five-digit numbers not divisible by 5 is the total minus this, which is 90,000 - 18,000 = 72,000.Okay, so that's 72,000 numbers not divisible by 5.Now, moving on to the second part: five-digit numbers where the first and second digits from the left are not 5. Let me parse this. The first digit is the ten-thousands place, and the second digit is the thousands place. So, we need both of these digits to not be 5.Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. For the first digit (ten-thousands place), it can't be 0 or 5. So, normally, it has 9 choices (1-9), but excluding 5, so 8 choices. For the second digit (thousands place), it can't be 5. It can be 0-9 except 5, so 9 choices. The other three digits (hundreds, tens, and units places) can be anything, so each has 10 choices.So, the number of such numbers is 8 (first digit) * 9 (second digit) * 10 (third digit) * 10 (fourth digit) * 10 (fifth digit). Let me compute that: 8 * 9 = 72, and 72 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 72 * 1000 = 72,000.Wait, that's the same as the number of numbers not divisible by 5. Hmm, so both are 72,000? So, they are equal in number?But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit coincidental.First, for numbers not divisible by 5: total five-digit numbers is 90,000. Numbers divisible by 5: 18,000. So, 90,000 - 18,000 = 72,000. That seems correct.For numbers where first and second digits are not 5: first digit has 8 choices (1-9 excluding 5), second digit has 9 choices (0-9 excluding 5), and the rest three digits have 10 each. So, 8 * 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 72,000. That also seems correct.So, both sets have 72,000 numbers. Therefore, they are equally numerous.Wait, but let me think again. Is there an overlap or something I'm missing? Because sometimes when you have two different conditions, they might overlap or not, but in this case, the counts are the same. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I should think of it another way. Let's see, for the first condition, numbers not divisible by 5: this affects the last digit. For the second condition, it affects the first and second digits. So, they are different constraints, but in this case, the number of numbers satisfying each condition is the same.So, is the answer that they are equally numerous? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the counting.Wait, let me think about the second condition again. The first digit cannot be 5, so it's 1-9 excluding 5, which is 8 choices. The second digit cannot be 5, so it's 0-9 excluding 5, which is 9 choices. The other digits are free. So, 8 * 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 is indeed 72,000.And for the first condition, numbers not divisible by 5: since the last digit can't be 0 or 5, so 8 choices for the last digit (1-9 excluding 5). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, actually, the last digit can be 0-9 except 0 and 5, so 8 choices? Wait, no, wait. If a number is not divisible by 5, the last digit can be 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. So, that's 8 choices. So, the number of five-digit numbers not divisible by 5 is 9 (first digit) * 10 (second digit) * 10 (third digit) * 10 (fourth digit) * 8 (fifth digit). So, 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 8 = 72,000.Wait, so that's another way to compute it, and it's the same result. So, both conditions result in 72,000 numbers.Therefore, they are equally numerous.But wait, hold on, let me confirm once more. For the first condition, numbers not divisible by 5: last digit can't be 0 or 5, so 8 choices. So, total is 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 8 = 72,000.For the second condition, first digit can't be 5: 8 choices, second digit can't be 5: 9 choices, rest are free: 10 each. So, 8 * 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 72,000.Yes, so both are 72,000. So, they are equally numerous.Hmm, interesting. So, the answer is that they are equally numerous.But wait, let me think about whether the two sets could overlap or not. For example, some numbers might satisfy both conditions, but the counts are still the same. So, regardless of overlap, the counts are the same, so they are equally numerous.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as both conditions are removing the same number of possibilities, but in different places. So, in one case, you're restricting the last digit, in the other, you're restricting the first two digits.But in both cases, the number of restrictions leads to the same reduction in the total count, hence the same number of remaining numbers.Therefore, I think the conclusion is that both sets are equally numerous, each containing 72,000 numbers.**Final Answer**Both sets of five-digit numbers are equally numerous, so the answer is boxed{72000} for each. However, since the question asks which is more numerous, and they are equal, the final answer is that they are the same. But since the problem might expect a comparison, perhaps stating they are equal. But looking back, the original question is: \\"Which five-digit numbers are more numerous: those that are not divisible by 5 or those whose first and second digits from the left are not 5?\\"So, since both are 72,000, they are equally numerous. So, the answer is neither is more numerous; they are the same. But in the format requested, I think the answer is they are equal, but since the problem is in Chinese, maybe the translation is slightly different. But in any case, the numerical answer is 72,000 for both, so they are equal.But the problem says \\"more numerous\\", so if they are equal, neither is more numerous. But perhaps the answer expects to say they are equal. But the instructions say to put the final answer within boxed{}, so maybe just stating the count? But the question is asking which is more numerous, so perhaps the answer is that they are equally numerous, but in the box, maybe write both counts? Hmm.Wait, the original question is in Chinese, but the translation is: \\"Which five-digit numbers are more numerous: those that are not divisible by 5 or those whose first and second digits from the left are not 5?\\"So, the answer is that they are equally numerous, each with 72,000 numbers. So, perhaps the answer is that they are equal, but since the question is asking which is more numerous, and they are equal, the answer is neither, they are the same. But in terms of the numerical answer, both are 72,000.But perhaps the problem expects to write the counts, but since they are equal, maybe just stating 72,000. But the user instruction is to put the final answer within boxed{}, so perhaps boxed{72000}.But wait, the question is asking which is more numerous, so if they are equal, perhaps the answer is neither, but in the box, I can't write that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that both are 72,000, so they are equal.But looking back, in the initial problem statement, it's asking which is more numerous, so perhaps the answer is that they are equally numerous, but since the user wants the final answer in a box, perhaps just stating the count, which is 72,000 for both.Alternatively, maybe the answer is that both are equally numerous, but since the system requires a box, perhaps writing boxed{72000} as the count for each, implying they are equal.But I think the correct way is to state that both sets have the same number of elements, which is 72,000. So, the answer is that they are equally numerous, each with 72,000 numbers. So, in the box, I can write boxed{72000} to indicate the count for each, showing they are equal.**Final Answer**boxed{72000}"},{"question":"Given that set A satisfies the condition: when p in A, there is always frac{-1}{p+1} in A (p neq 0 and p neq -1), and it is known that 2 in A, what is the minimum number of subsets of set A?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about set A. The condition is that if an element p is in A, then -1/(p + 1) must also be in A, as long as p isn't 0 or -1. They also told me that 2 is in A. I need to find the minimum number of subsets of set A. Hmm, wait, subsets? Or maybe elements? Because the question says \\"the minimum number of subsets of set A,\\" but that might be a translation issue. Maybe it's asking for the minimum number of elements in set A? Let me think.Alright, let's go with the minimum number of elements because subsets would be too broad—any set has 2^n subsets, so that might not make sense here. So, I think it's asking for the minimum number of elements in set A given the condition.So, starting with 2 in A. Then, according to the condition, if 2 is in A, then -1/(2 + 1) must also be in A. Let's compute that: -1/(2 + 1) = -1/3. So, -1/3 is in A.Now, since -1/3 is in A, we have to apply the condition again. So, p = -1/3. Then, -1/(p + 1) would be -1/(-1/3 + 1). Let's compute that denominator: -1/3 + 1 is 2/3. So, -1 divided by 2/3 is -3/2. Therefore, -3/2 must be in A.Now, let's take p = -3/2. Applying the condition again, we get -1/(p + 1). So, p + 1 is -3/2 + 1 = -1/2. Then, -1 divided by (-1/2) is 2. So, 2 is in A.Wait a second, we started with 2, got -1/3, then -3/2, and then back to 2. So, that forms a cycle: 2 → -1/3 → -3/2 → 2. So, these three elements cycle back to each other.Therefore, if we start with 2, we have to include -1/3 and -3/2 as well. So, the minimal set A must contain at least these three elements: 2, -1/3, and -3/2.Is there any other element that needs to be included? Let's check each of these elements:- For 2: we already included -1/3.- For -1/3: we included -3/2.- For -3/2: we included 2.So, all the required elements are included in this cycle. Therefore, the minimal set A has three elements.Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any possibility that another element is required? For example, if we take p = -1/3, we get -3/2, which is already in the set. Similarly, for p = -3/2, we get back to 2. So, no new elements are introduced beyond these three.Therefore, the minimal number of elements in set A is 3. So, the minimum number of subsets would be... Wait, hold on, the question says \\"the minimum number of subsets of set A.\\" Hmm, that's confusing because subsets are different from elements. If A has 3 elements, the number of subsets is 2^3 = 8. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem mentions \\"subsets of set A,\\" not \\"elements.\\"Wait, maybe the question is asking for the number of elements, but mistranslated as subsets. Because if it's asking for the number of subsets, then it's 8, but that doesn't seem to relate to the condition given. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the number of elements, which is 3.Wait, let me read the problem again: \\"what is the minimum number of subsets of set A?\\" Hmm, maybe it's a translation issue, and it's supposed to be \\"the minimum number of elements in set A.\\" Because otherwise, the number of subsets is always 2^n, which is 8 if n=3, but that doesn't make much sense in the context of the problem.Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the number of distinct subsets generated by the condition? But that also seems unclear.Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of elements in the minimal set A, which is 3, so the minimal number of elements is 3. Therefore, the minimal number of subsets would be 8, but that seems off. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the number of elements, which is 3.Wait, let me check the original problem again: \\"what is the minimum number of subsets of set A?\\" Hmm, maybe in Chinese, the term could be ambiguous between elements and subsets. But in English, subsets are different from elements. So, if it's asking for the number of subsets, then it's 2^3=8. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem is presented as a challenge.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of elements, so the minimal size of A is 3. So, maybe the answer is 3. But the question says \\"subsets,\\" so I'm confused.Wait, let me think again. The problem says: \\"when p ∈ A, there is always -1/(p + 1) ∈ A (p ≠ 0 and p ≠ -1), and it is known that 2 ∈ A, what is the minimum number of subsets of set A?\\"Wait, maybe it's a translation issue, and it's supposed to be \\"the minimum number of elements in set A.\\" Because otherwise, if it's subsets, it's 8, which is too easy.Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the number of elements in the minimal set A, which is 3. So, maybe the answer is 3, but the question says subsets. Hmm.Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the number of elements, but mistranslated as subsets. So, perhaps the answer is 3. Alternatively, if it's subsets, then 8.Wait, let me think about the problem again. If A must contain 2, -1/3, and -3/2, then the minimal set A has 3 elements. So, the minimal number of elements is 3. Therefore, the minimal number of subsets would be 8, but that seems not meaningful.Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of elements, so 3. Maybe the translation is off, and it's supposed to be \\"elements\\" instead of \\"subsets.\\"Given that, I think the answer is 3. So, the minimal set A has 3 elements: 2, -1/3, and -3/2.Therefore, the minimum number of elements is 3, so the answer is 3.But wait, the question says \\"subsets.\\" Hmm. Maybe it's a different interpretation. Maybe it's asking for the number of distinct subsets generated by the condition? But that doesn't make much sense because subsets are any combination of elements.Alternatively, maybe it's a misstatement, and it's asking for the number of elements, which is 3. So, I think the answer is 3.**Final Answer**The minimum number of elements in set ( A ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Find the cosine of the angle between vectors overrightarrow{A B} and overrightarrow{A C}.A(3, 3, -1), B(5, 1, -2), C(4, 1, 1)","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the cosine of the angle between vectors AB and AC. The points given are A(3, 3, -1), B(5, 1, -2), and C(4, 1, 1). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that to find the angle between two vectors, I can use the dot product formula. The formula is:cosθ = (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|)So, I need to find the vectors AB and AC first. Let me recall how to find vectors between two points. The vector from point A to point B is found by subtracting the coordinates of A from B. Similarly, the vector from A to C is found by subtracting A's coordinates from C's.Let me write that down.Vector AB = B - A = (5 - 3, 1 - 3, -2 - (-1)) = (2, -2, -1)Vector AC = C - A = (4 - 3, 1 - 3, 1 - (-1)) = (1, -2, 2)Okay, so AB is (2, -2, -1) and AC is (1, -2, 2). Now, I need to compute the dot product of AB and AC.The dot product is calculated by multiplying corresponding components and then adding them up. So,AB · AC = (2)(1) + (-2)(-2) + (-1)(2) = 2 + 4 - 2 = 4Wait, let me double-check that:First component: 2 * 1 = 2Second component: -2 * -2 = 4Third component: -1 * 2 = -2Adding them together: 2 + 4 - 2 = 4. Yeah, that seems right.Next, I need to find the magnitudes of AB and AC.The magnitude of a vector (x, y, z) is sqrt(x² + y² + z²).Let's compute |AB| first.|AB| = sqrt(2² + (-2)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(4 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(9) = 3Okay, that's straightforward.Now, |AC|:|AC| = sqrt(1² + (-2)² + 2²) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 4) = sqrt(9) = 3Hmm, both vectors have a magnitude of 3. That's interesting.So now, plugging these into the cosine formula:cosθ = (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|) = 4 / (3 * 3) = 4 / 9Wait, so cosθ is 4/9? That seems a bit low, but let me verify.Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, vectors AB and AC:AB = (5-3, 1-3, -2 - (-1)) = (2, -2, -1). Correct.AC = (4-3, 1-3, 1 - (-1)) = (1, -2, 2). Correct.Dot product AB · AC:2*1 + (-2)*(-2) + (-1)*2 = 2 + 4 - 2 = 4. Correct.Magnitudes:|AB| = sqrt(2² + (-2)² + (-1)²) = sqrt(4 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(9) = 3. Correct.|AC| = sqrt(1² + (-2)² + 2²) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 4) = sqrt(9) = 3. Correct.So, cosθ = 4 / (3*3) = 4/9. That seems correct.Wait, 4/9 is approximately 0.444, which is a valid cosine value since it's between -1 and 1. So, the angle θ would be arccos(4/9). But the question just asks for the cosine, so 4/9 is the answer.I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Let me just recap:1. Found vectors AB and AC by subtracting coordinates.2. Calculated the dot product of AB and AC.3. Found the magnitudes of AB and AC.4. Applied the cosine formula.Everything checks out. I think 4/9 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The cosine of the angle between vectors overrightarrow{A B} and overrightarrow{A C} is boxed{dfrac{4}{9}}."},{"question":"Simplify: dfrac{sin(dfrac{pi}{2}+alpha)sin(pi+alpha)tan(3pi+alpha)}{cos(dfrac{3pi}{2}+alpha)sin(-alpha)}= ______ .","answer":"Okay, so I have this trigonometric expression to simplify: [frac{sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight) sin(pi + alpha) tan(3pi + alpha)}{cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight) sin(-alpha)}]Hmm, trigonometric identities. I remember there are some co-function and shift identities that might help here. Let me try to break it down term by term.Starting with the numerator:1. **First term:** (sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight)). I think this is a co-function identity. Isn't (sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight)) equal to (cos alpha)? Let me verify. Yes, because sine of an angle plus pi/2 is cosine of that angle. So, that term simplifies to (cos alpha).2. **Second term:** (sin(pi + alpha)). This is a sine function with an angle shifted by pi. I recall that (sin(pi + alpha) = -sin alpha). Because sine has a period of 2pi, and adding pi flips the sign. So, this term becomes (-sin alpha).3. **Third term:** (tan(3pi + alpha)). Tangent has a period of pi, so adding 3pi is the same as adding pi three times. Since tan has a period of pi, (tan(3pi + alpha) = tan(alpha)). But wait, tan is also positive in the third quadrant, right? Because tan is sin over cos, and both sin and cos are negative in the third quadrant, so tan is positive. So, it's just (tan alpha).So, putting the numerator together:[cos alpha times (-sin alpha) times tan alpha]Which is:[- cos alpha sin alpha tan alpha]Now, let's look at the denominator:1. **First term:** (cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight)). Cosine shifted by 3pi/2. I think this can be simplified using co-function or shift identities. Let me recall, (cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight)) is equal to (sin alpha). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Cosine of 3pi/2 is 0, and the shift by alpha. Alternatively, using the identity (cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight) = sin alpha). Hmm, not sure. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, using the identity (cosleft(theta + frac{3pi}{2}right) = sin theta), but I might be mixing things up. Let me use the cosine addition formula:[cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight) = cosleft(frac{3pi}{2}right)cos alpha - sinleft(frac{3pi}{2}right)sin alpha]We know that (cosleft(frac{3pi}{2}right) = 0) and (sinleft(frac{3pi}{2}right) = -1). So substituting:[0 times cos alpha - (-1) times sin alpha = sin alpha]So, (cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight) = sin alpha). Okay, got that.2. **Second term:** (sin(-alpha)). Sine is an odd function, so (sin(-alpha) = -sin alpha).So, the denominator becomes:[sin alpha times (-sin alpha) = -sin^2 alpha]Now, putting numerator and denominator together:Numerator: (- cos alpha sin alpha tan alpha)Denominator: (-sin^2 alpha)So, the entire expression is:[frac{- cos alpha sin alpha tan alpha}{- sin^2 alpha}]The negatives in numerator and denominator cancel out, so we have:[frac{cos alpha sin alpha tan alpha}{sin^2 alpha}]Simplify numerator and denominator:First, (tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}). Let me substitute that in:[frac{cos alpha sin alpha times frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}}{sin^2 alpha}]Simplify numerator:The (cos alpha) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so we have:[frac{sin alpha times sin alpha}{sin^2 alpha}]Which is:[frac{sin^2 alpha}{sin^2 alpha} = 1]Wait, so the entire expression simplifies to 1? That seems too straightforward. Let me double-check each step.Starting with the numerator:1. (sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight) = cos alpha) – correct.2. (sin(pi + alpha) = -sin alpha) – correct.3. (tan(3pi + alpha) = tan alpha) – correct, since tan has period pi.So numerator: (cos alpha times (-sin alpha) times tan alpha = - cos alpha sin alpha tan alpha).Denominator:1. (cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight) = sin alpha) – correct.2. (sin(-alpha) = -sin alpha) – correct.So denominator: (sin alpha times (-sin alpha) = -sin^2 alpha).Putting together: (frac{- cos alpha sin alpha tan alpha}{- sin^2 alpha}).The negatives cancel, so (frac{cos alpha sin alpha tan alpha}{sin^2 alpha}).Replace tan with sin/cos: (frac{cos alpha sin alpha times frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}}{sin^2 alpha}).Simplify numerator: (sin alpha times sin alpha = sin^2 alpha).Denominator: (sin^2 alpha).So (frac{sin^2 alpha}{sin^2 alpha} = 1).Yes, that seems correct. So the entire expression simplifies to 1.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a step where I might have made a mistake? For example, in the numerator, when I had (tan(3pi + alpha)), is that really (tan alpha)?Yes, because tan has a period of pi, so adding 3pi is the same as adding pi three times, which doesn't change the value. So, (tan(3pi + alpha) = tan alpha). That's correct.And in the denominator, (cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight)). I used the addition formula and found it equal to (sin alpha). Let me verify that with another approach.Alternatively, (frac{3pi}{2}) is 270 degrees. So, (cos(270^circ + alpha)). Cosine of 270 degrees is 0, and the shift by alpha. Alternatively, using the unit circle, 270 degrees plus alpha is in the fourth quadrant. The cosine of that is equal to the sine of alpha, but with a sign. Wait, actually, (cos(270^circ + alpha) = sin alpha). Let me recall the exact identity.Yes, (cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + alpharight) = sin alpha). Because cosine of 3pi/2 is 0, sine of 3pi/2 is -1, so using the identity:[cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B]So, (cos(3pi/2 + alpha) = cos(3pi/2)cos alpha - sin(3pi/2)sin alpha = 0 times cos alpha - (-1) times sin alpha = sin alpha). So that's correct.Similarly, (sin(-alpha) = -sin alpha). That's correct.So, all steps seem correct, and the simplification leads to 1.Therefore, the expression simplifies to 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"In a certain hyperbola, the center is at (2,0), one focus is at (2,6), and one vertex is at (2,-3).  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as[frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1.]Find h + k + a + b.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the equation of a hyperbola given some specific points. The center is at (2,0), one focus is at (2,6), and one vertex is at (2,-3). The equation is given in the form [frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1.] I need to find h, k, a, and b, and then add them together.First, let me recall what each part of the hyperbola equation represents. The general form is [frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1,] which means it's a hyperbola that opens up and down. The center of the hyperbola is at (h, k). In this problem, the center is given as (2,0), so that means h = 2 and k = 0. So, I can already note that h = 2 and k = 0.Next, I need to find a and b. Let's start with a because I have information about the vertex. The vertex is at (2, -3). Since the hyperbola opens up and down, the vertices are located a distance of 'a' from the center along the y-axis. The center is at (2,0), and the vertex is at (2, -3). So, the distance from the center to the vertex is |0 - (-3)| = 3 units. Therefore, a = 3.Now, I need to find b. To find b, I remember that in a hyperbola, the relationship between a, b, and c (the distance from the center to each focus) is given by the equation c² = a² + b². I know that c is the distance from the center to the focus. The center is at (2,0), and one focus is at (2,6). So, the distance from the center to the focus is |0 - 6| = 6 units. Therefore, c = 6.Now, I can plug in the known values into the equation c² = a² + b². Let's do that step by step.First, compute c²: 6² = 36.Next, compute a²: 3² = 9.So, plugging into the equation: 36 = 9 + b².Now, solve for b²: subtract 9 from both sides, 36 - 9 = b², so 27 = b².Therefore, b = sqrt(27). Simplify sqrt(27): sqrt(9*3) = 3*sqrt(3). So, b = 3√3.Wait, but in the equation, it's b², so actually, in the equation, we have b² = 27, so we don't need to take the square root unless asked for b. But in the problem, we need to find a and b, so I think we need to give the value of b as sqrt(27) or 3√3.But let me double-check. The equation is [frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1.] So, in this case, a² is 9 and b² is 27. So, the equation would be [frac{(y - 0)^2}{9} - frac{(x - 2)^2}{27} = 1.] That seems correct.But let me make sure I didn't mix up a and c. The distance from the center to the vertex is a, which is 3, and the distance from the center to the focus is c, which is 6. Then, using c² = a² + b², so 36 = 9 + b², which gives b² = 27. That seems right.So, summarizing:h = 2k = 0a = 3b = 3√3Wait, but the problem says \\"Find h + k + a + b.\\" So, h is 2, k is 0, a is 3, and b is 3√3. So, adding them together: 2 + 0 + 3 + 3√3.But hold on, the problem didn't specify whether to rationalize or anything, but 3√3 is an exact value, so that should be fine.But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the hyperbola.Given the center is at (2,0), and the vertex is at (2,-3). So, since the x-coordinate is the same, it's a vertical hyperbola, which is why the equation is in terms of (y - k)^2 over a² minus the other term. So, that part is correct.Also, the focus is at (2,6), which is above the center, so that also makes sense for a vertical hyperbola.So, all the steps seem correct.Therefore, h = 2, k = 0, a = 3, b = 3√3.Adding them together: 2 + 0 + 3 + 3√3.Wait, but 2 + 0 is 2, plus 3 is 5, plus 3√3. So, the total is 5 + 3√3.But let me check if the question is asking for h + k + a + b, which are all constants. So, h is 2, k is 0, a is 3, and b is 3√3. So, yes, adding them together: 2 + 0 + 3 + 3√3 = 5 + 3√3.But wait, hold on, in the equation, b² is 27, so b is sqrt(27) which is 3√3, so that's correct.Alternatively, is there a possibility that I mixed up a and c? Let me think.Wait, in hyperbola, for vertical hyperbola, the standard form is [frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1,] with a being the distance from center to vertex, and c being the distance from center to focus, and c² = a² + b².So, yes, that's correct.So, a = 3, c = 6, so b² = c² - a² = 36 - 9 = 27, so b = 3√3.So, all correct.Therefore, h + k + a + b = 2 + 0 + 3 + 3√3 = 5 + 3√3.But let me check if the problem expects a numerical value or an exact form. Since 3√3 is an exact value, and the problem didn't specify, I think 5 + 3√3 is the answer.But wait, let me double-check all the steps once more.Center at (2,0): correct.Vertex at (2, -3): distance from center is 3, so a = 3: correct.Focus at (2,6): distance from center is 6, so c = 6: correct.Then, c² = a² + b²: 36 = 9 + b²: correct, so b² = 27, b = 3√3: correct.So, h = 2, k = 0, a = 3, b = 3√3.Thus, h + k + a + b = 2 + 0 + 3 + 3√3 = 5 + 3√3.So, I think that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me write down the equation of the hyperbola with these values and see if it makes sense.Equation: [frac{(y - 0)^2}{9} - frac{(x - 2)^2}{27} = 1.]So, that's [frac{y^2}{9} - frac{(x - 2)^2}{27} = 1.]Let me check if the vertex is at (2, -3). Plugging y = -3, x = 2 into the equation:[frac{(-3)^2}{9} - frac{(2 - 2)^2}{27} = frac{9}{9} - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1.] So, that's correct.Similarly, the focus is at (2,6). For hyperbola, the foci are located at (h, k ± c). Since it's a vertical hyperbola, the foci are along the y-axis. So, center is (2,0), so foci are at (2, 0 + 6) and (2, 0 - 6), which are (2,6) and (2,-6). So, given that one focus is at (2,6), that's correct.Similarly, the vertices are at (2, 0 ± a), so (2, 0 + 3) and (2, 0 - 3), which are (2,3) and (2,-3). The problem mentions one vertex is at (2,-3), so that's correct.Therefore, all points check out.Thus, the values are correct, so h + k + a + b = 5 + 3√3.But wait, the problem says \\"Find h + k + a + b.\\" So, is it 5 + 3√3? Or is there a different way to express this?Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the direction of the hyperbola.Wait, the center is at (2,0), vertex is at (2,-3). So, the hyperbola opens downward and upward? Because the vertex is below the center.Wait, no, actually, in the standard form, the hyperbola opens in the direction of the positive term. So, since it's (y - k)^2 over a² minus the other term, it opens up and down. So, the vertex at (2,-3) is below the center, so it's a downward opening vertex, but the hyperbola still opens both up and down.So, the hyperbola has two branches, one opening upwards and one downwards, with the center at (2,0). The vertex at (2,-3) is the lower vertex, and the other vertex would be at (2,3). Similarly, the foci are at (2,6) and (2,-6). So, that's correct.Therefore, the equation is correct, and the values of h, k, a, and b are correct.So, adding them together: h = 2, k = 0, a = 3, b = 3√3. So, 2 + 0 + 3 + 3√3 = 5 + 3√3.Therefore, the answer is 5 + 3√3.But just to make sure, let me compute 5 + 3√3 numerically to see if it's approximately 5 + 5.196 = approximately 10.196. But since the problem didn't specify, I think the exact form is fine.So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 5 + 3√3.**Final Answer**boxed{5 + 3sqrt{3}}"},{"question":"Let ( a_{n} = 2^{n}, b^{n} = n (n = 1, 2, 3, ldots) ), ( A_{n} ) and ( B_{n} ) be the sums of the sequences ( left{a_{n}right} ) and ( left{b_{n}right} ), respectively, over the first ( n ) terms.

Let me try to break it down step by step.First, let me parse the given information. We have two sequences:- ( a_n = 2^n ) for ( n = 1, 2, 3, ldots )- ( b^n = n ) for ( n = 1, 2, 3, ldots )Wait, hold on. The notation for ( b^n ) is a bit confusing. Is that ( b_n = n )? Because usually, sequences are denoted with subscripts, not exponents. So I think it's a typo or misprint, and they meant ( b_n = n ). That makes more sense because otherwise, ( b^n ) would be a bit unusual as a sequence definition.So, assuming ( b_n = n ), that simplifies things.Next, ( A_n ) and ( B_n ) are the sums of the sequences {a_n} and {b_n} over the first n terms. So:- ( A_n = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n = 2^1 + 2^2 + ldots + 2^n )- ( B_n = b_1 + b_2 + ldots + b_n = 1 + 2 + ldots + n )Okay, so ( A_n ) is the sum of a geometric series, and ( B_n ) is the sum of the first n natural numbers.Now, the problem defines ( c_n = a_n B_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n ). So, I need to compute this expression for each n and then sum the first 10 terms of {c_n}.Let me write down the formula again:( c_n = a_n B_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n )Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression a bit. Let's see:( c_n = a_n B_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n = a_n (B_n - b_n) + b_n A_n )But not sure if that helps yet. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out ( a_n ) and ( b_n ):Wait, let me compute each term separately.First, let's find expressions for ( A_n ) and ( B_n ).Starting with ( A_n ):( A_n = 2^1 + 2^2 + ldots + 2^n )This is a geometric series with first term 2 and common ratio 2. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by:( S_n = a frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} )Where a is the first term, r is the common ratio. So here, a = 2, r = 2, so:( A_n = 2 times frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} = 2(2^n - 1) = 2^{n+1} - 2 )Got that. So ( A_n = 2^{n+1} - 2 )Now, ( B_n ) is the sum of the first n natural numbers:( B_n = 1 + 2 + ldots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} )That's a standard formula. So ( B_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} )Alright, now we have expressions for ( A_n ) and ( B_n ). Let's plug them into the expression for ( c_n ).Given:( c_n = a_n B_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n )We know:- ( a_n = 2^n )- ( b_n = n )- ( A_n = 2^{n+1} - 2 )- ( B_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} )So let's substitute these into the expression for ( c_n ):First term: ( a_n B_n = 2^n times frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 2^{n-1} n(n+1) )Second term: ( b_n A_n = n times (2^{n+1} - 2) = n times 2^{n+1} - 2n )Third term: ( a_n b_n = 2^n times n = n 2^n )So putting it all together:( c_n = 2^{n-1} n(n+1) + (n 2^{n+1} - 2n) - n 2^n )Let me simplify each term step by step.First term: ( 2^{n-1} n(n+1) )Second term: ( n 2^{n+1} - 2n )Third term: ( -n 2^n )So let's write all terms:1. ( 2^{n-1} n(n+1) )2. ( + n 2^{n+1} )3. ( - 2n )4. ( - n 2^n )Now, let's try to combine like terms.First, let's handle the terms with ( 2^{n+1} ):Looking at term 2: ( n 2^{n+1} )And term 1: ( 2^{n-1} n(n+1) )Hmm, maybe it's better to express all terms with the same exponent.Note that ( 2^{n-1} = frac{1}{2} 2^n ), and ( 2^{n+1} = 2 times 2^n ). So perhaps express all in terms of ( 2^n ):Term 1: ( 2^{n-1} n(n+1) = frac{1}{2} 2^n n(n+1) )Term 2: ( n 2^{n+1} = 2 n 2^n )Term 4: ( -n 2^n )So now, rewrite all terms:1. ( frac{1}{2} 2^n n(n+1) )2. ( + 2 n 2^n )3. ( - 2n )4. ( - n 2^n )Now, let's factor out ( 2^n ) from the first, second, and fourth terms:( 2^n left( frac{1}{2} n(n+1) + 2n - n right) - 2n )Simplify inside the brackets:First, compute ( frac{1}{2} n(n+1) + 2n - n )Let me compute each part:- ( frac{1}{2} n(n+1) = frac{n^2 + n}{2} )- ( 2n - n = n )So adding them together:( frac{n^2 + n}{2} + n = frac{n^2 + n + 2n}{2} = frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} )So now, the expression becomes:( 2^n times frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} - 2n )Simplify ( 2^n times frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} ):That's equal to ( 2^{n - 1} (n^2 + 3n) )So now, ( c_n = 2^{n - 1} (n^2 + 3n) - 2n )Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Let me write that as:( c_n = 2^{n - 1} (n^2 + 3n) - 2n )Alternatively, factor out n:( c_n = n (2^{n - 1} (n + 3) - 2) )But not sure if that helps.Alternatively, let me compute ( 2^{n - 1} (n^2 + 3n) ):That's ( frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} 2^n )So, ( c_n = frac{n^2 + 3n}{2} 2^n - 2n )Alternatively, ( c_n = (n^2 + 3n) 2^{n - 1} - 2n )Hmm, perhaps we can write this as:( c_n = (n^2 + 3n - 4) 2^{n - 1} )Wait, let me check:Wait, ( (n^2 + 3n) 2^{n - 1} - 2n = (n^2 + 3n - 4) 2^{n - 1} + something ). Hmm, maybe not.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to leave it as ( c_n = 2^{n - 1} (n^2 + 3n) - 2n ) for now.But maybe instead of trying to simplify ( c_n ), I can compute the sum of the first 10 terms directly.Wait, the problem asks for the sum of the first 10 terms of {c_n}, so ( S = c_1 + c_2 + ldots + c_{10} )So perhaps instead of trying to find a closed-form expression for ( c_n ), I can compute each ( c_n ) for n from 1 to 10 and sum them up.But that might be tedious, but maybe manageable.Alternatively, perhaps I can find a telescoping series or some pattern when summing ( c_n ).Wait, let's think about the expression for ( c_n ):( c_n = a_n B_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n )Which is ( c_n = a_n (B_n - b_n) + b_n A_n )But since ( B_n = b_1 + b_2 + ldots + b_n ), so ( B_n - b_n = B_{n-1} )Similarly, ( A_n = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n ), so ( A_n = A_{n-1} + a_n )Wait, so substituting back:( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_n )Hmm, maybe that's a better way to express it.So, ( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_n )So, if we think about the sum ( S = sum_{n=1}^{10} c_n = sum_{n=1}^{10} [a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_n] )Which can be split into two sums:( S = sum_{n=1}^{10} a_n B_{n-1} + sum_{n=1}^{10} b_n A_n )Now, let's analyze each sum separately.First sum: ( S1 = sum_{n=1}^{10} a_n B_{n-1} )Note that when n=1, ( B_{0} ) is the sum of the first 0 terms, which is 0. So the first term is ( a_1 times 0 = 0 ). So effectively, ( S1 = sum_{n=2}^{10} a_n B_{n-1} )Similarly, the second sum: ( S2 = sum_{n=1}^{10} b_n A_n )So, ( S = S1 + S2 = sum_{n=2}^{10} a_n B_{n-1} + sum_{n=1}^{10} b_n A_n )Hmm, perhaps we can find a telescoping effect here. Let me see.Wait, let's consider the term ( a_n B_{n-1} ) and ( b_n A_n ). Maybe these can be combined or related to differences of some other terms.Alternatively, let's think about the product ( A_n B_n ). Maybe we can relate ( c_n ) to the difference ( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} ) or something similar.Wait, let's compute ( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} ):( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} = (A_{n-1} + a_n)(B_{n-1} + b_n) - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} )Expanding the product:( A_{n-1} B_{n-1} + A_{n-1} b_n + a_n B_{n-1} + a_n b_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} )Simplify:( A_{n-1} b_n + a_n B_{n-1} + a_n b_n )So, ( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} = A_{n-1} b_n + a_n B_{n-1} + a_n b_n )But wait, our expression for ( c_n ) is:( c_n = a_n B_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n )Which is similar but not exactly the same.Wait, let's see:From the above, we have:( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} = A_{n-1} b_n + a_n B_{n-1} + a_n b_n )But ( c_n = a_n B_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n )So, let's see if we can relate ( c_n ) to ( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} ).Wait, let's compute ( c_n ):( c_n = a_n B_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n )But ( B_n = B_{n-1} + b_n ), so:( c_n = a_n (B_{n-1} + b_n) + b_n A_n - a_n b_n )Expanding:( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + a_n b_n + b_n A_n - a_n b_n )Simplify:( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_n )Which is exactly the expression we had earlier. So, ( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_n )But from the earlier expansion, we have:( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} = A_{n-1} b_n + a_n B_{n-1} + a_n b_n )But ( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_n )Wait, so ( c_n = (A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} - a_n b_n) + b_n A_n )Wait, maybe that's not helpful.Wait, let me think differently.We have:( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_n )But ( A_n = A_{n-1} + a_n ), so:( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n (A_{n-1} + a_n) )Expanding:( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_{n-1} + b_n a_n )Which is:( c_n = (a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_{n-1}) + a_n b_n )But from the earlier expansion, ( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} = A_{n-1} b_n + a_n B_{n-1} + a_n b_n )Which is exactly ( c_n + a_n b_n = A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} + a_n b_n ). Hmm, not sure.Wait, actually, ( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} = A_{n-1} b_n + a_n B_{n-1} + a_n b_n )But ( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_n )So, ( c_n = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n (A_{n-1} + a_n) = a_n B_{n-1} + b_n A_{n-1} + a_n b_n )Which is exactly equal to ( A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} ). So, ( c_n = A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} )Wait, that's a key insight!So, ( c_n = A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} )Therefore, the sum ( S = sum_{n=1}^{10} c_n = sum_{n=1}^{10} (A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1}) )This is a telescoping series because when we expand the sum, most terms will cancel out.Let me write out the terms:When n=1: ( A_1 B_1 - A_0 B_0 )When n=2: ( A_2 B_2 - A_1 B_1 )When n=3: ( A_3 B_3 - A_2 B_2 )...When n=10: ( A_{10} B_{10} - A_9 B_9 )So, when we add all these up, the intermediate terms cancel:- The ( -A_1 B_1 ) from n=1 cancels with the ( +A_1 B_1 ) from n=2.- Similarly, ( -A_2 B_2 ) from n=2 cancels with the ( +A_2 B_2 ) from n=3.- This continues until the last term.So, the sum S becomes:( S = A_{10} B_{10} - A_0 B_0 )But ( A_0 ) is the sum of the first 0 terms of {a_n}, which is 0. Similarly, ( B_0 = 0 ). So, ( A_0 B_0 = 0 times 0 = 0 )Therefore, ( S = A_{10} B_{10} - 0 = A_{10} B_{10} )So, the sum of the first 10 terms of {c_n} is equal to ( A_{10} B_{10} )Wow, that simplifies things a lot!So, now I just need to compute ( A_{10} ) and ( B_{10} ), then multiply them together.Earlier, we found expressions for ( A_n ) and ( B_n ):- ( A_n = 2^{n+1} - 2 )- ( B_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} )So, let's compute ( A_{10} ):( A_{10} = 2^{10 + 1} - 2 = 2^{11} - 2 = 2048 - 2 = 2046 )And ( B_{10} ):( B_{10} = frac{10 times 11}{2} = frac{110}{2} = 55 )Therefore, ( A_{10} B_{10} = 2046 times 55 )Now, compute 2046 × 55.Let me compute that step by step.First, note that 2046 × 55 = 2046 × (50 + 5) = 2046 × 50 + 2046 × 5Compute 2046 × 50:2046 × 50 = 2046 × 5 × 10 = (2046 × 5) × 102046 × 5: 2000 × 5 = 10,000; 46 × 5 = 230; so total is 10,000 + 230 = 10,230Then, 10,230 × 10 = 102,300Now, compute 2046 × 5:2046 × 5 = 10,230 (same as above)So, adding both parts:102,300 + 10,230 = 112,530Therefore, ( A_{10} B_{10} = 112,530 )Wait, but looking at the answer choices:(A) ( 2^{10} + 53 ) = 1024 + 53 = 1077(B) ( 2^{11} + 53 ) = 2048 + 53 = 2101(C) ( 110 times (2^{9} - 1) ) = 110 × (512 - 1) = 110 × 511 = let's compute that: 110 × 500 = 55,000; 110 × 11 = 1,210; total is 55,000 + 1,210 = 56,210(D) ( 110 times (2^{10} - 1) ) = 110 × (1024 - 1) = 110 × 1023 = let's compute that:100 × 1023 = 102,30010 × 1023 = 10,230Total: 102,300 + 10,230 = 112,530So, option D is 112,530, which is exactly what I computed for ( A_{10} B_{10} ). Therefore, the sum S is equal to option D.But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 112,530 is a pretty large number, and the answer choices include some smaller numbers as well.Wait, but according to the telescoping series, the sum S is equal to ( A_{10} B_{10} ), which is 2046 × 55 = 112,530. So that's correct.Looking back at the options:(A) 1077(B) 2101(C) 56,210(D) 112,530So, D is the correct answer.But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem.Wait, the problem says \\"the sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence {c_n}\\". So, S = c1 + c2 + ... + c10.We found that S = A10 B10 = 112,530, which is option D.But let me cross-verify with another approach.Alternatively, since ( c_n = A_n B_n - A_{n-1} B_{n-1} ), then summing from n=1 to 10 gives a telescoping sum:Sum = (A1 B1 - A0 B0) + (A2 B2 - A1 B1) + ... + (A10 B10 - A9 B9) = A10 B10 - A0 B0 = A10 B10, since A0 B0 = 0.So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, the answer is D: ( 110 times (2^{10} - 1) ), which is equal to 112,530.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Create a statement that is true only for the numbers 2 and 5.","answer":"Okay, so I need to create a statement that's true only for the numbers 2 and 5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can use some mathematical properties or operations that specifically apply to 2 and 5.First, I know that 2 and 5 are both prime numbers. But wait, there are other prime numbers too, like 3, 7, 11, etc. So just saying \\"x is a prime number\\" wouldn't work because it's true for more than just 2 and 5.Maybe I can combine properties. Let's see, 2 is the only even prime number, and 5 is the only prime that ends with a 5. So perhaps I can create a statement that checks if a number is either the only even prime or the only prime ending with 5.Alternatively, I could use equations or inequalities. For example, if I can find an equation that holds true only when x is 2 or 5. Let me think about some equations.What if I use something like (x - 2)(x - 5) = 0? That equation is true only when x is 2 or 5. But I'm not sure if that's the kind of statement the question is looking for. It might be too straightforward.Wait, maybe I can use a different approach. Let's think about the sum of digits or something related to their representation. For example, 2 is the only prime number that is even, and 5 is the only prime number that is a single-digit number ending with 5. So combining these two properties could work.Another idea: using modulo operations. For instance, 2 is congruent to 0 mod 2, and 5 is congruent to 1 mod 4. But I'm not sure how to combine these into a single statement that only applies to 2 and 5.Let me try to structure it. Maybe something like: \\"x is a prime number and (x is even or x ends with 5).\\" That way, it's only true for 2 and 5 because 2 is the only even prime, and 5 is the only prime ending with 5.Wait, but does that cover all cases? Let me test it. If x is 2, it's a prime and even, so true. If x is 5, it's a prime and ends with 5, so true. What about x=3? It's a prime but not even and doesn't end with 5, so false. Similarly, x=7, same thing. So that seems to work.Alternatively, using equations: x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0. The solutions to this equation are x=2 and x=5. So the statement \\"x satisfies x² - 7x + 10 = 0\\" would be true only for 2 and 5.I think that's a solid approach. It's a mathematical equation that specifically targets those two numbers. Let me double-check by plugging in other numbers. If x=3, 9 -21 +10 = -2 ≠0. If x=4, 16-28+10= -2≠0. If x=6, 36-42+10=4≠0. So yes, only 2 and 5 satisfy that equation.Another thought: maybe using factorials or something else, but that might complicate things. The equation approach seems straightforward and effective.So, to sum up, I can create a statement that uses an equation which only holds true for x=2 and x=5. The quadratic equation x² -7x +10=0 is a good candidate because its roots are exactly 2 and 5. Therefore, the statement \\"x satisfies x² -7x +10=0\\" is true only for 2 and 5.I think that's a clear and concise way to meet the requirement. It uses a mathematical property that uniquely identifies those two numbers without including any others. I don't see any issues with this approach, so I'll go with that."},{"question":"One male student and two female students stand in a row. The number of arrangements where the two female students stand next to each other is boxed{4}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: there's one male student and two female students standing in a row. I need to find the number of arrangements where the two female students stand next to each other, and the answer is supposed to be 4. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.First, let me visualize the problem. There are three students in total: one male (let's call him M) and two females (let's call them F1 and F2). They need to stand in a row, so the total number of possible arrangements without any restrictions would be 3 factorial, which is 3! = 6. That makes sense because for three positions, the first position can be any of the three, the second position can be any of the remaining two, and the last position is the remaining one. So 3×2×1=6.But the question isn't asking for all possible arrangements; it's specifically asking for the number of arrangements where the two female students stand next to each other. So I need to figure out how many of those 6 total arrangements have F1 and F2 adjacent to each other.One approach I remember is treating the two females as a single unit when they need to be together. So instead of thinking of three separate individuals, I can think of two units: the male (M) and the female pair (FF). If I do that, how many ways can these two units be arranged?Well, if I have two units, the number of ways to arrange them is 2! = 2. So that would be FF followed by M, or M followed by FF. But wait, within the female pair, F1 and F2 can switch places, right? So for each of these two arrangements, there are two possibilities for the order of the females. So that would be 2! × 2! = 2×2=4. So that gives me 4 arrangements where the two females are next to each other.Let me list them out to make sure I'm not missing anything. The total possible arrangements are:1. M, F1, F22. M, F2, F13. F1, M, F24. F1, F2, M5. F2, M, F16. F2, F1, MNow, let's identify which of these have the two females next to each other.Looking at arrangement 1: M, F1, F2. Here, F1 and F2 are next to each other. So that's one.Arrangement 2: M, F2, F1. Similarly, F2 and F1 are next to each other. That's another.Arrangement 3: F1, M, F2. Here, F1 is first, then M, then F2. So the females are not next to each other. So this doesn't count.Arrangement 4: F1, F2, M. Here, F1 and F2 are next to each other. That's another.Arrangement 5: F2, M, F1. Again, F2 is first, then M, then F1. So the females are not next to each other. Doesn't count.Arrangement 6: F2, F1, M. Here, F2 and F1 are next to each other. That's another.So, from the list, arrangements 1, 2, 4, and 6 have the two females next to each other. That's four arrangements, which matches the earlier calculation.Wait, but let me double-check. In arrangement 3, F1 is first, M is second, and F2 is third. So F1 and F2 are separated by M, so they aren't adjacent. Similarly, arrangement 5 has F2, M, F1, so again, separated by M. So only four arrangements where the two females are next to each other.Alternatively, another way to think about it is: how many positions can the two females occupy together? In a row of three positions, the two females can be in positions 1 and 2, or positions 2 and 3. So that's two possible blocks. For each block, the two females can be arranged in 2 ways (F1 first or F2 first). Then, the male student takes the remaining position. So that would be 2 blocks × 2 arrangements per block = 4 total arrangements.Yes, that also gives 4. So both methods confirm that the number is 4.I think I'm confident now that the answer is indeed 4.**Final Answer**The number of arrangements is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Given vector m = (1, 1) and vector n = (x, 2 - 2x) are perpendicular, then x = boxed{2}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given two vectors, m and n. Vector m is (1, 1) and vector n is (x, 2 - 2x). They say these vectors are perpendicular, and I need to find the value of x. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero. The dot product is a way to multiply two vectors together, and if the result is zero, they are perpendicular. So, I should calculate the dot product of vectors m and n and set it equal to zero. That should give me an equation to solve for x.Let me write down the vectors again to make sure I have them right. Vector m is (1, 1) and vector n is (x, 2 - 2x). So, the dot product of m and n would be (1)(x) + (1)(2 - 2x). Let me compute that step by step.First component: 1 times x is x. Second component: 1 times (2 - 2x) is 2 - 2x. So, adding those together, I get x + 2 - 2x. Hmm, let me simplify that expression.Combine like terms: x - 2x is -x, and then we have +2. So, the dot product simplifies to -x + 2. Since the vectors are perpendicular, this dot product should equal zero. So, I can set up the equation:-x + 2 = 0Now, I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 2 from both sides:-x = -2Then, multiply both sides by -1 to solve for x:x = 2Wait, so x is 2? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with the dot product: (1)(x) + (1)(2 - 2x) = x + 2 - 2x. Combine like terms: x - 2x is -x, so it's -x + 2. Set equal to zero: -x + 2 = 0. Solving for x: x = 2. Yeah, that seems correct.Just to be thorough, let me plug x = 2 back into vector n and check if the dot product is indeed zero.Vector n becomes (2, 2 - 2*2) = (2, 2 - 4) = (2, -2). Vector m is (1, 1). So, the dot product is (1)(2) + (1)(-2) = 2 - 2 = 0. Perfect, that confirms it.I don't think I made any mistakes here. The process was straightforward: calculate the dot product, set it to zero, solve for x, and verify the solution. So, I'm confident that x is indeed 2.**Final Answer**The value of ( x ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"There are 100 students who want to sign up for the class \\"Introduction to Acting.\\" There are three class sections for \\"Introduction to Acting,\\" each of which will fit exactly 20 students. The 100 students, including Alex and Zhu, are put in a lottery, and 60 of them are randomly selected to fill up the classes. What is the probability that Alex and Zhu end up getting into the same section for the class?","answer":"First, I need to determine the probability that both Alex and Zhu are selected into the class. Since there are 100 students and 60 spots, the probability that Alex is selected is 60/100. Once Alex is selected, there are 59 remaining spots out of 99 students for Zhu, so the probability that Zhu is also selected is 59/99. Multiplying these probabilities gives the chance that both are selected: (60/100) * (59/99) = 177/495.Next, assuming both Alex and Zhu are selected, I need to find the probability that they are placed in the same section. There are 60 selected students and 3 sections, each holding 20 students. Once Alex is placed in a section, there are 19 remaining spots in that section out of the remaining 59 students for Zhu. Therefore, the probability that Zhu is placed in the same section as Alex is 19/59.Finally, to find the overall probability that both Alex and Zhu are selected and placed in the same section, I multiply the two probabilities: (177/495) * (19/59) = 333/2970.

Hmm, let me try to break this down.First, let me understand what exactly is being asked. I need to arrange the digits 1, 2, 3 and the symbols +, - in some order, but with the condition that no two digits are next to each other. So, digits must be separated by at least one symbol. That makes sense.Let me figure out how many total elements I have. The digits are 1, 2, 3, so that's 3 digits, and the symbols are + and -, so that's 2 symbols. So, in total, I have 5 elements to arrange. But with the restriction that no two digits can be adjacent.Wait, so if I have 3 digits, they need to be placed in such a way that there's at least one symbol between them. So, maybe I can think of arranging the symbols first and then placing the digits in the gaps between them.Yes, that seems like a common approach for these kinds of problems. So, if I arrange the symbols first, which are + and -, there are 2 symbols. The number of ways to arrange these symbols is 2! since there are 2 distinct symbols. So, 2! = 2 ways.Now, when I arrange these two symbols, they create slots where I can place the digits. Specifically, the number of slots is one more than the number of symbols. So, with 2 symbols, there are 3 slots: one before the first symbol, one between the two symbols, and one after the second symbol.So, the arrangement would look like: _ symbol _ symbol _.Each underscore represents a slot where I can place a digit. Since I have 3 digits to place and 3 slots, each slot must contain exactly one digit. That makes sense because we have the same number of digits as slots.Now, the digits are 1, 2, 3, which are distinct, so the number of ways to arrange them in the 3 slots is 3! = 6.Therefore, the total number of permutations would be the number of ways to arrange the symbols multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the digits in the slots. So, that's 2! * 3! = 2 * 6 = 12.Wait, but hold on a second. Is that all? Let me think again.We have 5 elements in total: 3 digits and 2 symbols. If we arrange the symbols first, we have 2! ways, and then place the digits in the 3 slots, which is 3! ways. So, 2! * 3! = 12. That seems correct.But let me verify by actually listing some permutations to make sure.Suppose the symbols are arranged as +, -.Then the slots are: _ + _ - _.We can place 1, 2, 3 in these slots. So, one possible arrangement is 1 + 2 - 3.Another is 1 + 3 - 2.Similarly, 2 + 1 - 3, 2 + 3 - 1, 3 + 1 - 2, 3 + 2 - 1. That's 6 permutations.Similarly, if the symbols are arranged as -, +.Then the slots are: _ - _ + _.Again, placing 1, 2, 3 in these slots gives another 6 permutations: 1 - 2 + 3, 1 - 3 + 2, 2 - 1 + 3, 2 - 3 + 1, 3 - 1 + 2, 3 - 2 + 1.So, in total, 6 + 6 = 12 permutations. That matches the calculation.Wait, but the problem says \\"permutations containing the digits 1, 2, 3, and the symbols +, -\\". So, does that mean that each permutation must include all three digits and both symbols? I think so, because otherwise, if we could omit some, the problem would specify. So, yes, each permutation must include 1, 2, 3, +, and -.So, that's 5 elements, which is what I considered earlier.Another way to think about this is using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or considering the positions.Alternatively, we can model this as arranging the digits and symbols such that digits are not adjacent.So, the total number of elements is 5: 3 digits and 2 symbols.If we want no two digits to be adjacent, we can use the concept of arranging the symbols first and then placing the digits in the gaps.As I did earlier, arranging the 2 symbols creates 3 gaps, and we have to place 3 digits into these gaps, one digit per gap.Therefore, the number of ways is 2! (for symbols) multiplied by 3! (for digits), which is 2 * 6 = 12.Alternatively, if I think about the general formula for such problems: if we have n non-adjacent items and m separators, the number of ways is m! * C(n, m) * n! ?Wait, no, that might not be the right approach here.Wait, actually, the formula is: if we have k non-adjacent items and m separators, the number of ways is C(m+1, k) * k! * m!.But in this case, we have 3 digits (k=3) and 2 symbols (m=2). So, the number of ways would be C(2+1, 3) * 3! * 2!.But C(3,3) is 1, so 1 * 6 * 2 = 12. So, same result.So, that's another way to see it.Alternatively, if I think of the problem as arranging the digits and symbols such that digits are not adjacent, the number of valid permutations is equal to the number of ways to arrange the symbols first, then place the digits in the gaps.Which is exactly what I did earlier.Therefore, I think 12 is the correct answer.But just to make sure, let me consider another approach.Suppose I consider all possible permutations of the 5 elements: 5! = 120. But that's without any restrictions.But we have a restriction: no two digits can be adjacent. So, we need to subtract the permutations where at least two digits are adjacent.But that might be more complicated because we have to consider overlapping cases.Alternatively, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, but that might be more involved.But let's see.Total permutations: 5! = 120.Now, subtract the permutations where at least two digits are adjacent.First, calculate the number of permutations where at least one pair of digits is adjacent.There are C(3,2) = 3 pairs of digits: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).For each pair, treat them as a single entity. So, we have 4 entities: the pair, the third digit, +, and -.So, the number of arrangements for each pair is 4! = 24. But since the pair can be in two orders (e.g., 12 or 21), we multiply by 2, so 24 * 2 = 48.But since there are 3 such pairs, the total is 3 * 48 = 144.But wait, this counts permutations where two pairs are adjacent multiple times. So, we have to subtract the cases where two pairs are adjacent, which would be when all three digits are adjacent.So, treating all three digits as a single entity, we have 3 entities: the digit block, +, and -.Number of arrangements: 3! = 6. And the digit block can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So, total is 6 * 6 = 36.Therefore, by inclusion-exclusion, the number of permutations with at least one pair of adjacent digits is 144 - 36 = 108.Therefore, the number of permutations with no two digits adjacent is total permutations minus this, which is 120 - 108 = 12.So, same answer as before.Therefore, this confirms that the number is indeed 12.So, whether I approach it by arranging symbols first and placing digits in gaps or by using inclusion-exclusion on total permutations, I get 12.Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 12.**Final Answer**The number of such permutations is boxed{12}."},{"question":"If the sum of the fractions frac{a}{b-c}, frac{b}{c-a}, frac{c}{a-b} is 0, then the sum of the fractions frac{a}{(b-c)^{2}}, frac{b}{(c-a)^{2}}, frac{c}{(a-b)^{2}} is also 0.

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down what I know. The given condition is:a/(b - c) + b/(c - a) + c/(a - b) = 0.And I need to show that:a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = 0.So, the first thought is, maybe I can manipulate the given condition to somehow relate it to the expression I need to prove. Maybe by differentiating or something? Or perhaps by multiplying both sides by something.Wait, let's think about the denominators. In the given condition, the denominators are linear terms, while in the expression to prove, they are squared. That makes me think that maybe if I take derivatives, since derivatives can turn linear terms into constants, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.Alternatively, maybe I can express the second sum in terms of the first. Let me denote S = a/(b - c) + b/(c - a) + c/(a - b) = 0.I need to compute T = a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.Hmm, perhaps I can relate T to S somehow. Maybe by differentiating S with respect to a variable? Or perhaps by multiplying S by something.Wait, another idea: if I consider S = 0, maybe I can find a relationship between a, b, c. Let me try to compute S.Let me write S as:S = a/(b - c) + b/(c - a) + c/(a - b).Let me bring all terms to a common denominator. The denominators are (b - c), (c - a), and (a - b). Let me note that (c - a) = -(a - c), and (a - b) = -(b - a). So, maybe I can write all denominators in terms of (a - b), (b - c), and (c - a).Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out the negatives.Wait, let me compute S:S = a/(b - c) + b/(c - a) + c/(a - b).Let me write each term with denominator (a - b)(b - c)(c - a). So, let's find a common denominator.The common denominator would be (b - c)(c - a)(a - b). Let me compute each numerator:For the first term: a/(b - c) becomes a*(c - a)(a - b).Second term: b/(c - a) becomes b*(a - b)(b - c).Third term: c/(a - b) becomes c*(b - c)(c - a).So, S = [a(c - a)(a - b) + b(a - b)(b - c) + c(b - c)(c - a)] / [(b - c)(c - a)(a - b)].Since S = 0, the numerator must be zero. So,a(c - a)(a - b) + b(a - b)(b - c) + c(b - c)(c - a) = 0.Let me expand each term:First term: a(c - a)(a - b) = a[(c)(a - b) - a(a - b)] = a[ca - cb - a^2 + ab] = a^2 c - a b c - a^3 + a^2 b.Second term: b(a - b)(b - c) = b[(a)(b - c) - b(b - c)] = b[ab - ac - b^2 + bc] = a b^2 - a b c - b^3 + b^2 c.Third term: c(b - c)(c - a) = c[(b)(c - a) - c(c - a)] = c[bc - ab - c^2 + a c] = b c^2 - a b c - c^3 + a c^2.Now, let's add all these together:First term: a^2 c - a b c - a^3 + a^2 bSecond term: + a b^2 - a b c - b^3 + b^2 cThird term: + b c^2 - a b c - c^3 + a c^2Combine like terms:- a^3 - b^3 - c^3+ a^2 c + a^2 b + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2- 3 a b cSo, the numerator is:(-a^3 - b^3 - c^3) + (a^2 c + a^2 b + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2) - 3 a b c.Hmm, I remember that the expression a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3 a b c factors into (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c). But here, we have negative a^3 - b^3 - c^3, so let me factor that.Wait, let me write the numerator as:-(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 c + a^2 b + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2) - 3 a b c.Let me factor this expression. Maybe grouping terms.Let me see:First, let's consider the terms with a^2:a^2 c + a^2 b = a^2(b + c)Similarly, terms with b^2:a b^2 + b^2 c = b^2(a + c)Terms with c^2:b c^2 + a c^2 = c^2(a + b)So, the numerator becomes:-(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) - 3 a b c.Let me write that as:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b - 3 a b c.Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me think.Wait, another approach: Let me factor the numerator.I know that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3 a b c = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c). So, if I can express the numerator in terms of that.But in our case, the numerator is:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b - 3 a b c.Let me rearrange terms:= (a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 3 a b c.Hmm, notice that a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b = (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - 3 a b c.Wait, let me check:(a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) = a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + a c^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + 3 a b c.So, (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) = (a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + a c^2 + b^2 c + b c^2) + 3 a b c.Therefore, (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - 3 a b c = a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + a c^2 + b^2 c + b c^2.So, our numerator is:[ (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - 3 a b c ] - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 3 a b c.Simplify:= (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - 3 a b c - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 - 3 a b c= (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 - 6 a b c.Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me think differently.Wait, maybe I can factor the numerator as (a + b + c)(something). Let me try.Wait, another idea: Let me consider that since S = 0, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others. For example, express a in terms of b and c, or something like that.But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can use symmetry or cyclic properties.Wait, another thought: Let me consider the expression T that I need to compute.T = a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.I need to show that T = 0.Hmm, perhaps I can relate T to the derivative of S with respect to a variable.Wait, let me think about differentiation. If I differentiate S with respect to a, what happens?Wait, S is a function of a, b, c, but in this problem, are a, b, c variables or constants? It's not specified, but I think they are variables.Wait, but in the given condition, S = 0, so maybe I can consider that as an identity, and then differentiate both sides.Wait, let me try that.Let me denote S = a/(b - c) + b/(c - a) + c/(a - b) = 0.If I differentiate S with respect to a, treating b and c as constants, then:dS/da = [1*(b - c) - a*0]/(b - c)^2 + [0*(c - a) - b*(-1)]/(c - a)^2 + [0*(a - b) - c*(1)]/(a - b)^2.Wait, no, actually, differentiation of each term:First term: d/da [a/(b - c)] = 1/(b - c).Second term: d/da [b/(c - a)] = b * d/da [1/(c - a)] = b * [1/(c - a)^2].Third term: d/da [c/(a - b)] = c * d/da [1/(a - b)] = c * [-1/(a - b)^2].So, putting it together:dS/da = 1/(b - c) + b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2.But since S = 0, dS/da = 0 as well, right? Because if S is identically zero, its derivative is zero.Therefore,1/(b - c) + b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = 0.Hmm, but this is not exactly T, which is a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.Wait, maybe I can relate this derivative expression to T.Let me write down:From dS/da = 0,1/(b - c) + b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = 0.Let me rearrange:b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(b - c).Hmm, interesting. Let me note that (c - a)^2 = (a - c)^2, and (a - b)^2 = (b - a)^2. So, perhaps I can write:b/(a - c)^2 - c/(b - a)^2 = -1/(b - c).Wait, but (a - c)^2 = (c - a)^2, so that's the same as before.Alternatively, maybe I can factor out something.Wait, let me think about the expression T:T = a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.Let me see if I can express T in terms of the derivative expressions.Wait, from the derivative, I have:1/(b - c) + b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = 0.So, rearranged:b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(b - c).Similarly, if I differentiate S with respect to b, maybe I can get another equation.Let me try that.Differentiating S with respect to b:dS/db = [1*(b - c) - a*0]/(b - c)^2 + [1*(c - a) - b*0]/(c - a)^2 + [0*(a - b) - c*(-1)]/(a - b)^2.Wait, no, more carefully:First term: d/db [a/(b - c)] = a * d/db [1/(b - c)] = a * (-1)/(b - c)^2.Second term: d/db [b/(c - a)] = [1*(c - a) - b*0]/(c - a)^2 = 1/(c - a).Third term: d/db [c/(a - b)] = c * d/db [1/(a - b)] = c * [1/(a - b)^2].So, putting it together:dS/db = -a/(b - c)^2 + 1/(c - a) + c/(a - b)^2.Since S = 0, dS/db = 0:-a/(b - c)^2 + 1/(c - a) + c/(a - b)^2 = 0.Rearranged:- a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(c - a).Hmm, interesting. Let me note that.Similarly, if I differentiate S with respect to c, I can get another equation.Let me compute dS/dc:First term: d/dc [a/(b - c)] = a * [0 - (-1)]/(b - c)^2 = a/(b - c)^2.Second term: d/dc [b/(c - a)] = b * [1/(c - a)^2].Third term: d/dc [c/(a - b)] = [1*(a - b) - c*0]/(a - b)^2 = 1/(a - b).So, putting it together:dS/dc = a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b).Since S = 0, dS/dc = 0:a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b) = 0.Hmm, so now I have three equations:1. From dS/da = 0:b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(b - c).2. From dS/db = 0:- a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(c - a).3. From dS/dc = 0:a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b) = 0.Wait, let me write these equations more clearly:Equation (1): b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(b - c).Equation (2): - a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(c - a).Equation (3): a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b) = 0.Hmm, perhaps I can solve these equations to find T.Wait, T is a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.Looking at Equation (3), it's almost T, except it has 1/(a - b) instead of c/(a - b)^2.Wait, let me see:Equation (3): a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b) = 0.So, if I can express 1/(a - b) in terms of other terms, maybe I can relate it to T.Wait, let me note that:From Equation (1):b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(b - c).Let me rearrange Equation (1):b/(c - a)^2 = c/(a - b)^2 - 1/(b - c).Similarly, from Equation (2):- a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(c - a).Rearranged:c/(a - b)^2 = a/(b - c)^2 - 1/(c - a).Hmm, maybe I can substitute these into Equation (3).Let me write Equation (3) again:a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b) = 0.From Equation (1), b/(c - a)^2 = c/(a - b)^2 - 1/(b - c).So, substitute into Equation (3):a/(b - c)^2 + [c/(a - b)^2 - 1/(b - c)] + 1/(a - b) = 0.Simplify:a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 - 1/(b - c) + 1/(a - b) = 0.Now, let me group terms:[a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2] + [-1/(b - c) + 1/(a - b)] = 0.Let me compute the second group:-1/(b - c) + 1/(a - b) = -1/(b - c) - 1/(b - a) = - [1/(b - c) + 1/(b - a)].Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me compute it as is:-1/(b - c) + 1/(a - b) = [ - (a - b) + (b - c) ] / [(b - c)(a - b)].Wait, let me compute numerator:-1*(a - b) + 1*(b - c) = -a + b + b - c = -a + 2b - c.So, the second group is (-a + 2b - c)/[(b - c)(a - b)].Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I can consider the first group:a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.Let me note that (a - b)^2 = (b - a)^2, so c/(a - b)^2 = c/(b - a)^2.Similarly, (b - c)^2 is same as (c - b)^2.Wait, maybe I can factor something out.Alternatively, perhaps I can express this group in terms of Equation (2).From Equation (2):c/(a - b)^2 = a/(b - c)^2 - 1/(c - a).So, substitute into the first group:a/(b - c)^2 + [a/(b - c)^2 - 1/(c - a)] = 2 a/(b - c)^2 - 1/(c - a).So, putting it all together, Equation (3) becomes:[2 a/(b - c)^2 - 1/(c - a)] + [(-a + 2b - c)/[(b - c)(a - b)]] = 0.Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.Wait, another idea: Let me consider that since S = 0, maybe I can write T as the derivative of S with respect to something.Wait, but earlier, when I took derivatives, I got expressions involving T, but not directly T itself.Wait, let me think about multiplying S by something. Since S is zero, maybe multiplying by a suitable expression would give me T.Wait, let me see:If I multiply S by (a - b)(b - c)(c - a), which is the common denominator, I get zero.But S times that denominator is equal to the numerator, which we already found is zero.Hmm, not helpful.Wait, another approach: Maybe I can consider that T is the derivative of S with respect to a variable, but I tried that earlier.Wait, perhaps I can consider that T is the sum of a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2, which is similar to the derivative of S with respect to a, b, or c, but not exactly.Wait, from earlier, when I took dS/da, I got:1/(b - c) + b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = 0.Similarly, for dS/db and dS/dc, I have similar expressions.Wait, let me write down all three derivatives:1. dS/da = 1/(b - c) + b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = 0.2. dS/db = -a/(b - c)^2 + 1/(c - a) + c/(a - b)^2 = 0.3. dS/dc = a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b) = 0.Hmm, interesting. Let me denote these as Equations (1), (2), and (3).Now, let me try to solve these equations for the terms involving T.Wait, T is a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.Looking at Equation (3), it's almost T, except it has 1/(a - b) instead of c/(a - b)^2.Wait, let me write Equation (3) as:a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 = -1/(a - b).So, if I can express a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 in terms of something, maybe I can find T.Wait, but T is a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.So, from Equation (3):a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 = -1/(a - b).Therefore, T = (-1/(a - b)) + c/(a - b)^2.Hmm, so T = (-1/(a - b)) + c/(a - b)^2.Let me factor out 1/(a - b):T = [ -1 + c/(a - b) ] / (a - b).Wait, that's T = [ - (a - b) + c ] / (a - b)^2.Simplify numerator:- (a - b) + c = -a + b + c.So, T = (-a + b + c)/(a - b)^2.Hmm, but I need to show that T = 0. So, unless (-a + b + c) = 0, which would make T = 0.But is (-a + b + c) = 0? Not necessarily, unless a = b + c.Wait, but from the given condition S = 0, does that imply a = b + c?Wait, let me check.From the given S = 0:a/(b - c) + b/(c - a) + c/(a - b) = 0.If I assume a = b + c, does that satisfy S = 0?Let me substitute a = b + c into S:S = (b + c)/(b - c) + b/(c - (b + c)) + (b + c)/((b + c) - b).Simplify each term:First term: (b + c)/(b - c).Second term: b/(c - b - c) = b/(-b) = -1.Third term: (b + c)/(c) = (b/c) + 1.So, S = (b + c)/(b - c) - 1 + (b/c + 1).Simplify:= (b + c)/(b - c) - 1 + b/c + 1.The -1 and +1 cancel:= (b + c)/(b - c) + b/c.Hmm, unless this equals zero, which would require (b + c)/(b - c) + b/c = 0.But that's not necessarily true unless specific conditions on b and c are met. So, a = b + c is not a general solution.Therefore, my earlier approach might not be correct. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that T can be expressed as above.Wait, let me go back.From Equation (3):a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 = -1/(a - b).So, T = a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = (-1/(a - b)) + c/(a - b)^2.So, T = (-1/(a - b)) + c/(a - b)^2.Let me write this as:T = [ - (a - b) + c ] / (a - b)^2.Which is:T = ( -a + b + c ) / (a - b)^2.So, T = (b + c - a)/(a - b)^2.Hmm, so for T to be zero, we need b + c - a = 0, i.e., a = b + c.But as I saw earlier, a = b + c doesn't necessarily satisfy S = 0 unless specific conditions on b and c are met.Wait, but maybe from S = 0, we can derive that b + c - a = 0.Wait, let me check.From S = 0:a/(b - c) + b/(c - a) + c/(a - b) = 0.Let me assume that a = b + c.Then, S becomes:(b + c)/(b - c) + b/(c - (b + c)) + (b + c)/((b + c) - b).Simplify:= (b + c)/(b - c) + b/(-b) + (b + c)/c.= (b + c)/(b - c) - 1 + (b/c + 1).Simplify:= (b + c)/(b - c) - 1 + b/c + 1.= (b + c)/(b - c) + b/c.Hmm, unless this equals zero, which would require (b + c)/(b - c) + b/c = 0.But that's not necessarily true. So, a = b + c is not a general solution.Therefore, my earlier approach might not be correct. Maybe I need a different method.Wait, another idea: Let me consider that T is the derivative of S with respect to some variable, but I tried that earlier and didn't get T directly.Wait, perhaps I can consider that T is related to the derivative of S with respect to a, b, or c, but I need to combine the derivatives.Wait, from Equation (1):b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(b - c).From Equation (2):- a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(c - a).From Equation (3):a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b) = 0.Let me try to add Equations (1), (2), and (3):Equation (1): b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(b - c).Equation (2): - a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = -1/(c - a).Equation (3): a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b) = 0.Adding all three:Left-hand side:b/(c - a)^2 - c/(a - b)^2 - a/(b - c)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 + a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + 1/(a - b).Simplify term by term:- b/(c - a)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 = 0.- c/(a - b)^2 + c/(a - b)^2 = 0.- a/(b - c)^2 + a/(b - c)^2 = 0.So, all the terms cancel except 1/(a - b).Right-hand side:-1/(b - c) -1/(c - a) + 0.So, adding the equations:1/(a - b) = -1/(b - c) -1/(c - a).Let me compute the right-hand side:-1/(b - c) -1/(c - a) = 1/(c - b) + 1/(a - c).Hmm, let me write them with a common denominator:= [ (a - c) + (c - b) ] / (c - b)(a - c).Simplify numerator:a - c + c - b = a - b.So, right-hand side = (a - b)/[(c - b)(a - c)].Therefore, we have:1/(a - b) = (a - b)/[(c - b)(a - c)].Multiply both sides by (a - b):1 = (a - b)^2 / [(c - b)(a - c)].So,(a - b)^2 = (c - b)(a - c).Let me expand both sides:Left-hand side: (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2.Right-hand side: (c - b)(a - c) = c a - c^2 - a b + b c.So,a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = c a - c^2 - a b + b c.Bring all terms to left-hand side:a^2 - 2ab + b^2 - c a + c^2 + a b - b c = 0.Simplify:a^2 - ab + b^2 - c a + c^2 - b c = 0.Hmm, let me rearrange:a^2 - a b - a c + b^2 - b c + c^2 = 0.Factor terms:a(a - b - c) + b(b - c) + c^2 = 0.Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, another approach: Let me factor the expression.a^2 - a b - a c + b^2 - b c + c^2.Let me group terms:(a^2 - a b - a c) + (b^2 - b c) + c^2.Factor a from first group:a(a - b - c) + b(b - c) + c^2.Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe I can write it as:a^2 - a(b + c) + b^2 - b c + c^2.Hmm, let me see if this can be factored.Wait, let me consider that a^2 - a(b + c) + b^2 - b c + c^2.Hmm, maybe complete the square for a.a^2 - a(b + c) = a^2 - a(b + c) + ( (b + c)^2 )/4 - ( (b + c)^2 )/4.So,= [a - (b + c)/2]^2 - (b + c)^2 /4 + b^2 - b c + c^2.Simplify the rest:- (b^2 + 2 b c + c^2)/4 + b^2 - b c + c^2.= - (b^2)/4 - (2 b c)/4 - (c^2)/4 + b^2 - b c + c^2.= (-b^2/4 - b c/2 - c^2/4) + b^2 - b c + c^2.Combine like terms:= ( -b^2/4 + b^2 ) + ( -b c/2 - b c ) + ( -c^2/4 + c^2 ).= (3 b^2 /4 ) + (-3 b c /2 ) + (3 c^2 /4 ).Factor out 3/4:= (3/4)(b^2 - 2 b c + c^2 ) = (3/4)(b - c)^2.So, the entire expression becomes:[a - (b + c)/2]^2 + (3/4)(b - c)^2 = 0.But since squares are non-negative, the only way this sum is zero is if both terms are zero.So,a - (b + c)/2 = 0 => a = (b + c)/2,and(b - c)^2 = 0 => b = c.But if b = c, then the denominators in S become zero, which is undefined. So, this is a contradiction.Hmm, that suggests that my earlier approach is flawed, or that the assumption that S = 0 leads to a contradiction unless b = c, which is not allowed.Wait, but the problem states that S = 0, so perhaps the only way for S to be zero is if b = c, but that would make the denominators zero, which is undefined. Therefore, maybe the only solution is when a, b, c are such that the numerator is zero without the denominators being zero.Wait, but earlier, when I expanded the numerator, I got:- a^3 - b^3 - c^3 + a^2 c + a^2 b + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2 - 3 a b c = 0.Which can be written as:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b) - 3 a b c = 0.Hmm, I think this can be factored as (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c) = 0.Wait, let me check:(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c) = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - a^2 b - a^2 c - a b^2 - a c^2 - b^2 c - b c^2 + 3 a b c.Wait, but in our case, the numerator is:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b) - 3 a b c.Which is equal to:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b) - 3 a b c.Which is equal to:- [a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - (a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b) + 3 a b c].Which is equal to:- [ (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c) ].Therefore, the numerator is:- (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c) = 0.So, for the numerator to be zero, either:1. a + b + c = 0, or2. a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c = 0.Case 1: a + b + c = 0.Case 2: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c = 0.Let me analyze Case 2.a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c = 0.This can be rewritten as:(1/2)[(a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2] = 0.Which implies that each square is zero, so a = b = c.But if a = b = c, then the denominators in S become zero, which is undefined. Therefore, Case 2 is not possible.Therefore, the only possibility is Case 1: a + b + c = 0.So, from the given condition S = 0, we must have a + b + c = 0.Okay, that's a key insight. So, a + b + c = 0.Now, knowing that a + b + c = 0, let's see if we can compute T.Recall that T = a/(b - c)^2 + b/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - b)^2.Given that a + b + c = 0, we can express one variable in terms of the others. For example, c = -a - b.Let me substitute c = -a - b into T.So, T becomes:a/(b - (-a - b))^2 + b/((-a - b) - a)^2 + (-a - b)/(a - b)^2.Simplify each term:First term: a/(b + a + b)^2 = a/(a + 2b)^2.Second term: b/(-a - b - a)^2 = b/(-2a - b)^2 = b/(2a + b)^2.Third term: (-a - b)/(a - b)^2.So, T = a/(a + 2b)^2 + b/(2a + b)^2 + (-a - b)/(a - b)^2.Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can find a common denominator or simplify further.Wait, let me note that (a + 2b) and (2a + b) are similar terms. Let me see if I can express them in terms of (a - b).Wait, another idea: Let me factor out terms.Wait, let me compute each term separately.First term: a/(a + 2b)^2.Second term: b/(2a + b)^2.Third term: (-a - b)/(a - b)^2.Hmm, perhaps I can write the third term as -(a + b)/(a - b)^2.Since a + b = -c, from a + b + c = 0.So, third term: -(-c)/(a - b)^2 = c/(a - b)^2.Wait, but c = -a - b, so maybe that's not helpful.Wait, let me think differently.Since a + b + c = 0, then c = -a - b.So, let me express all terms in T in terms of a and b.First term: a/(a + 2b)^2.Second term: b/(2a + b)^2.Third term: (-a - b)/(a - b)^2.So, T = a/(a + 2b)^2 + b/(2a + b)^2 - (a + b)/(a - b)^2.Hmm, let me see if I can combine these terms.Wait, perhaps I can write T as:T = [a/(a + 2b)^2 + b/(2a + b)^2] - (a + b)/(a - b)^2.Let me compute the first two terms:Let me denote x = a, y = b.So, first two terms: x/(x + 2y)^2 + y/(2x + y)^2.Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, another idea: Let me consider substituting variables to make the expressions symmetric.Let me set u = a + 2b, v = 2a + b.Then, u + v = 3a + 3b = 3(a + b).But since a + b + c = 0, a + b = -c.So, u + v = -3c.Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, let me try to compute T numerically with specific values to see if it's zero.Wait, let me choose specific values for a, b, c such that a + b + c = 0.For example, let me set a = 1, b = 1, then c = -2.Check if S = 0:S = 1/(1 - (-2)) + 1/((-2) - 1) + (-2)/(1 - 1).Wait, but denominator in the third term is zero, which is undefined. So, bad choice.Let me choose a = 1, b = 2, then c = -3.Compute S:1/(2 - (-3)) + 2/((-3) - 1) + (-3)/(1 - 2).Simplify:1/5 + 2/(-4) + (-3)/(-1) = 1/5 - 1/2 + 3.Compute:1/5 - 1/2 = (2 - 5)/10 = -3/10.-3/10 + 3 = (-3/10 + 30/10) = 27/10 ≠ 0.Hmm, so S ≠ 0 in this case, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, my choice of a, b, c must satisfy S = 0, which requires a + b + c = 0, but also the numerator being zero.Wait, but earlier, we saw that a + b + c = 0 is necessary for S = 0, but in my example, a + b + c = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0, but S ≠ 0. So, that suggests that my earlier conclusion that a + b + c = 0 is necessary might be incorrect.Wait, no, actually, when I expanded the numerator, I found that it's equal to - (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c). So, if a + b + c = 0, then the numerator is zero, hence S = 0.But in my example, a + b + c = 0, but S ≠ 0. That suggests that I made a mistake in my calculation.Wait, let me recalculate S for a = 1, b = 2, c = -3.S = a/(b - c) + b/(c - a) + c/(a - b).Compute each term:a/(b - c) = 1/(2 - (-3)) = 1/5.b/(c - a) = 2/(-3 - 1) = 2/(-4) = -1/2.c/(a - b) = (-3)/(1 - 2) = (-3)/(-1) = 3.So, S = 1/5 - 1/2 + 3.Compute:1/5 - 1/2 = (2 - 5)/10 = -3/10.-3/10 + 3 = (-3/10 + 30/10) = 27/10 ≠ 0.Hmm, so even though a + b + c = 0, S ≠ 0. That contradicts my earlier conclusion that a + b + c = 0 implies S = 0.Wait, but according to the numerator, when a + b + c = 0, the numerator is zero, hence S = 0. So, why in my example, S ≠ 0?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion of the numerator.Let me re-examine the numerator:Numerator = a(c - a)(a - b) + b(a - b)(b - c) + c(b - c)(c - a).Let me compute this for a = 1, b = 2, c = -3.Compute each term:a(c - a)(a - b) = 1*(-3 - 1)(1 - 2) = 1*(-4)*(-1) = 4.b(a - b)(b - c) = 2*(1 - 2)(2 - (-3)) = 2*(-1)*(5) = -10.c(b - c)(c - a) = (-3)*(2 - (-3))*(-3 - 1) = (-3)*(5)*(-4) = 60.So, numerator = 4 - 10 + 60 = 54 ≠ 0.But according to the earlier factorization, numerator should be zero when a + b + c = 0.Wait, but in this case, a + b + c = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0, but numerator = 54 ≠ 0.This suggests that my earlier factorization was incorrect.Wait, let me re-examine the factorization.I had:Numerator = - (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c).But when a + b + c = 0, numerator should be zero, but in my example, it's 54.Therefore, my factorization must be wrong.Wait, let me recompute the numerator.Numerator = a(c - a)(a - b) + b(a - b)(b - c) + c(b - c)(c - a).Let me expand each term again:First term: a(c - a)(a - b) = a(c a - c b - a^2 + a b) = a^2 c - a b c - a^3 + a^2 b.Second term: b(a - b)(b - c) = b(a b - a c - b^2 + b c) = a b^2 - a b c - b^3 + b^2 c.Third term: c(b - c)(c - a) = c(b c - b a - c^2 + c a) = b c^2 - a b c - c^3 + a c^2.Now, sum all terms:First term: a^2 c - a b c - a^3 + a^2 b.Second term: + a b^2 - a b c - b^3 + b^2 c.Third term: + b c^2 - a b c - c^3 + a c^2.Combine like terms:- a^3 - b^3 - c^3.+ a^2 c + a^2 b + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2.- 3 a b c.So, numerator = - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 c + a^2 b + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2) - 3 a b c.Now, let me factor this expression.I recall that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3 a b c = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c).But in our case, the numerator is:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 c + a^2 b + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2) - 3 a b c.Let me write this as:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2) - 3 a b c.Now, let me note that:a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2 = (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - 3 a b c.Wait, let me check:(a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) = a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + a c^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + 3 a b c.So, (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - 3 a b c = a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + a c^2 + b^2 c + b c^2.Therefore, our numerator becomes:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + [(a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - 3 a b c] - 3 a b c.Simplify:= - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a + b + c)(a b + a c + b c) - 6 a b c.Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, another idea: Let me consider that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3 a b c = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c).So, if I can express the numerator in terms of that.Our numerator is:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + (a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2) - 3 a b c.Let me write this as:- (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3 a b c) + (a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2 - 6 a b c).Wait, but a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3 a b c = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c).So, numerator = - (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c) + (a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2 - 6 a b c).Hmm, not sure.Wait, let me compute the second part:a^2 b + a^2 c + a b^2 + b^2 c + b c^2 + a c^2 - 6 a b c.Let me factor this:= a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) - 6 a b c.Since a + b + c = 0, we can substitute c = -a - b.So,= a^2(-a - b + b) + b^2(a - a - b) + (-a - b)^2(a + b) - 6 a b (-a - b).Wait, let me compute each term:First term: a^2(-a - b + b) = a^2(-a) = -a^3.Second term: b^2(a - a - b) = b^2(-b) = -b^3.Third term: (-a - b)^2(a + b) = (a^2 + 2 a b + b^2)(a + b) = a^3 + 2 a^2 b + a b^2 + a^2 b + 2 a b^2 + b^3 = a^3 + 3 a^2 b + 3 a b^2 + b^3.Fourth term: -6 a b (-a - b) = 6 a^2 b + 6 a b^2.So, putting it all together:= (-a^3) + (-b^3) + (a^3 + 3 a^2 b + 3 a b^2 + b^3) + (6 a^2 b + 6 a b^2).Simplify:- a^3 - b^3 + a^3 + 3 a^2 b + 3 a b^2 + b^3 + 6 a^2 b + 6 a b^2.= ( -a^3 + a^3 ) + ( -b^3 + b^3 ) + (3 a^2 b + 6 a^2 b) + (3 a b^2 + 6 a b^2).= 0 + 0 + 9 a^2 b + 9 a b^2.= 9 a b (a + b).But since a + b + c = 0, a + b = -c.So, = 9 a b (-c) = -9 a b c.Therefore, the numerator becomes:- (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a b - a c - b c) + (-9 a b c).But since a + b + c = 0, the first term is zero.Therefore, numerator = -9 a b c.Wait, but in my earlier example, a = 1, b = 2, c = -3, so numerator = -9 *1*2*(-3) = 54, which matches my earlier calculation.So, numerator = -9 a b c.Therefore, S = numerator / denominator = (-9 a b c) / [(b - c)(c - a)(a - b)].But S = 0, so numerator must be zero. Therefore, -9 a b c = 0.Thus, either a = 0, b = 0, or c = 0.But if a = 0, then S becomes:0/(b - c) + b/(c - 0) + c/(0 - b) = 0 + b/c - c/b.Which is zero only if b/c = c/b, which implies b^2 = c^2, so b = c or b = -c.But if b = c, denominators in S become zero, which is undefined. So, b = -c.Similarly, if a = 0, then b = -c.Similarly, if b = 0, then a = -c, and if c = 0, then a = -b.Therefore, the only solutions where S = 0 are when one of a, b, c is zero, and the other two are negatives of each other.So, for example, a = 0, b = k, c = -k.Let me test this case.Let a = 0, b = k, c = -k.Compute S:0/(k - (-k)) + k/(-k - 0) + (-k)/(0 - k).Simplify:0 + k/(-k) + (-k)/(-k) = 0 -1 + 1 = 0.Okay, so S = 0.Now, compute T:T = 0/(k - (-k))^2 + k/((-k) - 0)^2 + (-k)/(0 - k)^2.Simplify:0 + k/(k^2) + (-k)/(k^2) = 0 + 1/k - 1/k = 0.So, T = 0.Similarly, if b = 0, then a = -c.Compute T:a/(0 - c)^2 + 0/(c - a)^2 + c/(a - 0)^2.= a/c^2 + 0 + c/a^2.But since a = -c, substitute:= (-c)/c^2 + c/(-c)^2 = (-1)/c + c/c^2 = (-1)/c + 1/c = 0.Similarly, if c = 0, then a = -b.Compute T:a/(b - 0)^2 + b/(0 - a)^2 + 0/(a - b)^2.= a/b^2 + b/a^2 + 0.But since a = -b, substitute:= (-b)/b^2 + b/(-b)^2 = (-1)/b + b/b^2 = (-1)/b + 1/b = 0.Therefore, in all cases where S = 0, T = 0.Thus, the sum T is zero.Therefore, the proof is complete."},{"question":"Given that x=2 is a local minimum point of the function f(x)=x^{3}-3ax+2, then the maximum value of the function f(x) is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that x=2 is a local minimum point of the function f(x) = x³ - 3a x + 2, then the maximum value of the function f(x) is ______. Hmm, I need to find the maximum value. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a function to have a local minimum or maximum, its derivative at that point should be zero. So, I should start by finding the derivative of f(x). Let me compute that.f(x) = x³ - 3a x + 2So, f'(x) is the derivative with respect to x. The derivative of x³ is 3x², the derivative of -3a x is -3a, and the derivative of 2 is 0. So, putting it all together:f'(x) = 3x² - 3aOkay, now, since x=2 is a local minimum, the derivative at x=2 should be zero. So, let me plug x=2 into f'(x):f'(2) = 3*(2)² - 3a = 0Calculating that:3*(4) - 3a = 012 - 3a = 0So, solving for a:12 = 3aa = 4Alright, so a is 4. That means the function is f(x) = x³ - 3*4*x + 2 = x³ - 12x + 2.Now, I need to find the maximum value of this function. Hmm, wait, is this function f(x) a cubic function? Yes, it's a cubic because the highest power of x is 3. Cubic functions have one local maximum and one local minimum, right? So, since we already found that x=2 is a local minimum, there must be another critical point which is a local maximum.So, to find the maximum value, I need to find the other critical point where the derivative is zero. Let me set f'(x) = 0 again, but now with a=4.f'(x) = 3x² - 12 = 0Let me solve for x:3x² - 12 = 03x² = 12x² = 4x = ±2Wait, so the critical points are at x=2 and x=-2. We already knew x=2 is a local minimum, so x=-2 must be the local maximum. Therefore, the maximum value of the function occurs at x=-2.Now, I need to compute f(-2) to find the maximum value. Let's plug x=-2 into f(x):f(-2) = (-2)³ - 12*(-2) + 2Calculating each term:(-2)³ = -8-12*(-2) = 24So, f(-2) = -8 + 24 + 2Adding those up:-8 + 24 is 16, and 16 + 2 is 18.So, f(-2) = 18.Therefore, the maximum value of the function is 18.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, f'(x) = 3x² - 3a. At x=2, f'(2) = 0, so 3*(4) - 3a = 0 => 12 - 3a = 0 => a=4. That seems correct.Then, f(x) = x³ -12x + 2. Then, finding critical points by setting f'(x)=0: 3x² -12=0 => x²=4 => x=±2. So, x=2 is a local minimum, x=-2 is a local maximum. Then, f(-2) = (-2)^3 -12*(-2) + 2 = -8 +24 +2= 18. Yep, that seems right.Just to be thorough, maybe I should check the second derivative to confirm that x=-2 is indeed a maximum.The second derivative f''(x) is the derivative of f'(x). So, f'(x) = 3x² -12, so f''(x) = 6x.At x=2, f''(2) = 12, which is positive, so it's a local minimum. At x=-2, f''(-2) = -12, which is negative, so it's a local maximum. Perfect, that confirms it.So, the maximum value is 18.**Final Answer**The maximum value of the function is boxed{18}."},{"question":"If the graph of the proportional function y=kx passes through the first and third quadrants, then the value of the real number k can be ________. (Just write one suitable real number)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"If the graph of the proportional function ( y = kx ) passes through the first and third quadrants, then the value of the real number ( k ) can be ________.\\" I need to figure out what ( k ) can be. Hmm, let me think.First, I remember that a proportional function is a linear function that passes through the origin. So, its graph is a straight line going through (0,0). The general form is ( y = kx ), where ( k ) is the constant of proportionality, or the slope of the line.Now, the question says the graph passes through the first and third quadrants. Let me recall the quadrants on the coordinate plane. The first quadrant is where both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive, and the third quadrant is where both ( x ) and ( y ) are negative. So, if a line passes through both these quadrants, it must go from the third quadrant through the origin into the first quadrant.I also remember that the slope of a line determines its steepness and direction. If the slope is positive, the line rises from left to right, passing through the first and third quadrants. If the slope is negative, the line falls from left to right, passing through the second and fourth quadrants.So, in this case, since the line passes through the first and third quadrants, the slope ( k ) must be positive. That makes sense because if ( k ) is positive, when ( x ) is positive, ( y ) is positive, which is the first quadrant, and when ( x ) is negative, ( y ) is negative, which is the third quadrant.But wait, the question is asking for a suitable real number ( k ). It doesn't specify any particular value, just that it can be something. So, I just need to pick any positive real number. Let me think of a simple one. Maybe 1? Or 2? Or 0.5?Wait, but 0 is not positive, so that's not allowed. So, any positive number is acceptable. Maybe I can choose 1 because it's the simplest. Alternatively, 2 is also fine. Let me check.If ( k = 1 ), then the equation is ( y = x ). This line passes through the origin and has a slope of 1, which means it goes through the first and third quadrants. That works.Alternatively, if ( k = 2 ), the equation is ( y = 2x ). This line is steeper but still passes through the first and third quadrants. So, that also works.Wait, but the question says \\"the value of the real number ( k ) can be ________.\\" It doesn't specify that it has to be a particular number, just any suitable one. So, I can choose any positive real number. Maybe I should pick a simple integer, like 1 or 2, or maybe a fraction like 1/2.But let me think again. Since the question is asking for a suitable real number, and it's just one value, I can choose any positive number. Maybe 3? Or 0.5? Hmm, I think 1 is the simplest, so I'll go with that.But just to make sure, let me visualize the graph. If ( k = 1 ), the line is at a 45-degree angle, passing through (1,1), (2,2), etc., in the first quadrant, and (-1,-1), (-2,-2), etc., in the third quadrant. So, yes, it passes through both quadrants.Alternatively, if ( k = 2 ), the line is steeper, but still passes through both quadrants. So, either is fine. Since the question is asking for just one suitable real number, I can choose any positive number. Maybe I'll choose 1 because it's the most straightforward.Wait, but let me also consider if ( k ) can be zero. If ( k = 0 ), the equation becomes ( y = 0 ), which is the x-axis. The x-axis passes through the first and third quadrants? Wait, no. The x-axis is the boundary between the first and second quadrants, and the fourth and third quadrants. So, it doesn't pass through the first and third quadrants; it's the line that separates them. So, ( k = 0 ) is not suitable because it doesn't pass through the quadrants, just the axes.Therefore, ( k ) must be positive, not zero. So, any positive number is acceptable. Since the question is asking for one suitable real number, I can choose 1, 2, 3, 0.5, etc.But let me think if there's any restriction on ( k ). The problem says it's a proportional function, so ( k ) must be a real number, but it doesn't specify any other constraints. So, any positive real number is fine.Therefore, I can choose any positive number. Since the question just asks for one, I'll go with 1 because it's the simplest.Wait, but let me double-check. If ( k = 1 ), then ( y = x ) passes through the first and third quadrants. Yes, that's correct. So, 1 is a suitable value.Alternatively, if I choose ( k = -1 ), the line would pass through the second and fourth quadrants, which is not what we want. So, negative values are out.So, to recap, since the graph passes through the first and third quadrants, the slope must be positive. Therefore, ( k ) must be a positive real number. Since the question asks for one suitable value, I can choose any positive number. I think 1 is the easiest.But just to explore, what if ( k = 3 )? Then, ( y = 3x ) would be a steeper line, but still passing through the first and third quadrants. So, that's also acceptable.Alternatively, if ( k = 0.5 ), the line is less steep, but still passes through both quadrants. So, that's fine too.Therefore, any positive real number is acceptable. Since the question is asking for one suitable number, I can choose 1, 2, 3, 0.5, etc. I think 1 is the simplest, so I'll go with that.Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \\"the graph of the proportional function ( y = kx ) passes through the first and third quadrants.\\" So, as long as ( k ) is positive, it will pass through those quadrants. So, yes, 1 is a suitable value.Alternatively, if I choose ( k = 10 ), that's also fine. But 1 is the most straightforward.So, after considering all this, I think the answer is 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"On a shelf, there are 20 different books, including 6 mathematics books and 4 physics books.

Let me try to figure it out step by step. The vectors given are a = (-1, 0, 1) and b = (1, 2, 3). There's a real number k, and I need to find k such that when I compute k times vector a minus vector b, the resulting vector is perpendicular to vector b. Hmm, okay.First, I remember that two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero. So, if I have two vectors u and v, and u is perpendicular to v, then u · v = 0. That seems right. So in this case, the vector k*a - b should be perpendicular to vector b. Therefore, their dot product should be zero.Let me write that down:(k*a - b) · b = 0Okay, so I need to compute this dot product and solve for k. Let me compute each part step by step.First, let's compute k*a. Vector a is (-1, 0, 1), so multiplying by k gives:k*a = (k*(-1), k*0, k*1) = (-k, 0, k)Next, subtract vector b from this result. Vector b is (1, 2, 3), so subtracting b from k*a gives:k*a - b = (-k - 1, 0 - 2, k - 3) = (-k - 1, -2, k - 3)Okay, so now we have the vector k*a - b as (-k - 1, -2, k - 3). Now, we need to take the dot product of this vector with vector b, which is (1, 2, 3), and set it equal to zero.Let me compute the dot product:(-k - 1)*1 + (-2)*2 + (k - 3)*3 = 0Let me compute each term separately:First term: (-k - 1)*1 = -k - 1Second term: (-2)*2 = -4Third term: (k - 3)*3 = 3k - 9Now, adding all these together:(-k - 1) + (-4) + (3k - 9) = 0Let me combine like terms. Let's first combine the k terms:- k + 3k = 2kNow, the constant terms:-1 - 4 - 9 = -14So putting it all together:2k - 14 = 0Now, solving for k:2k = 14k = 14 / 2k = 7Wait, so k is 7?

So k is 7.Wait, just to be thorough, let me plug k=7 back into the original vectors and compute the dot product to make sure it's zero.Compute k*a - b when k=7:7*a = 7*(-1, 0, 1) = (-7, 0, 7)Subtract b: (-7 -1, 0 -2, 7 -3) = (-8, -2, 4)Now, take the dot product with b:(-8)*1 + (-2)*2 + 4*3 = (-8) + (-4) + 12 = (-12) + 12 = 0Yes, that works out.

Each ( a_n ) is defined as ( frac{1}{log_n 2002} ). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that logarithms can be converted from one base to another using the change of base formula. The formula is ( log_b a = frac{ln a}{ln b} ), where ( ln ) is the natural logarithm. So, if I apply this to ( a_n ), it should become ( frac{1}{frac{ln 2002}{ln n}} ), right?

Specifically, ( a_n = frac{ln n}{ln 2002} ). That simplifies things a bit because now I can express both ( b ) and ( c ) in terms of natural logarithms.So, let's write out ( b ) and ( c ) using this expression for ( a_n ).Starting with ( b ):[b = a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = frac{ln 2}{ln 2002} + frac{ln 3}{ln 2002} + frac{ln 4}{ln 2002} + frac{ln 5}{ln 2002}]Since all the terms have the same denominator, I can factor that out:[b = frac{1}{ln 2002} left( ln 2 + ln 3 + ln 4 + ln 5 right)]Similarly, for ( c ):[c = a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{14} = frac{ln 10}{ln 2002} + frac{ln 11}{ln 2002} + frac{ln 12}{ln 2002} + frac{ln 13}{ln 2002} + frac{ln 14}{ln 2002}]Again, factoring out the common denominator:[c = frac{1}{ln 2002} left( ln 10 + ln 11 + ln 12 + ln 13 + ln 14 right)]Now, to find ( b - c ), I subtract ( c ) from ( b ):[b - c = frac{1}{ln 2002} left( ln 2 + ln 3 + ln 4 + ln 5 right) - frac{1}{ln 2002} left( ln 10 + ln 11 + ln 12 + ln 13 + ln 14 right)]Since both terms have the same denominator, I can combine them:[b - c = frac{1}{ln 2002} left[ (ln 2 + ln 3 + ln 4 + ln 5) - (ln 10 + ln 11 + ln 12 + ln 13 + ln 14) right]]Hmm, okay. So, I need to compute the difference between the sum of logarithms from 2 to 5 and the sum from 10 to 14. That seems a bit involved, but maybe I can simplify it by combining the logarithms.I remember that the sum of logarithms is the logarithm of the product. So, ( ln a + ln b = ln(ab) ). Let me apply that to both the numerator and the denominator.First, for the numerator inside the brackets:[ln 2 + ln 3 + ln 4 + ln 5 = ln(2 times 3 times 4 times 5)]Calculating the product inside:[2 times 3 = 6; 6 times 4 = 24; 24 times 5 = 120]So, that sum is ( ln 120 ).Similarly, for the second part:[ln 10 + ln 11 + ln 12 + ln 13 + ln 14 = ln(10 times 11 times 12 times 13 times 14)]Calculating that product step by step:- ( 10 times 11 = 110 )- ( 110 times 12 = 1320 )- ( 1320 times 13 = 17160 )- ( 17160 times 14 = 240240 )So, that sum is ( ln 240240 ).Therefore, the expression for ( b - c ) becomes:[b - c = frac{1}{ln 2002} left( ln 120 - ln 240240 right)]Now, using the logarithm property ( ln a - ln b = ln left( frac{a}{b} right) ), we can rewrite this as:[b - c = frac{1}{ln 2002} ln left( frac{120}{240240} right)]Simplifying the fraction inside the logarithm:[frac{120}{240240} = frac{1}{2002}]Wait, is that right? Let me check:- ( 240240 ÷ 120 = 2002 ). Yes, because ( 120 times 2002 = 240240 ). So, indeed, ( frac{120}{240240} = frac{1}{2002} ).So, substituting back:[b - c = frac{1}{ln 2002} ln left( frac{1}{2002} right)]But ( ln left( frac{1}{2002} right) ) is equal to ( -ln 2002 ), since ( ln(1/x) = -ln x ).Therefore:[b - c = frac{1}{ln 2002} times (-ln 2002) = -1]So, the value of ( b - c ) is ( -1 ).Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning, I converted each ( a_n ) using the change of base formula correctly. Then I expressed both ( b ) and ( c ) as sums of logarithms, factored out the common denominator, and then combined the sums into products. The products were calculated correctly: 2×3×4×5 is 120, and 10×11×12×13×14 is 240240. Then, taking the ratio 120/240240 simplifies to 1/2002, whose logarithm is indeed -ln(2002). Multiplying by 1/ln(2002) gives -1. So, all steps seem correct. I think the answer is indeed -1.**Final Answer**boxed{-1}"},{"question":"Amanda and her family are going to re-paint all the walls inside their house. Before they get started they want to divide up the work. Since all the rooms in the house have different numbers and sizes of walls in them, they figure the fairest way to divide up the work is to count all the walls in the house and assign an equal number to each person. There are 5 people in Amanda's family, including herself. There are 9 rooms in the house. 5 of the rooms have 4 walls each. The other 4 rooms each have 5 walls each. To be fair, how many walls should each person in Amanda's family paint?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of walls in Amanda's house. There are 9 rooms in total, with 5 rooms having 4 walls each and 4 rooms having 5 walls each.I'll calculate the total number of walls by multiplying the number of rooms by the number of walls in each category and then adding them together.Next, since there are 5 people in Amanda's family, I'll divide the total number of walls by 5 to find out how many walls each person should paint.This will ensure that the workload is distributed equally among all family members."},{"question":"In Anchuria, a standardized state exam is conducted. The probability of guessing the correct answer to each exam question is 0.25. In 2011, in order to obtain a certificate, it was necessary to answer correctly three out of 20 questions. In 2012, the School Management of Anchuria decided that three questions were too few. Now it is required to correctly answer six out of 40 questions. The question is, if one knows nothing and simply guesses the answers, in which year is the probability of obtaining an Anchurian certificate higher - in 2011 or in 2012?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the Anchuria standardized exam. It's about calculating the probability of someone guessing enough answers correctly to pass the exam in two different years, 2011 and 2012. The question is asking which year has a higher probability of obtaining the certificate by just guessing.First, let me understand the problem. In 2011, you needed to answer correctly three out of 20 questions. In 2012, they changed the requirements to six out of 40 questions. Each question has four options, so the probability of guessing a correct answer is 0.25, and the probability of guessing incorrectly is 0.75.So, I need to calculate the probability of getting at least three correct answers in 2011 and the probability of getting at least six correct answers in 2012. Then, compare these two probabilities to see which one is higher.This sounds like a binomial probability problem. The binomial distribution gives the probability of having exactly k successes in n independent trials, with the probability of success on a single trial being p.The formula for the binomial probability is:P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.But since we need the probability of getting at least a certain number of correct answers, we need to calculate the cumulative probability from k to n. That is, for 2011, it's P(X >= 3) when n=20, p=0.25, and for 2012, it's P(X >= 6) when n=40, p=0.25.Calculating these cumulative probabilities can be a bit tedious because we have to sum up the probabilities from k to n. Alternatively, we can use the complement rule, which might be easier. The complement of getting at least k successes is getting fewer than k successes. So, P(X >= k) = 1 - P(X <= k-1).So, for 2011, P(X >= 3) = 1 - P(X <= 2). Similarly, for 2012, P(X >= 6) = 1 - P(X <= 5).Calculating these probabilities will require computing the sum of binomial probabilities from 0 up to 2 for 2011 and from 0 up to 5 for 2012.But since these calculations can be quite involved, especially for n=40, I might need to use a calculator or some approximation. However, since I'm just thinking through this, maybe I can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution to estimate these probabilities.The normal approximation is suitable when n is large and p is not too close to 0 or 1. For 2011, n=20, which is moderately large, and p=0.25, which is not too extreme. For 2012, n=40, which is larger, so the approximation should be better.The mean (mu) of a binomial distribution is n*p, and the standard deviation (sigma) is sqrt(n*p*(1-p)).So, for 2011:mu1 = 20 * 0.25 = 5sigma1 = sqrt(20 * 0.25 * 0.75) = sqrt(3.75) ≈ 1.936For 2012:mu2 = 40 * 0.25 = 10sigma2 = sqrt(40 * 0.25 * 0.75) = sqrt(7.5) ≈ 2.7386Now, to use the normal approximation, we can apply the continuity correction. For P(X >= k), we use P(X >= k - 0.5).So, for 2011, P(X >= 3) ≈ P(Z >= (2.5 - mu1)/sigma1)Similarly, for 2012, P(X >= 6) ≈ P(Z >= (5.5 - mu2)/sigma2)Calculating the z-scores:For 2011:z1 = (2.5 - 5)/1.936 ≈ (-2.5)/1.936 ≈ -1.291For 2012:z2 = (5.5 - 10)/2.7386 ≈ (-4.5)/2.7386 ≈ -1.643Now, we can look up these z-scores in the standard normal distribution table to find the probabilities.For z1 ≈ -1.291, the cumulative probability is about 0.10 (since z=-1.29 corresponds to about 0.10). So, P(Z >= -1.291) ≈ 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.Wait, no, that's not right. The cumulative probability for z=-1.29 is the probability that Z is less than or equal to -1.29, which is approximately 0.10. Therefore, P(Z >= -1.291) is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.Similarly, for z2 ≈ -1.643, the cumulative probability is about 0.05 (since z=-1.64 corresponds to about 0.05). So, P(Z >= -1.643) ≈ 1 - 0.05 = 0.95.Wait, that seems contradictory. If the z-score is more negative, the probability should be lower, but according to this, the probability is higher. That doesn't make sense.Wait, no, actually, when we're calculating P(X >= k), which translates to P(Z >= (k - 0.5 - mu)/sigma). So, for 2011, we have a z-score of -1.291, which means that the value is 1.291 standard deviations below the mean. So, the probability of being above that is higher than 0.5.Similarly, for 2012, the z-score is -1.643, which is further below the mean, so the probability of being above that is still higher than 0.5, but less than in 2011.Wait, no, actually, the z-scores are negative, so when we calculate P(Z >= z), where z is negative, it's equivalent to 1 - P(Z <= z). Since z is negative, P(Z <= z) is less than 0.5, so 1 - P(Z <= z) is greater than 0.5.But in 2011, z1 ≈ -1.291, so P(Z <= z1) ≈ 0.10, so P(Z >= z1) ≈ 0.90.In 2012, z2 ≈ -1.643, so P(Z <= z2) ≈ 0.05, so P(Z >= z2) ≈ 0.95.Wait, that would mean that in 2012, the probability is higher, which contradicts my initial intuition because in 2012, you have more questions and need to get more correct answers.But wait, let me double-check the calculations.For 2011:mu1 = 5sigma1 ≈ 1.936We need P(X >= 3). Using continuity correction, P(X >= 3) ≈ P(Z >= (2.5 - 5)/1.936) = P(Z >= -1.291). Since the normal distribution is symmetric, P(Z >= -1.291) = P(Z <= 1.291). Looking up 1.29 in the z-table, it's about 0.9015. So, P(Z >= -1.291) ≈ 0.9015.For 2012:mu2 = 10sigma2 ≈ 2.7386We need P(X >= 6). Using continuity correction, P(X >= 6) ≈ P(Z >= (5.5 - 10)/2.7386) = P(Z >= -1.643). Similarly, P(Z >= -1.643) = P(Z <= 1.643). Looking up 1.64 in the z-table, it's about 0.9495. So, P(Z >= -1.643) ≈ 0.9495.Wait, so according to this approximation, the probability in 2012 is higher (≈94.95%) than in 2011 (≈90.15%). That seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly, but the total number of questions is also higher. Maybe the probability is actually higher in 2012.But let me think again. The required number of correct answers is proportionally the same: 3 out of 20 is 15%, and 6 out of 40 is also 15%. So, the required proportion is the same, but the total number is different. Since the number of trials is higher, the distribution might be more spread out, but the required number is proportionally the same.Wait, but in 2011, the mean is 5, so getting 3 correct is below the mean, but in 2012, the mean is 10, so getting 6 correct is also below the mean. However, the z-scores are different because the standard deviations are different.Wait, but in 2012, the z-score is more negative, meaning it's further below the mean, so the probability of getting above that should be higher, but in reality, since it's further below, the probability should be lower. Wait, no, because when you have a more negative z-score, the area to the right of it is larger, meaning higher probability.Wait, no, that's not correct. If the z-score is more negative, the area to the left is smaller, so the area to the right is larger. So, for example, z=-1.64 has a smaller left area (0.05) than z=-1.29 (0.10). Therefore, the area to the right is larger for z=-1.64 (0.95) than for z=-1.29 (0.90). So, in 2012, the probability is higher.But that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly, but the proportion is the same. So, why is the probability higher?Wait, maybe because with more questions, the distribution is more spread out, so the probability of being just below the mean is higher. Wait, no, actually, the probability of being above a certain point that's proportionally the same as in the smaller sample might be higher because the distribution is more spread out.Alternatively, maybe the normal approximation isn't accurate enough here, especially for n=20. Maybe I should calculate the exact binomial probabilities.Let me try that.For 2011:n=20, p=0.25, k=3.We need P(X >=3) = 1 - P(X <=2).Calculating P(X=0): C(20,0)*(0.25)^0*(0.75)^20 ≈ 1*1*(0.75)^20 ≈ 0.00317P(X=1): C(20,1)*(0.25)^1*(0.75)^19 ≈ 20*0.25*(0.75)^19 ≈ 20*0.25*0.00429 ≈ 0.02145P(X=2): C(20,2)*(0.25)^2*(0.75)^18 ≈ 190*0.0625*(0.75)^18 ≈ 190*0.0625*0.00572 ≈ 190*0.0003575 ≈ 0.0679So, P(X <=2) ≈ 0.00317 + 0.02145 + 0.0679 ≈ 0.0925Therefore, P(X >=3) ≈ 1 - 0.0925 ≈ 0.9075 or 90.75%.For 2012:n=40, p=0.25, k=6.We need P(X >=6) = 1 - P(X <=5).Calculating P(X=0): C(40,0)*(0.25)^0*(0.75)^40 ≈ 1*1*(0.75)^40 ≈ 0.000000317 (very small)P(X=1): C(40,1)*(0.25)^1*(0.75)^39 ≈ 40*0.25*(0.75)^39 ≈ 10*(0.75)^39 ≈ 10*0.000000423 ≈ 0.00000423P(X=2): C(40,2)*(0.25)^2*(0.75)^38 ≈ 780*0.0625*(0.75)^38 ≈ 780*0.0625*0.000000564 ≈ 780*0.00000003525 ≈ 0.0000275P(X=3): C(40,3)*(0.25)^3*(0.75)^37 ≈ 9880*0.015625*(0.75)^37 ≈ 9880*0.015625*0.000000752 ≈ 9880*0.00000001178 ≈ 0.000116P(X=4): C(40,4)*(0.25)^4*(0.75)^36 ≈ 91390*0.00390625*(0.75)^36 ≈ 91390*0.00390625*0.000001003 ≈ 91390*0.00000000392 ≈ 0.000358P(X=5): C(40,5)*(0.25)^5*(0.75)^35 ≈ 658008*0.0009765625*(0.75)^35 ≈ 658008*0.0009765625*0.000001337 ≈ 658008*0.000000001308 ≈ 0.000862Adding these up:P(X <=5) ≈ 0.000000317 + 0.00000423 + 0.0000275 + 0.000116 + 0.000358 + 0.000862 ≈ 0.001368Therefore, P(X >=6) ≈ 1 - 0.001368 ≈ 0.998632 or 99.86%.Wait, that's a huge difference. According to the exact calculation, in 2011, the probability is about 90.75%, and in 2012, it's about 99.86%. So, the probability is much higher in 2012.But that seems really high for 2012. Let me check my calculations again.Wait, when calculating P(X=5) for 2012, I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate P(X=5):C(40,5) = 658008(0.25)^5 = 0.0009765625(0.75)^35 ≈ e^(35*ln(0.75)) ≈ e^(35*(-0.28768207)) ≈ e^(-10.069) ≈ 0.0000445So, P(X=5) = 658008 * 0.0009765625 * 0.0000445 ≈ 658008 * 0.0000000435 ≈ 0.0285Wait, that's different from what I had before. I think I messed up the exponent earlier. Let me recalculate all the terms properly.Calculating P(X=0): (0.75)^40 ≈ 0.000000317P(X=1): 40 * 0.25 * (0.75)^39 ≈ 10 * (0.75)^39. Since (0.75)^40 ≈ 0.000000317, then (0.75)^39 ≈ 0.000000317 / 0.75 ≈ 0.000000423. So, P(X=1) ≈ 10 * 0.000000423 ≈ 0.00000423P(X=2): C(40,2)=780, (0.25)^2=0.0625, (0.75)^38. Since (0.75)^40 ≈ 0.000000317, then (0.75)^38 ≈ 0.000000317 / (0.75)^2 ≈ 0.000000317 / 0.5625 ≈ 0.000000563. So, P(X=2) ≈ 780 * 0.0625 * 0.000000563 ≈ 780 * 0.0000000352 ≈ 0.0000275P(X=3): C(40,3)=9880, (0.25)^3=0.015625, (0.75)^37. (0.75)^37 ≈ (0.75)^40 / (0.75)^3 ≈ 0.000000317 / 0.421875 ≈ 0.000000751. So, P(X=3) ≈ 9880 * 0.015625 * 0.000000751 ≈ 9880 * 0.00000001176 ≈ 0.000116P(X=4): C(40,4)=91390, (0.25)^4=0.00390625, (0.75)^36. (0.75)^36 ≈ (0.75)^40 / (0.75)^4 ≈ 0.000000317 / 0.31640625 ≈ 0.000001002. So, P(X=4) ≈ 91390 * 0.00390625 * 0.000001002 ≈ 91390 * 0.000000003915 ≈ 0.000357P(X=5): C(40,5)=658008, (0.25)^5=0.0009765625, (0.75)^35. (0.75)^35 ≈ (0.75)^40 / (0.75)^5 ≈ 0.000000317 / 0.2373046875 ≈ 0.000001336. So, P(X=5) ≈ 658008 * 0.0009765625 * 0.000001336 ≈ 658008 * 0.000000001308 ≈ 0.000862Adding these up:P(X <=5) ≈ 0.000000317 + 0.00000423 + 0.0000275 + 0.000116 + 0.000357 + 0.000862 ≈ 0.001367So, P(X >=6) ≈ 1 - 0.001367 ≈ 0.998633 or 99.86%.Wait, that's still the same result. So, according to the exact calculation, in 2012, the probability is about 99.86%, which is much higher than in 2011, which was about 90.75%.But that seems really high. How can the probability be higher in 2012 when you have to answer more questions correctly? It's because the number of questions is doubled, but the required proportion is the same. So, the probability of getting at least 15% correct is higher when you have more questions because the law of large numbers makes the proportion more stable around the mean.Wait, but in 2011, the mean is 5 correct answers, and in 2012, it's 10. So, in 2011, getting 3 correct is below the mean, but in 2012, getting 6 correct is also below the mean. However, the standard deviation in 2012 is higher, so the probability of being above a certain point that's proportionally the same is higher.Wait, but in 2011, the probability of getting at least 3 correct is 90.75%, and in 2012, it's 99.86%. So, it's actually much higher in 2012.But that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly. However, the key is that the required number is proportionally the same (15% of the total), but with more questions, the probability of achieving that proportion is higher because the distribution is more spread out, but the required number is proportionally the same.Wait, actually, no. The probability should be higher in 2012 because the required number is proportionally the same, but with more trials, the probability of being above that proportion is higher. Wait, no, actually, the probability of being above a certain proportion is higher when the proportion is closer to the mean.Wait, in 2011, the mean is 5, and 3 is 2 below the mean. In 2012, the mean is 10, and 6 is 4 below the mean. So, in terms of standard deviations, 3 is (3-5)/1.936 ≈ -1.03 standard deviations below the mean in 2011, and 6 is (6-10)/2.7386 ≈ -1.46 standard deviations below the mean in 2012. So, in 2012, the required number is further below the mean in terms of standard deviations, which would mean a lower probability of being above that point. But according to the exact calculation, the probability is higher in 2012.Wait, that contradicts. So, maybe my exact calculation is wrong.Wait, let me check the exact calculation again.For 2012, n=40, p=0.25, k=6.P(X >=6) = 1 - P(X <=5)Calculating P(X=0): C(40,0)*(0.25)^0*(0.75)^40 ≈ 1*1*(0.75)^40 ≈ 0.000000317P(X=1): C(40,1)*(0.25)^1*(0.75)^39 ≈ 40*0.25*(0.75)^39 ≈ 10*(0.75)^39 ≈ 10*0.000000423 ≈ 0.00000423P(X=2): C(40,2)*(0.25)^2*(0.75)^38 ≈ 780*0.0625*(0.75)^38 ≈ 780*0.0625*0.000000564 ≈ 780*0.00000003525 ≈ 0.0000275P(X=3): C(40,3)*(0.25)^3*(0.75)^37 ≈ 9880*0.015625*(0.75)^37 ≈ 9880*0.015625*0.000000752 ≈ 9880*0.00000001178 ≈ 0.000116P(X=4): C(40,4)*(0.25)^4*(0.75)^36 ≈ 91390*0.00390625*(0.75)^36 ≈ 91390*0.00390625*0.000001003 ≈ 91390*0.00000000392 ≈ 0.000358P(X=5): C(40,5)*(0.25)^5*(0.75)^35 ≈ 658008*0.0009765625*(0.75)^35 ≈ 658008*0.0009765625*0.000001337 ≈ 658008*0.000000001308 ≈ 0.000862Adding these up:0.000000317 + 0.00000423 = 0.000004547+ 0.0000275 = 0.000032047+ 0.000116 = 0.000148047+ 0.000358 = 0.000506047+ 0.000862 = 0.001368047So, P(X <=5) ≈ 0.001368Therefore, P(X >=6) ≈ 1 - 0.001368 ≈ 0.998632 or 99.86%.That seems correct. So, in 2012, the probability is much higher.But wait, in 2011, the probability was about 90.75%, and in 2012, it's about 99.86%. So, the probability is higher in 2012.But that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly. However, the key is that the required number is proportionally the same (15% of the total), but with more questions, the probability of achieving that proportion is higher because the distribution is more spread out, but the required number is proportionally the same.Wait, actually, no. The probability should be higher in 2012 because the required number is proportionally the same, but with more trials, the probability of being above that proportion is higher. Wait, no, actually, the probability of being above a certain proportion is higher when the proportion is closer to the mean.Wait, in 2011, the mean is 5, and 3 is 2 below the mean. In 2012, the mean is 10, and 6 is 4 below the mean. So, in terms of standard deviations, 3 is (3-5)/1.936 ≈ -1.03 standard deviations below the mean in 2011, and 6 is (6-10)/2.7386 ≈ -1.46 standard deviations below the mean in 2012. So, in 2012, the required number is further below the mean in terms of standard deviations, which would mean a lower probability of being above that point. But according to the exact calculation, the probability is higher in 2012.Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.Wait, no, actually, when the required number is further below the mean in terms of standard deviations, the probability of being above that point is higher because it's further into the tail. Wait, no, the further below the mean, the smaller the area to the right of it, meaning lower probability.Wait, no, that's not correct. The area to the right of a point further below the mean is larger because it's closer to the mean. Wait, no, if the point is further below the mean, the area to the right of it is larger because it's including more of the distribution.Wait, let me think about it. If I have a normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma, the probability P(X >= mu - a*sigma) increases as a increases because the point mu - a*sigma is moving further to the left, so the area to the right of it increases.Wait, no, that's not correct. As a increases, mu - a*sigma moves further left, so the area to the right of it increases. So, for example, P(X >= mu - 1*sigma) is higher than P(X >= mu - 2*sigma).Wait, yes, that's correct. So, in 2011, the z-score is -1.03, and in 2012, it's -1.46. So, P(X >= mu -1.03*sigma) is higher than P(X >= mu -1.46*sigma). Wait, no, actually, the further left you go, the higher the area to the right. So, P(X >= mu -1.46*sigma) is higher than P(X >= mu -1.03*sigma). Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, let me clarify. For a normal distribution, the area to the right of a point increases as the point moves to the left. So, if you have two points, A and B, where A is to the left of B, then P(X >= A) > P(X >= B). So, in 2011, the z-score is -1.03, and in 2012, it's -1.46. Since -1.46 is to the left of -1.03, P(X >= -1.46) > P(X >= -1.03). Therefore, the probability in 2012 is higher.Wait, but in reality, the exact calculation shows that in 2012, the probability is higher, which aligns with this reasoning. So, even though the required number is further below the mean in terms of standard deviations, the probability of being above that point is higher because it's further to the left, encompassing more of the distribution.Therefore, the probability of obtaining a certificate by guessing is higher in 2012 than in 2011.But wait, that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly. However, the key is that the required number is proportionally the same (15% of the total), but with more questions, the probability of achieving that proportion is higher because the distribution is more spread out, but the required number is proportionally the same.Wait, no, actually, the probability is higher in 2012 because the required number is proportionally the same, but with more trials, the probability of being above that proportion is higher. Wait, no, actually, the probability of being above a certain proportion is higher when the proportion is closer to the mean.Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently.In 2011, you have a 90.75% chance of getting at least 3 correct answers out of 20.In 2012, you have a 99.86% chance of getting at least 6 correct answers out of 40.So, the probability is higher in 2012.Therefore, the answer is that the probability is higher in 2012."},{"question":"Calculate the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors a and b.begin{aligned}& a=2p+3q & b=p-2q & |p|=2 & |q|=3 & (widehat{p, q})=frac{pi}{4}end{aligned}","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors a and b. Hmm, I remember that the area of a parallelogram formed by two vectors is equal to the magnitude of their cross product. But wait, since we're dealing with vectors in terms of p and q, maybe I can express a and b in terms of p and q and then compute the cross product.First, let me write down the given vectors:a = 2p + 3q  b = p - 2qAnd the magnitudes of p and q are given as |p| = 2 and |q| = 3. Also, the angle between p and q is π/4. So, I think I can use the cross product formula which involves the sine of the angle between them.But wait, since a and b are expressed in terms of p and q, maybe I can find the cross product of a and b by expanding them. Let me recall that cross product is distributive over vector addition, so:a × b = (2p + 3q) × (p - 2q)Let me expand this:= 2p × p - 4p × q + 3q × p - 6q × qHmm, okay. Now, I remember that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so p × p = 0 and q × q = 0. That simplifies things:= 0 - 4p × q + 3q × p - 0Now, also, I remember that cross product is anti-commutative, meaning q × p = - (p × q). So, 3q × p = -3p × q. Let me substitute that:= -4p × q - 3p × qCombine like terms:= (-4 - 3)p × q  = -7p × qSo, the cross product a × b is equal to -7 times p × q. But since the area is the magnitude of the cross product, the negative sign doesn't matter. So, |a × b| = 7|p × q|.Now, I need to find |p × q|. The magnitude of the cross product of p and q is |p||q|sinθ, where θ is the angle between them. Given that |p| = 2, |q| = 3, and θ = π/4.So, |p × q| = |p||q|sin(π/4)  = 2 * 3 * sin(π/4)  = 6 * (√2 / 2)  = 3√2Therefore, |a × b| = 7 * 3√2 = 21√2.Wait, hold on, let me double-check my steps.1. Expanded a × b correctly: yes, 2p × p cancels, 6q × q cancels, and the middle terms are -4p × q + 3q × p, which becomes -4p × q -3p × q, totaling -7p × q.2. The magnitude is 7|p × q|: correct.3. Calculated |p × q|: 2*3*sin(π/4). Sin(π/4) is √2/2, so 6*(√2/2) is 3√2: correct.4. Multiply by 7: 7*3√2 is 21√2: correct.So, I think that's the answer. The area is 21√2.Wait, but just to make sure, is there another way to compute this? Maybe using the determinant method or something else?Alternatively, I can compute the area using the formula |a||b|sinφ, where φ is the angle between a and b. But that might be more complicated because I don't know the angle between a and b. Alternatively, I can compute the magnitude of a and b and then use the cross product formula.Wait, but let me see. Maybe I can compute the cross product another way. Since a and b are in terms of p and q, and p and q are not necessarily orthogonal, but we know their magnitudes and the angle between them.Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the area in terms of the base and height, but that also requires knowing the angle between a and b, which I don't have.So, I think the cross product method is the right way to go here.Wait, another thought: since the cross product is anti-commutative, does that affect anything? No, because we already accounted for that when we replaced q × p with -p × q.So, yeah, I think my steps are correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area using the formula involving the sine of the angle between p and q, but since a and b are linear combinations of p and q, it's more straightforward to compute their cross product.Let me just recap:a = 2p + 3q  b = p - 2q  a × b = (2p + 3q) × (p - 2q)  = 2p × p -4p × q + 3q × p -6q × q  = 0 -4p × q -3p × q + 0  = -7p × q  |a × b| = 7|p × q|  |p × q| = |p||q|sin(π/4) = 2*3*(√2/2) = 3√2  Thus, |a × b| = 7*3√2 = 21√2Yes, that seems consistent.Wait, another sanity check: the area should be larger than the product of the lengths of a and b times sin(theta), but since a and b are combinations, it's not straightforward. Alternatively, maybe compute |a| and |b|, then compute the angle between them, but that would require more steps and might not be necessary.Alternatively, let me compute |a| and |b| just to see:|a| = |2p + 3q|  = sqrt( (2p + 3q)·(2p + 3q) )  = sqrt(4|p|² + 12p·q + 9|q|²)  Similarly, |b| = |p - 2q|  = sqrt( (p - 2q)·(p - 2q) )  = sqrt(|p|² -4p·q + 4|q|²)But since we know p·q = |p||q|cos(π/4) = 2*3*(√2/2) = 3√2.So, compute |a|:= sqrt(4*(2)^2 + 12*(3√2) + 9*(3)^2)  = sqrt(16 + 36√2 + 81)  = sqrt(97 + 36√2)Similarly, |b|:= sqrt( (2)^2 -4*(3√2) + 4*(3)^2 )  = sqrt(4 -12√2 + 36)  = sqrt(40 -12√2)Hmm, so |a| is sqrt(97 + 36√2) and |b| is sqrt(40 -12√2). Then, if I wanted to compute the area as |a||b|sinφ, I would need sinφ, which is sqrt(1 - cos²φ). But since I don't know φ, the angle between a and b, this approach might not be helpful.Alternatively, maybe compute the area using the determinant formula if I express vectors in coordinates, but since p and q are not necessarily orthogonal, it's more complicated.Wait, but maybe I can express p and q in a coordinate system where p is along the x-axis, and q is in the xy-plane making an angle of π/4 with p.Let me try that.Let me set p along the x-axis, so p = (2, 0). Then, since the angle between p and q is π/4, and |q| = 3, q can be expressed as (3cos(π/4), 3sin(π/4)) = (3*(√2/2), 3*(√2/2)) = ( (3√2)/2, (3√2)/2 )So, now, express vectors a and b in terms of these coordinates.a = 2p + 3q  = 2*(2, 0) + 3*( (3√2)/2, (3√2)/2 )  = (4, 0) + ( (9√2)/2, (9√2)/2 )  = (4 + (9√2)/2, 0 + (9√2)/2 )  = ( (8 + 9√2)/2, (9√2)/2 )Similarly, b = p - 2q  = (2, 0) - 2*( (3√2)/2, (3√2)/2 )  = (2, 0) - ( 3√2, 3√2 )  = (2 - 3√2, 0 - 3√2 )  = (2 - 3√2, -3√2 )Now, to find the area of the parallelogram formed by a and b, I can compute the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors as columns (or rows).So, the determinant is:| ( (8 + 9√2)/2   ,   (9√2)/2 )    (2 - 3√2        ,   -3√2 ) |Compute this determinant:= [ (8 + 9√2)/2 ] * [ -3√2 ] - [ (9√2)/2 ] * [ 2 - 3√2 ]Let me compute each term step by step.First term: [ (8 + 9√2)/2 ] * [ -3√2 ]  = (8 + 9√2) * (-3√2) / 2  = [8*(-3√2) + 9√2*(-3√2)] / 2  = [ -24√2 - 27*(√2*√2) ] / 2  = [ -24√2 - 27*2 ] / 2  = [ -24√2 - 54 ] / 2  = -12√2 - 27Second term: [ (9√2)/2 ] * [ 2 - 3√2 ]  = (9√2)*(2 - 3√2)/2  = [18√2 - 27*(√2*√2)] / 2  = [18√2 - 27*2 ] / 2  = [18√2 - 54 ] / 2  = 9√2 - 27Now, subtract the second term from the first term:Determinant = ( -12√2 - 27 ) - ( 9√2 - 27 )  = -12√2 - 27 - 9√2 + 27  = (-12√2 - 9√2) + (-27 + 27)  = (-21√2) + 0  = -21√2So, the determinant is -21√2, and the absolute value is 21√2. Therefore, the area is 21√2.Wait, so both methods gave me the same result. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute the cross product directly or express the vectors in coordinates and compute the determinant, I get the same area.Therefore, I can be confident that the area is 21√2.**Final Answer**The area of the parallelogram is boxed{21sqrt{2}}."},{"question":"Use squares and equilateral triangles with the same side length to tessellate a plane. Around one vertex, there are     equilateral triangles and     squares.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to use squares and equilateral triangles with the same side length to tessellate a plane. The question is asking how many equilateral triangles and squares meet around one vertex. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.First, I remember that tessellation means covering the plane with shapes without any gaps or overlaps. So, around each vertex where the shapes meet, the angles have to add up to 360 degrees. That makes sense because a full circle around a point is 360 degrees.Now, the shapes involved are squares and equilateral triangles. I know the interior angles of these shapes. For a square, each interior angle is 90 degrees because all angles in a square are right angles. For an equilateral triangle, each interior angle is 60 degrees since all sides and angles are equal.So, if I'm trying to figure out how many of each shape can meet at a vertex, I need to find a combination of 90-degree angles and 60-degree angles that add up to 360 degrees. Let me write that down:Number of squares * 90 + Number of triangles * 60 = 360Let me denote the number of squares as 's' and the number of triangles as 't'. So, the equation becomes:90s + 60t = 360I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 30 to make the numbers smaller:3s + 2t = 12Okay, so now I have 3s + 2t = 12. I need to find integer solutions for s and t because you can't have a fraction of a square or triangle meeting at a vertex.Let me think about possible values for s and t. Since both s and t have to be positive integers (you can't have zero or negative shapes around a vertex), let me try plugging in some numbers.Starting with s = 1:3(1) + 2t = 12  3 + 2t = 12  2t = 9  t = 4.5Hmm, that's not an integer. So, s can't be 1.Trying s = 2:3(2) + 2t = 12  6 + 2t = 12  2t = 6  t = 3Okay, that works. So, if I have 2 squares and 3 triangles around a vertex, the angles add up to 360 degrees. Let me check:2 squares contribute 2 * 90 = 180 degrees  3 triangles contribute 3 * 60 = 180 degrees  Total: 180 + 180 = 360 degreesPerfect, that's exactly what we need.Let me see if there are other solutions. Trying s = 3:3(3) + 2t = 12  9 + 2t = 12  2t = 3  t = 1.5Not an integer, so that doesn't work.s = 4:3(4) + 2t = 12  12 + 2t = 12  2t = 0  t = 0But t can't be zero because we need both squares and triangles. So, s = 4 isn't a valid solution either.What about s = 0? Well, that would mean all triangles, which isn't the case here since we have both squares and triangles.So, the only valid solution is s = 2 and t = 3.Wait, just to make sure, is there another way to arrange them? Maybe with more triangles and fewer squares? Let me try s = 1 again, but maybe I made a mistake.s = 1 gives t = 4.5, which isn't possible. So, no. How about s = 3? t = 1.5, still not an integer. So, no.Alternatively, maybe s = 4 and t = 0, but that's just squares, which is a regular tessellation, but the problem specifies using both squares and triangles.So, the only possible way is 2 squares and 3 triangles meeting at each vertex.Let me visualize this. If I have two squares and three triangles around a point, how would that look? Each square contributes a 90-degree angle, and each triangle contributes a 60-degree angle.So, starting from the vertex, if I place a square, then a triangle, then another square, then another triangle, and another triangle. Wait, that might not fit perfectly. Let me think about the arrangement.Actually, the arrangement could be alternating between squares and triangles, but since we have two squares and three triangles, it might not be a perfect alternation. Maybe it's two squares and three triangles arranged in some order around the vertex.But regardless of the order, as long as the angles add up, it should tessellate. So, 2 squares and 3 triangles give the required 360 degrees.Therefore, the answer should be 3 equilateral triangles and 2 squares around each vertex.Wait, hold on, the problem says \\"Around one vertex, there are     equilateral triangles and     squares.\\" So, it's asking for the number of triangles and squares, respectively. So, it's 3 triangles and 2 squares.But just to make sure, let me think about the semi-regular tessellations, also known as Archimedean tessellations. I remember that one of them is 3.4.6.4, which is triangles, squares, hexagons, squares around each vertex. But that's a different case because it includes hexagons as well.Wait, no, in this problem, we are only using squares and triangles, so it's a different type of tessellation. The one I'm thinking of is called the \\"snub square tiling,\\" but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that might include triangles and squares as well.Alternatively, maybe it's the \\"trihexagonal tiling,\\" but that uses triangles and hexagons. Hmm.Wait, actually, the combination of squares and triangles can form a tessellation where each vertex has two squares and two triangles, but that would give 2*90 + 2*60 = 180 + 120 = 300, which is less than 360. So, that can't be.Alternatively, if I have three squares and two triangles, that's 3*90 + 2*60 = 270 + 120 = 390, which is more than 360. So, that's too much.Wait, so the only way is two squares and three triangles, which gives exactly 360. So, that must be the correct answer.Just to confirm, I can think about the angles:Each square contributes 90°, so two squares contribute 180°. Each triangle contributes 60°, so three triangles contribute 180°. 180 + 180 = 360°, which is perfect for a full circle around a vertex.Therefore, the number of equilateral triangles is 3 and the number of squares is 2 around each vertex.**Final Answer**Around one vertex, there are boxed{3} equilateral triangles and boxed{2} squares."},{"question":"Given space vectors overrightarrow{a}=(-3,2,5), overrightarrow{b}=(1,x,-1), and overrightarrow{a} is perpendicular to overrightarrow{b}, then x is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about vectors. It says that vector a is (-3, 2, 5) and vector b is (1, x, -1). They also mention that vector a is perpendicular to vector b, and I need to find the value of x. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. Yeah, that's a key point. So, the dot product of vectors a and b should equal zero. Let me write that down.So, the dot product formula for two vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is a1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3. Applying that here, I can compute the dot product of a and b.Let me substitute the given values into the formula. Vector a is (-3, 2, 5) and vector b is (1, x, -1). So, plugging these into the dot product formula:(-3)*1 + 2*x + 5*(-1) = 0.Let me compute each term step by step to avoid mistakes. First term: (-3)*1 is -3. Second term: 2*x is 2x. Third term: 5*(-1) is -5. So, putting it all together:-3 + 2x - 5 = 0.Now, let me simplify this equation. Combine the constants first: -3 -5 is -8. So, the equation becomes:2x - 8 = 0.To solve for x, I can add 8 to both sides:2x = 8.Then, divide both sides by 2:x = 4.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the dot product:(-3)*1 = -3.2*x = 2x.5*(-1) = -5.Adding them up: -3 + 2x -5 = 0.Combine constants: -3 -5 = -8.So, 2x -8 = 0.Adding 8: 2x = 8.Dividing by 2: x = 4.Hmm, seems correct. Maybe I can verify it by plugging x back into vector b and computing the dot product again.So, vector b becomes (1, 4, -1). Then, the dot product with a is:(-3)*1 + 2*4 + 5*(-1).Calculating each term:-3*1 = -3.2*4 = 8.5*(-1) = -5.Adding them up: -3 + 8 -5.-3 -5 is -8, plus 8 is 0. Perfect, that confirms it.So, x is 4.I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the verification step worked out. So, yeah, x must be 4.**Final Answer**The value of ( x ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"We write the integers from 1 to 2011 on the board. At each step, we erase two numbers and write their difference in their place. Thus, the number of integers decreases by 1. Can the last integer obtained at the two-thousandth and tenth step be equal to 1?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I write the integers from 1 to 2011 on a board. Then, at each step, I erase two numbers and write their difference in their place. This reduces the total number of integers by one each time. The question is asking if it's possible that after 2010 steps, the last remaining integer is 1.Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, starting with numbers 1 through 2011, each step involves picking two numbers, say a and b, and replacing them with |a - b|. The key here is that each operation reduces the count by one, so after 2010 operations, only one number remains.I remember something about invariants in such problems. An invariant is a property that remains unchanged throughout the operations. Maybe I can find such a property here.Let me think about the sum of all numbers on the board. Initially, the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 2011. The formula for the sum of the first n integers is n(n + 1)/2. So, plugging in 2011, the sum is 2011*2012/2. Let me compute that:2011 * 2012 / 2 = (2011 * 1006) = Let's compute 2000*1006 = 2,012,000 and 11*1006 = 11,066. So total is 2,012,000 + 11,066 = 2,023,066.So, the initial sum is 2,023,066.Now, when we replace two numbers a and b with |a - b|, what happens to the sum? The new sum becomes sum - a - b + |a - b|. So, the change in sum is -a - b + |a - b|.Let me consider two cases:1. If a ≥ b, then |a - b| = a - b. So, the change is -a - b + (a - b) = -2b.2. If b > a, then |a - b| = b - a. So, the change is -a - b + (b - a) = -2a.In both cases, the sum decreases by twice the smaller number. So, the sum is not an invariant; it decreases each time.Hmm, maybe instead of the sum, I should think about something else. Maybe the parity, or something modulo some number.Wait, another idea: the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers on the board. When we replace two numbers a and b with |a - b|, the GCD of the entire set doesn't change. Because GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, |a - b|). So, the GCD remains the same throughout the operations.Let me verify that. Suppose I have two numbers a and b, and their GCD is d. Then, both a and b are multiples of d. So, |a - b| is also a multiple of d. Therefore, the GCD of the new set will still be at least d. But since we're replacing two multiples of d with another multiple of d, the overall GCD can't increase. So, the GCD remains the same.Therefore, the GCD of all numbers on the board is an invariant.So, initially, the numbers are from 1 to 2011. What is the GCD of all these numbers? Well, since 1 is included, the GCD is 1. Because 1 is a divisor of every number. So, the GCD remains 1 throughout all operations.Therefore, the last remaining number must be a multiple of 1, which is any integer. So, that doesn't restrict it to 1 necessarily. Hmm, so maybe that's not enough.Wait, but the last number is the GCD of all numbers, right? Because through repeated subtraction, we're essentially performing the Euclidean algorithm on all numbers. So, the last number should be the GCD of all the numbers, which is 1. So, does that mean the last number must be 1?Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The GCD of all numbers is 1, but does that necessarily mean that the last number is 1? Or can it be some multiple of 1?Wait, no, because each operation replaces two numbers with their difference, which is similar to the steps in the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm reduces two numbers to their GCD by repeatedly subtracting the smaller from the larger. So, if we have multiple numbers, the process of replacing two numbers with their difference would eventually result in their GCD.But in this case, since we have more than two numbers, does the same logic apply? Let me think.Suppose we have three numbers: a, b, c. If we replace a and b with |a - b|, then we have |a - b| and c. Then, replacing these two would give us the GCD of |a - b| and c, which is the same as GCD(a, b, c). So, yes, it seems that regardless of the order, the final number would be the GCD of all the initial numbers.Since the GCD of 1 to 2011 is 1, the last number must be 1. So, the answer is yes, it can be 1.But wait, hold on. Let me test this with a smaller example to make sure.Suppose I have numbers 1, 2, 3.What's the GCD? It's 1.Let's perform the operations:Step 1: Replace 2 and 3 with |2 - 3| = 1. Now, numbers are 1, 1.Step 2: Replace 1 and 1 with |1 - 1| = 0. Now, only 0 remains. Wait, that's not 1.Hmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, what went wrong?Wait, in this case, the GCD is 1, but the final number is 0. So, my earlier reasoning must be flawed.Wait, maybe the invariant is not exactly the GCD, but something else.Wait, let's see. When I have numbers 1, 2, 3, their GCD is 1, but the operations can lead to 0. So, perhaps the last number can be any multiple of the GCD, including 0.But 0 is a multiple of every integer, including 1. So, perhaps the last number is a multiple of the GCD, which is 1, so it can be any integer, including 0 or 1.But in the case above, we ended up with 0. So, how can we get 1?Wait, let me try another sequence of operations on 1, 2, 3.Step 1: Replace 1 and 2 with |1 - 2| = 1. Now, numbers are 1, 3.Step 2: Replace 1 and 3 with |1 - 3| = 2. Now, only 2 remains.Hmm, so in this case, the final number is 2, which is not 1. So, the last number can vary depending on the operations.Wait, so maybe the GCD is not necessarily the last number? Or perhaps it's something else.Wait, maybe the parity of the sum is an invariant? Let me check.In the initial sum, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is even.After replacing 2 and 3 with 1, the new sum is 1 + 1 = 2, which is still even.Then replacing 1 and 1 with 0, sum is 0, which is even.Alternatively, in the second case, replacing 1 and 2 with 1, sum becomes 1 + 3 = 4, still even.Then replacing 1 and 3 with 2, sum becomes 2, which is even.So, the parity of the sum is invariant. It remains even throughout the operations.So, in the initial problem, the sum is 2,023,066, which is even. So, the last number must be even, because the sum is even, and each operation preserves the parity.Wait, so in my small example, the sum was 6, which is even, and the last number was 0 or 2, both even. So, in the original problem, since the sum is even, the last number must be even.Therefore, the last number cannot be 1, which is odd.Wait, so that contradicts my earlier conclusion about the GCD. Hmm.So, which one is correct?Wait, the key here is that the GCD is 1, but the last number must have the same parity as the initial sum. Since the initial sum is even, the last number must be even. Therefore, even though the GCD is 1, the last number cannot be 1 because it must be even.Therefore, the answer is no, the last number cannot be 1.Wait, so my initial thought was wrong because I didn't consider the parity. The GCD is 1, but the parity restricts the last number to be even.So, in the smaller example, the GCD is 1, but the last number can be 0 or 2, both even.Similarly, in the original problem, the last number must be even, so it cannot be 1.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, let me double-check.Another small example: numbers 1, 2.Sum is 3, which is odd.Replacing 1 and 2 with 1, so last number is 1, which is odd. So, in this case, the last number is 1, which is odd, matching the initial sum's parity.So, in the original problem, the sum is even, so the last number must be even. Therefore, 1 is odd, so it cannot be the last number.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, in the initial problem, the numbers are from 1 to 2011, which is an odd number of numbers. Each operation reduces the count by 1, so after 2010 operations, we have 1 number left.But the sum is even, so the last number must be even.Therefore, 1 is odd, so it cannot be achieved.Therefore, the answer is no.Wait, but let me think again. Is the parity of the sum the only invariant? Or is there another invariant?Wait, another thought: the sum modulo something else.But since in each step, the sum decreases by 2*min(a,b), which is even. So, the sum's parity doesn't change because we subtract an even number each time.Therefore, the parity of the sum is preserved.So, starting with an even sum, ending with an even number.Therefore, the last number must be even, so 1 is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, in the small example with 1,2,3, the GCD is 1, but the last number is even. So, the GCD is 1, but the last number is a multiple of GCD, which is 1, but also has to have the same parity as the initial sum.So, in that case, the last number is 0 or 2, both multiples of 1 and even.Similarly, in the original problem, the last number must be a multiple of 1 (so any integer) but also even, because the initial sum is even.Therefore, the last number must be even, so 1 is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.Is there a way to make the last number 1 despite the sum being even?Wait, no, because each operation preserves the parity of the sum. So, if the sum is even, it remains even, so the last number must be even.Therefore, it's impossible for the last number to be 1.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, let me check another small example.Numbers: 1, 3.Sum is 4, which is even.Replace 1 and 3 with 2. So, last number is 2, which is even.Alternatively, replace 3 and 1 with 2. Same result.So, in this case, the last number is 2, which is even.Another example: numbers 2, 4.Sum is 6, even.Replace 2 and 4 with 2. Last number is 2, even.Alternatively, replace 4 and 2 with 2.So, same result.Another example: numbers 1, 2, 4.Sum is 7, which is odd.Replace 1 and 2 with 1. Now, numbers are 1, 4.Replace 1 and 4 with 3. Last number is 3, which is odd.Alternatively, replace 2 and 4 with 2. Now, numbers are 1, 2.Replace 1 and 2 with 1. Last number is 1, which is odd.So, in this case, the last number can be 1 or 3, both odd, matching the initial sum's parity.Therefore, the parity is indeed an invariant.Therefore, in the original problem, since the sum is even, the last number must be even. Therefore, 1 is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, let me think about another invariant. Maybe the sum modulo something else.Wait, another idea: the sum modulo 2 is invariant, as we saw. But maybe the sum modulo another number is also invariant.Wait, but in the problem, the operations replace two numbers a and b with |a - b|. So, the sum changes by -2*min(a,b). So, the change is a multiple of 2, so the sum modulo 2 is invariant.But is there another invariant? Maybe the sum modulo something else.Wait, for example, modulo 3.Let me see.In the initial sum, 2,023,066. Let me compute 2,023,066 modulo 3.Sum of digits: 2+0+2+3+0+6+6 = 2+2+3+6+6 = 19. 19 modulo 3 is 1. So, the initial sum is 1 modulo 3.After each operation, the sum decreases by 2*min(a,b). So, the change is -2*min(a,b). Therefore, modulo 3, the change is (-2*min(a,b)) mod 3.So, depending on min(a,b), the change can be different.Therefore, the sum modulo 3 is not necessarily invariant.Similarly, for other moduli, unless the change is 0 modulo that number.Therefore, the only invariant we can be sure of is the parity, i.e., modulo 2.Therefore, the sum modulo 2 is invariant.Thus, since the initial sum is even, the last number must be even.Therefore, 1 is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, let me check another small example where the sum is even but the GCD is 1.Numbers: 1, 3, 4.Sum is 8, which is even.GCD is 1.Let's perform operations:Step 1: Replace 1 and 3 with 2. Now, numbers are 2, 4.Step 2: Replace 2 and 4 with 2. Last number is 2, which is even.Alternatively, step 1: Replace 3 and 4 with 1. Now, numbers are 1, 1.Step 2: Replace 1 and 1 with 0. Last number is 0, which is even.So, in both cases, the last number is even, despite the GCD being 1.Therefore, the conclusion is that the last number must be even, so 1 is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, in the problem statement, it says \\"their difference\\". So, is it the absolute difference? Because in the problem statement, it's written as \\"their difference\\", which could be interpreted as |a - b|, but sometimes difference is considered as a - b, which could be negative.But in the context of writing on the board, it's more likely to be the absolute difference, because otherwise, you could have negative numbers, which might complicate things.But even if it's not absolute, the difference could be positive or negative, but when you write it on the board, you might take the absolute value, or maybe not.Wait, the problem says \\"their difference\\", so I think it's safe to assume it's the absolute difference, because otherwise, the numbers could become negative, and the problem doesn't specify handling negative numbers.Therefore, I think it's safe to proceed with the absolute difference.Therefore, the invariant is the parity of the sum.Therefore, the last number must be even, so 1 is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.Is there a way to manipulate the operations such that the last number is 1 despite the sum being even?Wait, no, because each operation preserves the parity of the sum. So, if the sum is even, it remains even, so the last number must be even.Therefore, 1 is impossible.Therefore, the answer is no.But wait, let me think about another invariant. Maybe the total number of odd numbers on the board.Wait, initially, from 1 to 2011, how many odd numbers are there?2011 is odd, so the count of odd numbers is (2011 + 1)/2 = 1006.So, there are 1006 odd numbers initially.Now, let's see what happens when we replace two numbers with their difference.Case 1: Both numbers are even.Their difference is even - even = even. So, replacing two evens with an even. The number of odd numbers remains the same.Case 2: Both numbers are odd.Their difference is odd - odd = even. So, replacing two odds with an even. The number of odd numbers decreases by two.Case 3: One even and one odd.Their difference is |even - odd| = odd. So, replacing an even and an odd with an odd. The number of odd numbers remains the same (since we removed one even and one odd, and added one odd: net change is -1 even, 0 odds).Wait, let's compute:If we have an even and an odd, their difference is odd. So, we remove one even and one odd, and add one odd. So, the number of odds: before, we had O odds and E evens. After, we have (O - 1 + 1) = O odds, and (E - 1) evens.So, the number of odds remains the same.Therefore, the number of odd numbers can only change by 0 or -2 each time.Therefore, the parity of the number of odd numbers is invariant.Initially, we have 1006 odd numbers, which is even.Therefore, throughout all operations, the number of odd numbers remains even.Therefore, when only one number remains, the number of odd numbers must be even. But one number is either odd or even.If the last number is odd, then the number of odd numbers is 1, which is odd, contradicting the invariant.Therefore, the last number must be even.Therefore, the last number cannot be 1, which is odd.Therefore, the answer is no.So, combining both invariants: the parity of the sum and the parity of the number of odd numbers, both lead to the conclusion that the last number must be even.Therefore, it's impossible for the last number to be 1.Therefore, the answer is no."},{"question":"The radius of the circle (x-1)^{2}+y^{2}=9 is _______.","answer":"To determine the radius of the circle given by the equation ((x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 9), I start by recalling the standard form of a circle's equation, which is ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2).

Therefore, the radius of the circle is 3."},{"question":"Find the solution to the Cauchy problem for the equationy^{prime} - frac{1}{x} y = -frac{2}{x^{2}}with the initial conditiony(1) = 1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve: ( y' - frac{1}{x} y = -frac{2}{x^{2}} ), and the initial condition is ( y(1) = 1 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that this is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The standard form for such equations is ( y' + P(x) y = Q(x) ). Comparing that to my equation, I see that I have a negative sign in front of the ( frac{1}{x} y ) term. So, maybe I should rewrite the equation to match the standard form.Let me rewrite it:( y' - frac{1}{x} y = -frac{2}{x^{2}} )So, in standard form, that would be:( y' + P(x) y = Q(x) )Comparing term by term, I can see that ( P(x) = -frac{1}{x} ) and ( Q(x) = -frac{2}{x^{2}} ). Okay, got that.Now, to solve this, I think I need an integrating factor. The integrating factor ( mu(x) ) is given by ( mu(x) = e^{int P(x) dx} ). Let me compute that.So, ( P(x) = -frac{1}{x} ), so:( mu(x) = e^{int -frac{1}{x} dx} )The integral of ( -frac{1}{x} ) is ( -ln|x| ), right? So,( mu(x) = e^{-ln|x|} )Hmm, simplifying that. Remember that ( e^{ln a} = a ), so ( e^{-ln|x|} = frac{1}{e^{ln|x|}} = frac{1}{|x|} ). But since we're dealing with an integrating factor, and the equation is defined for ( x > 0 ) (because of the initial condition at ( x = 1 )), we can drop the absolute value. So,( mu(x) = frac{1}{x} )Alright, so the integrating factor is ( frac{1}{x} ). Now, the method says that multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor will make the left-hand side a perfect derivative. Let's try that.Multiply both sides by ( frac{1}{x} ):( frac{1}{x} y' - frac{1}{x^{2}} y = -frac{2}{x^{3}} )Wait, let me check that. The original equation is ( y' - frac{1}{x} y = -frac{2}{x^{2}} ). Multiplying each term by ( frac{1}{x} ):First term: ( frac{1}{x} y' )Second term: ( -frac{1}{x} cdot frac{1}{x} y = -frac{1}{x^{2}} y )Third term: ( frac{1}{x} cdot -frac{2}{x^{2}} = -frac{2}{x^{3}} )Yes, that's correct.Now, according to the integrating factor method, the left-hand side should be the derivative of ( mu(x) y ). Let me verify that.Compute ( frac{d}{dx} [mu(x) y] ):( frac{d}{dx} left( frac{1}{x} y right) = frac{d}{dx} left( frac{y}{x} right) )Using the product rule:( frac{y'}{x} - frac{y}{x^{2}} )Which is exactly the left-hand side of our equation after multiplying by the integrating factor. Perfect, that checks out.So, now, the equation becomes:( frac{d}{dx} left( frac{y}{x} right) = -frac{2}{x^{3}} )Now, to solve for ( y ), I need to integrate both sides with respect to ( x ).Integrate the left side:( int frac{d}{dx} left( frac{y}{x} right) dx = frac{y}{x} + C )Integrate the right side:( int -frac{2}{x^{3}} dx )Let me compute that integral. The integral of ( x^n ) is ( frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} ) for ( n neq -1 ). Here, ( n = -3 ), so:( int -frac{2}{x^{3}} dx = -2 cdot frac{x^{-2}}{-2} + C = frac{1}{x^{2}} + C )Wait, let me double-check that:( int x^{-3} dx = frac{x^{-2}}{-2} + C = -frac{1}{2 x^{2}} + C )So, multiplying by -2:( -2 cdot left( -frac{1}{2 x^{2}} right ) + C = frac{1}{x^{2}} + C )Yes, that's correct.So, putting it all together:( frac{y}{x} = frac{1}{x^{2}} + C )Now, solve for ( y ):Multiply both sides by ( x ):( y = frac{1}{x} + C x )So, the general solution is ( y = frac{1}{x} + C x ).Now, apply the initial condition ( y(1) = 1 ).Substitute ( x = 1 ) into the general solution:( 1 = frac{1}{1} + C cdot 1 )Simplify:( 1 = 1 + C )Subtract 1 from both sides:( 0 = C )So, ( C = 0 ).Therefore, the particular solution is ( y = frac{1}{x} ).Wait, let me verify that. If ( y = frac{1}{x} ), then ( y' = -frac{1}{x^{2}} ). Plugging into the original equation:( y' - frac{1}{x} y = -frac{1}{x^{2}} - frac{1}{x} cdot frac{1}{x} = -frac{1}{x^{2}} - frac{1}{x^{2}} = -frac{2}{x^{2}} ), which matches the right-hand side of the equation. So, that's correct.Therefore, the solution is ( y = frac{1}{x} ).But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the integrating factor process, let me go through it again.Starting equation: ( y' - frac{1}{x} y = -frac{2}{x^{2}} )Standard form: ( y' + P(x) y = Q(x) ), so ( P(x) = -frac{1}{x} ), ( Q(x) = -frac{2}{x^{2}} ).Integrating factor: ( mu(x) = e^{int P(x) dx} = e^{int -frac{1}{x} dx} = e^{-ln x} = frac{1}{x} ).Multiply both sides by ( mu(x) ):( frac{1}{x} y' - frac{1}{x^{2}} y = -frac{2}{x^{3}} )Recognize the left side as ( frac{d}{dx} left( frac{y}{x} right ) ).Integrate both sides:( frac{y}{x} = int -frac{2}{x^{3}} dx = frac{1}{x^{2}} + C )Multiply by ( x ):( y = frac{1}{x} + C x )Apply ( y(1) = 1 ):( 1 = 1 + C ) implies ( C = 0 ).So, yes, the solution is ( y = frac{1}{x} ).I think that's solid. Let me just check if I can write it another way or if there's any alternative approach.Alternatively, maybe I could have used separation of variables, but since it's a linear equation, integrating factor is the standard method. I don't think separation would be straightforward here because of the ( y ) terms on both sides.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as ( y' = frac{1}{x} y - frac{2}{x^{2}} ), which is a nonhomogeneous linear equation. So, the integrating factor method is the way to go.Another thought: Maybe I can use substitution. Let me set ( v = y / x ). Then ( y = v x ), so ( y' = v' x + v ). Substitute back into the original equation:( y' - frac{1}{x} y = v' x + v - frac{1}{x} cdot v x = v' x + v - v = v' x )So, the equation becomes ( v' x = -frac{2}{x^{2}} ). Therefore, ( v' = -frac{2}{x^{3}} ). Integrate both sides:( v = int -frac{2}{x^{3}} dx = frac{1}{x^{2}} + C )Then, since ( y = v x ), we have ( y = frac{1}{x} + C x ), which is the same as before. So, that's another way to approach it, substitution. Either way, same result.So, either method leads to the same general solution, and applying the initial condition gives ( C = 0 ), so ( y = frac{1}{x} ).I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm the same solution. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The solution to the Cauchy problem is boxed{dfrac{1}{x}}."},{"question":"Given x + x^{-1} = 3, find the value of x^2 + x^{-2}.","answer":"To find the value of ( x^2 + x^{-2} ) given that ( x + x^{-1} = 3 ), I can start by squaring both sides of the equation.

Let me take them one at a time.Starting with the first problem: Given that ( x < frac{5}{4} ), find the maximum value of the function ( y = 4x - 2 + frac{1}{4x - 5} ).Hmm, okay. So, I need to maximize this function. Since it's a function of a single variable, x, I can probably use calculus here. I remember that to find maxima or minima, we take the derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then check if it's a maximum using the second derivative or some other method.First, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right:( y = 4x - 2 + frac{1}{4x - 5} )Alright, so let's compute the derivative of y with respect to x.The derivative of 4x is 4, the derivative of -2 is 0. Now, the derivative of ( frac{1}{4x - 5} ) is a bit trickier. I can rewrite that as ( (4x - 5)^{-1} ), so using the power rule, the derivative is -1*(4x - 5)^{-2} times the derivative of the inside, which is 4. So, that gives me:( frac{dy}{dx} = 4 + frac{-4}{(4x - 5)^2} )Simplify that:( frac{dy}{dx} = 4 - frac{4}{(4x - 5)^2} )Okay, so to find critical points, set this equal to zero:( 4 - frac{4}{(4x - 5)^2} = 0 )Let me solve for x. Let's move the fraction to the other side:( 4 = frac{4}{(4x - 5)^2} )Divide both sides by 4:( 1 = frac{1}{(4x - 5)^2} )Take reciprocals:( (4x - 5)^2 = 1 )Take square roots of both sides:( 4x - 5 = pm 1 )So, two cases:Case 1: ( 4x - 5 = 1 )Case 2: ( 4x - 5 = -1 )Let's solve each case.Case 1:( 4x - 5 = 1 )Add 5 to both sides:( 4x = 6 )Divide by 4:( x = frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{2} )Case 2:( 4x - 5 = -1 )Add 5 to both sides:( 4x = 4 )Divide by 4:( x = 1 )Wait, but the problem states that ( x < frac{5}{4} ). So, ( frac{5}{4} ) is 1.25, right? So, x has to be less than 1.25.Looking at the critical points, x = 3/2 is 1.5, which is greater than 1.25, so that's outside the domain we're considering. So, we can ignore that solution.The other critical point is x = 1, which is less than 1.25, so that's valid.So, x = 1 is our critical point. Now, we need to check if this is a maximum.To confirm whether it's a maximum, we can use the second derivative test.First, let's compute the second derivative.We had the first derivative:( frac{dy}{dx} = 4 - frac{4}{(4x - 5)^2} )So, the second derivative is the derivative of that. Let's compute it.Derivative of 4 is 0. The derivative of ( -4(4x - 5)^{-2} ) is:-4 times (-2)(4x - 5)^{-3} times 4.Wait, let me write it step by step.Let me denote ( u = 4x - 5 ), so the term is ( -4u^{-2} ).The derivative with respect to x is:( -4 * (-2)u^{-3} * du/dx )Which is:( 8u^{-3} * 4 )Wait, no, hold on. Wait, ( du/dx = 4 ), so:Derivative is ( -4 * (-2)u^{-3} * 4 )Wait, that's:First, the derivative of ( u^{-2} ) is ( -2u^{-3} ), so:( frac{d}{dx} [ -4u^{-2} ] = -4 * (-2)u^{-3} * du/dx = 8u^{-3} * 4 )Wait, that would be 32u^{-3}.Wait, hold on, that seems too big. Let me double-check.Wait, no. Let's see:( frac{d}{dx} [ -4(4x - 5)^{-2} ] = (-4) * (-2)(4x - 5)^{-3} * 4 )Yes, because derivative of (4x -5)^{-2} is (-2)(4x -5)^{-3} * 4.So, multiplying all together:(-4) * (-2) * 4 * (4x -5)^{-3} = 32(4x -5)^{-3}So, the second derivative is:( frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = 32(4x -5)^{-3} )At x = 1, let's compute this.First, compute 4x -5 when x=1: 4(1) -5 = -1.So, (4x -5)^{-3} = (-1)^{-3} = -1.Therefore, the second derivative at x=1 is:32 * (-1) = -32.Since the second derivative is negative, that means the function is concave down at x=1, so it's a local maximum.Therefore, the maximum occurs at x=1.Now, let's compute the value of y at x=1.( y = 4(1) - 2 + frac{1}{4(1) -5} )Compute each term:4(1) = 44 - 2 = 2Denominator: 4(1) -5 = -1So, 1 / (-1) = -1Therefore, y = 2 + (-1) = 1.So, the maximum value is 1.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make arithmetic errors.Compute y at x=1:4*1 = 44 - 2 = 24*1 -5 = -11 / (-1) = -1So, 2 + (-1) = 1. Yep, that's correct.So, the maximum value is 1 at x=1.Alright, that seems solid.Now, moving on to the second problem: Given ( x > 0 ), ( y > 0 ), and ( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 1 ), find the minimum value of ( x + y ).Okay, so this is an optimization problem with a constraint. I need to minimize ( x + y ) subject to ( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 1 ), with x and y positive.I remember that for such problems, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since it's only two variables, maybe substitution would be easier.Alternatively, I can use the AM-GM inequality, which is often useful for these kinds of optimization problems.Let me think.First, let me write down the constraint:( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 1 )We need to express y in terms of x or vice versa, then substitute into ( x + y ) and find its minimum.Alternatively, set up using Lagrange multipliers.But since it's a two-variable problem, substitution might be straightforward.Let me try substitution.From the constraint:( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 1 )Let me solve for y in terms of x.First, subtract ( frac{1}{x} ) from both sides:( frac{9}{y} = 1 - frac{1}{x} )Then, take reciprocals:( frac{y}{9} = frac{1}{1 - frac{1}{x}} )Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, solve for y:( frac{9}{y} = 1 - frac{1}{x} )Multiply both sides by y:( 9 = y left(1 - frac{1}{x}right) )Then, divide both sides by ( 1 - frac{1}{x} ):( y = frac{9}{1 - frac{1}{x}} )Simplify denominator:( 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x - 1}{x} )So, ( y = frac{9}{frac{x - 1}{x}} = 9 * frac{x}{x - 1} )So, ( y = frac{9x}{x - 1} )Therefore, we can write ( x + y = x + frac{9x}{x - 1} )So, now, ( x + y ) is expressed solely in terms of x. Let's denote this as a function:( f(x) = x + frac{9x}{x - 1} )We need to find the minimum of f(x) for x > 1, because in the expression ( y = frac{9x}{x - 1} ), since y > 0, the denominator ( x - 1 ) must be positive, so x > 1.So, x must be greater than 1.Now, let's compute the derivative of f(x) to find critical points.First, write f(x):( f(x) = x + frac{9x}{x - 1} )Let me compute f'(x):Derivative of x is 1.Derivative of ( frac{9x}{x - 1} ): Let's use the quotient rule.Let me denote numerator as u = 9x, denominator as v = x - 1.Then, derivative is (u’v - uv’) / v².Compute u’ = 9, v’ = 1.So,( frac{d}{dx} left( frac{9x}{x - 1} right) = frac{9(x - 1) - 9x(1)}{(x - 1)^2} )Simplify numerator:9(x - 1) - 9x = 9x - 9 - 9x = -9So, the derivative is ( frac{-9}{(x - 1)^2} )Therefore, f'(x) = 1 + ( frac{-9}{(x - 1)^2} ) = 1 - ( frac{9}{(x - 1)^2} )Set derivative equal to zero to find critical points:1 - ( frac{9}{(x - 1)^2} ) = 0Move the fraction to the other side:1 = ( frac{9}{(x - 1)^2} )Multiply both sides by ( (x - 1)^2 ):( (x - 1)^2 = 9 )Take square roots:x - 1 = ±3So, two cases:Case 1: x - 1 = 3 => x = 4Case 2: x - 1 = -3 => x = -2But since x > 1, we discard x = -2.Therefore, the critical point is at x = 4.Now, we need to check if this is a minimum.Compute the second derivative.First, f'(x) = 1 - ( frac{9}{(x - 1)^2} )So, f''(x) is derivative of that:Derivative of 1 is 0.Derivative of ( -9(x - 1)^{-2} ) is:-9 * (-2)(x - 1)^{-3} * 1 = 18(x - 1)^{-3}So, f''(x) = ( frac{18}{(x - 1)^3} )At x = 4, compute f''(4):( frac{18}{(4 - 1)^3} = frac{18}{27} = frac{2}{3} )Since f''(4) is positive, the function is concave up at x=4, so it's a local minimum.Therefore, the minimum occurs at x=4.Now, compute y at x=4.From earlier, ( y = frac{9x}{x - 1} )So, plug in x=4:( y = frac{9*4}{4 - 1} = frac{36}{3} = 12 )Therefore, x + y = 4 + 12 = 16.So, the minimum value of x + y is 16.Wait, let me double-check the calculations.First, f(x) = x + 9x/(x - 1). At x=4, f(4) = 4 + (36)/(3) = 4 + 12 = 16. Correct.Also, checking the constraint: 1/x + 9/y = 1/4 + 9/12 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. Correct.So, that's consistent.Alternatively, I could have used the AM-GM inequality here.Let me try that approach as a verification.We have the constraint ( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 1 ), and we need to minimize x + y.Let me set variables to make it fit the AM-GM setup.Let me denote a = 1/x, b = 9/y.Then, the constraint is a + b = 1.We need to express x + y in terms of a and b.From a = 1/x, so x = 1/a.From b = 9/y, so y = 9/b.Therefore, x + y = 1/a + 9/b.So, we need to minimize 1/a + 9/b subject to a + b = 1, where a > 0, b > 0.This seems like a standard optimization problem where we can apply Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM.Alternatively, use Lagrange multipliers.But since I already solved it via substitution, let me try AM-GM.Let me consider the expression 1/a + 9/b.We can write this as 1/a + 9/b = (1/a + 9/b).We can think of this as the sum of two terms, and we have a constraint a + b = 1.I recall that for expressions like this, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be useful.Cauchy-Schwarz states that (u1*v1 + u2*v2)^2 ≤ (u1² + u2²)(v1² + v2²).But maybe it's more straightforward to use the method of Lagrange multipliers here.Alternatively, use the method of substitution.Since a + b = 1, we can write b = 1 - a.So, substitute into 1/a + 9/b:1/a + 9/(1 - a)Now, define f(a) = 1/a + 9/(1 - a), with 0 < a < 1.Find the minimum of f(a).Compute derivative f’(a):f’(a) = -1/a² + 9/(1 - a)²Set equal to zero:-1/a² + 9/(1 - a)² = 0Move one term to the other side:9/(1 - a)² = 1/a²Cross-multiplying:9a² = (1 - a)²Take square roots? Or expand.Expand (1 - a)²:1 - 2a + a²So, 9a² = 1 - 2a + a²Bring all terms to left side:9a² - a² + 2a - 1 = 0Simplify:8a² + 2a - 1 = 0Quadratic equation: 8a² + 2a - 1 = 0Solve for a:a = [ -2 ± sqrt(4 + 32) ] / (2*8) = [ -2 ± sqrt(36) ] / 16 = [ -2 ± 6 ] / 16So, two solutions:Case 1: (-2 + 6)/16 = 4/16 = 1/4Case 2: (-2 -6)/16 = -8/16 = -1/2But a must be positive and less than 1, so a = 1/4.Therefore, a = 1/4, so b = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.Therefore, x = 1/a = 4, y = 9/b = 9/(3/4) = 12.Thus, x + y = 16, same as before.So, that confirms the result.Alternatively, using AM-GM.Let me think.We have to minimize x + y with the constraint ( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 1 ).Let me consider variables u = x and v = y.We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since I already have two methods giving me the same answer, I think it's safe.But just for thoroughness, let me set up Lagrange multipliers.Define the function to minimize: f(x, y) = x + ySubject to the constraint g(x, y) = ( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} - 1 = 0 )The method of Lagrange multipliers says that at the minimum, the gradient of f is proportional to the gradient of g.So,∇f = λ ∇gCompute gradients.∇f = (1, 1)∇g = (-1/x², -9/y²)So, setting up:1 = λ (-1/x²)1 = λ (-9/y²)Therefore, from the first equation:λ = -x²From the second equation:λ = -y² / 9Set them equal:- x² = - y² / 9Multiply both sides by -1:x² = y² / 9So, y² = 9x² => y = 3x (since y > 0, x > 0)So, y = 3xNow, substitute into the constraint:( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{y} = 1 )But y = 3x, so:( frac{1}{x} + frac{9}{3x} = 1 )Simplify:( frac{1}{x} + frac{3}{x} = 1 )Combine terms:( frac{4}{x} = 1 )So, x = 4Then, y = 3x = 12Thus, x + y = 16, same as before.Therefore, regardless of the method, substitution, AM-GM, or Lagrange multipliers, the minimum value is 16.So, that's solid.So, summarizing:Problem 1: Maximum value is 1 at x=1.Problem 2: Minimum value is 16 at x=4, y=12.**Final Answer**(1) The maximum value is boxed{1}.(2) The minimum value is boxed{16}."},{"question":"Let  x  be a real number such that    4^{2x}+2^{-x}+1=(129+8sqrt2)(4^{x}+2^{-x}-2^{x}).    Find  10x .","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 4^{2x} + 2^{-x} + 1 = (129 + 8sqrt{2})(4^{x} + 2^{-x} - 2^{x})And I need to find the value of 10x. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I notice that the equation involves exponents with base 4 and base 2. Since 4 is a power of 2, maybe I can express everything in terms of base 2 to simplify things. Let me recall that 4 = 2^2, so 4^{x} = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}. Similarly, 4^{2x} = (2^2)^{2x} = 2^{4x}. So, substituting these into the equation, let's rewrite it:2^{4x} + 2^{-x} + 1 = (129 + 8sqrt{2})(2^{2x} + 2^{-x} - 2^{x})That looks a bit better. Now, maybe I can make a substitution to simplify the equation further. Let me let y = 2^{x}. Then, since 2^{x} = y, we can express other terms in terms of y:- 2^{2x} = (2^{x})^2 = y^2- 2^{4x} = (2^{2x})^2 = (y^2)^2 = y^4- 2^{-x} = 1/(2^{x}) = 1/ySo, substituting all these into the equation, we get:y^4 + frac{1}{y} + 1 = (129 + 8sqrt{2})left(y^2 + frac{1}{y} - yright)Hmm, okay. So now the equation is in terms of y. Let me write that out:y^4 + frac{1}{y} + 1 = (129 + 8sqrt{2})left(y^2 + frac{1}{y} - yright)This still looks a bit messy, but maybe I can multiply both sides by y to eliminate the fraction. Let's try that:Multiplying both sides by y:y^5 + 1 + y = (129 + 8sqrt{2})(y^3 + 1 - y^2)So, simplifying both sides:Left side: y^5 + y + 1Right side: (129 + 8sqrt{2})(y^3 - y^2 + 1)Hmm, so now the equation is:y^5 + y + 1 = (129 + 8sqrt{2})(y^3 - y^2 + 1)This is a fifth-degree polynomial equation, which is quite complex. Maybe I can rearrange it to bring all terms to one side:y^5 + y + 1 - (129 + 8sqrt{2})(y^3 - y^2 + 1) = 0Let me compute the right-hand side term:First, expand (129 + 8sqrt{2})(y^3 - y^2 + 1):= 129(y^3 - y^2 + 1) + 8sqrt{2}(y^3 - y^2 + 1)= 129y^3 - 129y^2 + 129 + 8sqrt{2}y^3 - 8sqrt{2}y^2 + 8sqrt{2}So, combining like terms:= (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^3 + (-129 - 8sqrt{2})y^2 + (129 + 8sqrt{2})Therefore, the equation becomes:y^5 + y + 1 - [(129 + 8sqrt{2})y^3 + (-129 - 8sqrt{2})y^2 + (129 + 8sqrt{2})] = 0Simplify term by term:= y^5 + y + 1 - (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^3 + (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^2 - (129 + 8sqrt{2}) = 0Let me write all the terms:= y^5 - (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^3 + (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^2 + y + [1 - (129 + 8sqrt{2})] = 0Compute the constant term:1 - (129 + 8sqrt{2}) = -128 - 8sqrt{2}So, the equation is:y^5 - (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^3 + (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^2 + y - 128 - 8sqrt{2} = 0Hmm, that's still a fifth-degree equation, which is tough. Maybe I can factor this somehow. Perhaps there's a common factor or a substitution that can simplify it.Looking at the coefficients, I notice that 129 and 8 are both coefficients multiplied by sqrt{2}. Maybe this suggests that y could be of the form a + bsqrt{2}, where a and b are rational numbers. Let me test this idea.Suppose y = a + bsqrt{2}. Then, maybe plugging this into the equation will help. But before that, perhaps I can look for a root of the polynomial, maybe a simple one, that could help factor it.Alternatively, maybe I can factor the polynomial as a product of lower-degree polynomials. Let me see.Looking at the equation:y^5 - (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^3 + (129 + 8sqrt{2})y^2 + y - 128 - 8sqrt{2} = 0I notice that the coefficients involve (129 + 8sqrt{2}) and -128 -8sqrt{2}. Maybe these are related to powers of some expression.Wait, 129 is close to 128, which is 2^7. Hmm, 128 is 2^7, and 129 is 128 +1. Similarly, 8 is 2^3, so 8√2 is 2^(3 + 0.5) = 2^3.5. Hmm, maybe that's not directly helpful.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of 129 + 8√2 as something squared. Let me check:Suppose (a + b√2)^2 = a^2 + 2ab√2 + 2b^2. If this equals 129 + 8√2, then:a^2 + 2b^2 = 1292ab = 8 => ab = 4So, solving for a and b:From ab = 4, b = 4/a.Substitute into first equation:a^2 + 2*(16/a^2) = 129Multiply both sides by a^2:a^4 + 32 = 129a^2Bring all terms to one side:a^4 - 129a^2 + 32 = 0Let me set z = a^2:z^2 - 129z + 32 = 0Solving this quadratic equation:z = [129 ± sqrt(129^2 - 4*1*32)] / 2Compute discriminant:129^2 = 166414*1*32 = 128So sqrt(16641 - 128) = sqrt(16513)Hmm, 16513 is not a perfect square. Let me check: 128^2 = 16384, 129^2=16641, so 16513 is between them, not a perfect square. So, this approach might not be helpful.Alternatively, maybe 129 + 8√2 is related to (something)^3? Let me see:Suppose (a + b√2)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b√2 + 3ab(2) + b^3*(2√2)= a^3 + 6ab + (3a^2b + 2b^3)√2Set this equal to 129 + 8√2:So,a^3 + 6ab = 1293a^2b + 2b^3 = 8Hmm, maybe we can find integers a and b that satisfy this.Let me try small integers for b.Let me try b=1:Then,From second equation: 3a^2*1 + 2*1 = 8 => 3a^2 = 6 => a^2=2 => a=√2, not integer.b=2:Second equation: 3a^2*2 + 2*8 = 6a^2 + 16 = 8 => 6a^2 = -8, which is impossible.b= -1:Second equation: 3a^2*(-1) + 2*(-1)^3 = -3a^2 - 2 = 8 => -3a^2 = 10 => a^2 negative, impossible.b= 1/2:Second equation: 3a^2*(1/2) + 2*(1/8) = (3/2)a^2 + 1/4 = 8 => (3/2)a^2 = 8 - 1/4 = 31/4 => a^2 = (31/4)*(2/3) = 31/6, which is not a perfect square.Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach either.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that 129 + 8√2 is (something) times (something else). Alternatively, maybe the polynomial can be factored as (y^2 + ...)(y^3 + ...), but that might be complicated.Alternatively, maybe I can assume that y is of the form 2 + √2 or something similar, given the presence of √2 in the coefficients.Let me test y = 2 + √2.Compute y^2: (2 + √2)^2 = 4 + 4√2 + 2 = 6 + 4√2y^3: y^2 * y = (6 + 4√2)(2 + √2) = 12 + 6√2 + 8√2 + 4*2 = 12 + 14√2 + 8 = 20 + 14√2y^4: y^2 * y^2 = (6 + 4√2)^2 = 36 + 48√2 + 32 = 68 + 48√2y^5: y^4 * y = (68 + 48√2)(2 + √2) = 136 + 68√2 + 96√2 + 48*2 = 136 + 164√2 + 96 = 232 + 164√2Now, let's compute the left side of the equation after substitution:Left side: y^5 + y + 1 = (232 + 164√2) + (2 + √2) + 1 = 232 + 2 + 1 + 164√2 + √2 = 235 + 165√2Right side: (129 + 8√2)(y^3 - y^2 + 1)Compute y^3 - y^2 + 1:= (20 + 14√2) - (6 + 4√2) + 1 = 20 - 6 + 1 + 14√2 - 4√2 = 15 + 10√2Multiply by (129 + 8√2):= (129 + 8√2)(15 + 10√2)Let me compute this:= 129*15 + 129*10√2 + 8√2*15 + 8√2*10√2= 1935 + 1290√2 + 120√2 + 80*(2)= 1935 + (1290 + 120)√2 + 160= 1935 + 160 + 1410√2= 2095 + 1410√2Compare to left side: 235 + 165√2Hmm, 2095 + 1410√2 vs 235 + 165√2. Not equal. So y = 2 + √2 is not a solution.Wait, but maybe I made a calculation error. Let me double-check the right side:(129 + 8√2)(15 + 10√2)= 129*15 + 129*10√2 + 8√2*15 + 8√2*10√2Compute each term:129*15: 129*10=1290, 129*5=645, so 1290+645=1935129*10√2=1290√28√2*15=120√28√2*10√2=80*(√2*√2)=80*2=160So, adding up: 1935 + 160 = 2095, and 1290√2 + 120√2 = 1410√2. So, yes, 2095 + 1410√2. That's correct.Left side was 235 + 165√2. So, not equal. So y=2 + √2 is not a solution.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing y^5. Let me check y^5 again.y = 2 + √2y^2 = (2 + √2)^2 = 4 + 4√2 + 2 = 6 + 4√2y^3 = y^2 * y = (6 + 4√2)(2 + √2) = 6*2 + 6*√2 + 4√2*2 + 4√2*√2 = 12 + 6√2 + 8√2 + 4*2 = 12 + 14√2 + 8 = 20 + 14√2y^4 = y^3 * y = (20 + 14√2)(2 + √2) = 20*2 + 20*√2 + 14√2*2 + 14√2*√2 = 40 + 20√2 + 28√2 + 14*2 = 40 + 48√2 + 28 = 68 + 48√2y^5 = y^4 * y = (68 + 48√2)(2 + √2) = 68*2 + 68*√2 + 48√2*2 + 48√2*√2 = 136 + 68√2 + 96√2 + 48*2 = 136 + 164√2 + 96 = 232 + 164√2So, y^5 = 232 + 164√2Then, y^5 + y + 1 = (232 + 164√2) + (2 + √2) + 1 = 232 + 2 + 1 + 164√2 + √2 = 235 + 165√2. That's correct.Right side was 2095 + 1410√2, which is way bigger. So y = 2 + √2 is not a solution.Hmm, maybe I should try y = 1 + √2.Compute y = 1 + √2.Compute y^2 = (1 + √2)^2 = 1 + 2√2 + 2 = 3 + 2√2y^3 = y^2 * y = (3 + 2√2)(1 + √2) = 3*1 + 3√2 + 2√2*1 + 2√2*√2 = 3 + 3√2 + 2√2 + 4 = 7 + 5√2y^4 = y^3 * y = (7 + 5√2)(1 + √2) = 7*1 + 7√2 + 5√2*1 + 5√2*√2 = 7 + 7√2 + 5√2 + 10 = 17 + 12√2y^5 = y^4 * y = (17 + 12√2)(1 + √2) = 17*1 + 17√2 + 12√2*1 + 12√2*√2 = 17 + 17√2 + 12√2 + 24 = 41 + 29√2Left side: y^5 + y + 1 = (41 + 29√2) + (1 + √2) + 1 = 41 + 1 + 1 + 29√2 + √2 = 43 + 30√2Right side: (129 + 8√2)(y^3 - y^2 + 1)Compute y^3 - y^2 + 1:= (7 + 5√2) - (3 + 2√2) + 1 = 7 - 3 + 1 + 5√2 - 2√2 = 5 + 3√2Multiply by (129 + 8√2):= (129 + 8√2)(5 + 3√2)Compute this:= 129*5 + 129*3√2 + 8√2*5 + 8√2*3√2= 645 + 387√2 + 40√2 + 24*(2)= 645 + (387 + 40)√2 + 48= 645 + 48 + 427√2= 693 + 427√2Compare to left side: 43 + 30√2. Not equal. So y = 1 + √2 is not a solution either.Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look back at the original substitution.We had y = 2^x, so y > 0. Maybe I can consider that the equation might have a solution where y is a multiple of √2 or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can let z = y + 1/y, since I see terms like y and 1/y in the equation.Wait, looking back at the equation after substitution:y^5 + y + 1 = (129 + 8sqrt{2})(y^3 - y^2 + 1)But perhaps I can write this as:y^5 + y + 1 = (129 + 8√2)(y^3 - y^2 + 1)Alternatively, maybe I can write y^5 as y^2 * y^3, and see if that helps. Let me try:y^5 = y^2 * y^3So, the equation becomes:y^2 * y^3 + y + 1 = (129 + 8√2)(y^3 - y^2 + 1)Hmm, maybe I can factor y^3 - y^2 + 1 somehow, but I don't see an obvious way.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:y^5 + y + 1 = (129 + 8√2)(y^3 - y^2 + 1)Let me move everything to one side:y^5 + y + 1 - (129 + 8√2)(y^3 - y^2 + 1) = 0As before, which leads to the fifth-degree polynomial.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this polynomial as (y^2 + a y + b)(y^3 + c y^2 + d y + e). Let me attempt that.Assume:(y^2 + a y + b)(y^3 + c y^2 + d y + e) = y^5 + (a + c)y^4 + (b + a c + d)y^3 + (a d + b c + e)y^2 + (a e + b d)y + b eSet this equal to the left side of the equation, which is:y^5 - (129 + 8√2)y^3 + (129 + 8√2)y^2 + y - 128 - 8√2So, equating coefficients:1. y^5: 1 = 1, okay.2. y^4: a + c = 03. y^3: b + a c + d = -(129 + 8√2)4. y^2: a d + b c + e = 129 + 8√25. y: a e + b d = 16. Constant term: b e = -128 -8√2So, from equation 2: c = -aFrom equation 6: b e = -128 -8√2From equation 5: a e + b d = 1From equation 4: a d + b c + e = 129 + 8√2, but since c = -a, this becomes a d - a b + e = 129 + 8√2From equation 3: b + a c + d = -(129 + 8√2), and since c = -a, this becomes b - a^2 + d = -(129 + 8√2)So, let me write down the equations again:1. c = -a2. b e = -128 -8√23. a e + b d = 14. a d - a b + e = 129 + 8√25. b - a^2 + d = -(129 + 8√2)Hmm, this is a system of equations in variables a, b, c, d, e. Let me see if I can find integer or simple fractional solutions.Looking at equation 6: b e = -128 -8√2. Hmm, that's a bit messy because of the √2 term. Maybe b and e are of the form m + n√2, where m and n are integers.Let me suppose that b = m + n√2 and e = p + q√2, so that their product is (m p + 2 n q) + (m q + n p)√2.Set this equal to -128 -8√2:So,m p + 2 n q = -128m q + n p = -8We need integer solutions for m, n, p, q.This seems complicated, but maybe we can find small integers that satisfy this.Let me try m= -8, n=0: Then, m p + 2 n q = -8 p = -128 => p=16. Then, m q + n p = -8 q + 0 = -8 => q=1.So, b = -8 + 0√2 = -8, e = 16 + 1√2 = 16 + √2.Check: b e = (-8)(16 + √2) = -128 -8√2, which matches.So, possible that b = -8, e = 16 + √2.Alternatively, maybe m= -16, n=0: Then, m p = -128 => p=8, and m q = -8 => q=0.5, which is not integer. So, not good.Alternatively, m= -4, n= something:Wait, let me stick with the first possibility: b = -8, e = 16 + √2.So, from equation 5: b - a^2 + d = -(129 + 8√2)Substitute b = -8:-8 - a^2 + d = -(129 + 8√2)So, -a^2 + d = -129 -8√2 +8 = -121 -8√2Thus, d = a^2 -121 -8√2From equation 3: a e + b d = 1Substitute e = 16 + √2, b = -8, d = a^2 -121 -8√2:a*(16 + √2) + (-8)*(a^2 -121 -8√2) = 1Expand:16a + a√2 -8a^2 + 968 + 64√2 = 1Combine like terms:-8a^2 + 16a + (a√2 + 64√2) + 968 = 1Factor √2:-8a^2 + 16a + √2(a + 64) + 968 = 1Bring constants to right:-8a^2 + 16a + √2(a + 64) = 1 - 968 = -967Hmm, this equation has both rational and irrational terms. For this to hold, the coefficients of √2 and the rational parts must separately equal zero and the constants must match.So, we have:Rational part: -8a^2 + 16a = -967Irrational part: √2(a + 64) = 0From irrational part: a + 64 = 0 => a = -64But let's check if this works in the rational part:-8*(-64)^2 + 16*(-64) = -8*4096 - 1024 = -32768 -1024 = -33792, which is not equal to -967. So, this doesn't work.Hmm, maybe my assumption that b = -8 and e = 16 + √2 is incorrect. Let me try another possibility.Alternatively, maybe b = m√2 + n, e = p√2 + q, but this might complicate things further.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the polynomial might have a factor of (y^2 - 2y + 1), which is (y - 1)^2, but let me test y=1.Plug y=1 into the equation:Left side: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3Right side: (129 +8√2)(1 -1 +1) = (129 +8√2)(1) = 129 +8√2 ≈ 129 + 11.31 ≈ 140.31Not equal, so y=1 is not a root.Alternatively, maybe y=√2.Compute y=√2.Compute y^2=2, y^3=2√2, y^4=4, y^5=4√2.Left side: y^5 + y +1 = 4√2 + √2 +1 =5√2 +1 ≈5*1.414 +1≈7.07 +1=8.07Right side: (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1)= (129 +8√2)(2√2 -2 +1)= (129 +8√2)(2√2 -1)Compute this:=129*(2√2 -1) +8√2*(2√2 -1)=258√2 -129 + 8√2*2√2 -8√2*1=258√2 -129 + 32 -8√2= (258√2 -8√2) + (-129 +32)=250√2 -97 ≈250*1.414 -97≈353.5 -97≈256.5Compare to left side ≈8.07. Not equal. So y=√2 is not a solution.Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the equation might have a solution where y satisfies y + 1/y = something, given the presence of y and 1/y in the original equation.Wait, let's go back to the equation before multiplying by y:y^4 + frac{1}{y} + 1 = (129 + 8sqrt{2})(y^2 + frac{1}{y} - y)Let me denote z = y + 1/y. Then, z^2 = y^2 + 2 + 1/y^2, so y^2 + 1/y^2 = z^2 - 2.Similarly, y^4 + 1/y^4 = (y^2 + 1/y^2)^2 - 2 = (z^2 - 2)^2 - 2 = z^4 -4z^2 + 2.But I'm not sure if this substitution will help, but let me try.Wait, in the equation, we have y^4, 1/y, and constants, as well as y^2, 1/y, and y.Alternatively, maybe I can write the equation as:y^4 +1 + 1/y = (129 +8√2)(y^2 - y +1/y)Hmm, let me write this as:y^4 +1 + (1/y) = (129 +8√2)(y^2 - y + 1/y)Let me denote w = y + 1/y. Then, as before, w^2 = y^2 + 2 + 1/y^2, so y^2 + 1/y^2 = w^2 - 2.Similarly, y^4 + 1/y^4 = (y^2 + 1/y^2)^2 - 2 = (w^2 - 2)^2 - 2 = w^4 -4w^2 + 2.But in the equation, I have y^4 +1 +1/y. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can write y^4 +1 as (y^2)^2 +1, but that might not help.Wait, perhaps I can consider that y^4 +1 = (y^2 + √2 y +1)(y^2 -√2 y +1), but let me check:(y^2 + a y +1)(y^2 + b y +1) = y^4 + (a + b)y^3 + (ab + 2)y^2 + (a + b)y +1Set this equal to y^4 +0 y^3 +0 y^2 +0 y +1, so:a + b = 0ab + 2 = 0From a + b =0, b = -aThen, ab +2 = -a^2 +2=0 => a^2=2 => a=√2 or -√2Thus, y^4 +1 = (y^2 +√2 y +1)(y^2 -√2 y +1)So, perhaps I can factor the left side as such:y^4 +1 = (y^2 +√2 y +1)(y^2 -√2 y +1)So, original equation after substitution:(y^2 +√2 y +1)(y^2 -√2 y +1) + 1/y = (129 +8√2)(y^2 - y +1/y)Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe I can write 1/y as part of the terms.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:(y^4 +1) + 1/y = (129 +8√2)(y^2 - y +1/y)But I don't see an immediate way to factor this.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that 129 +8√2 is related to (y^2 - y +1/y) in some way.Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as:(y^4 +1) + 1/y = (129 +8√2)(y^2 - y +1/y)Let me denote u = y^2 - y +1/y. Then, perhaps I can express y^4 +1 in terms of u.Compute u = y^2 - y +1/yThen, u + y = y^2 +1/ySimilarly, u + y +1 = y^2 +1/y +1Wait, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute u^2:u^2 = (y^2 - y +1/y)^2 = y^4 - 2y^3 + 3y^2 - 2y +1/y^2Hmm, that's more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that y^4 +1 = (y^2)^2 +1, which is similar to the form of a sum of squares, but I don't know if that helps.Wait, maybe I can look for a substitution where y^2 = t, then y^4 = t^2, and 1/y = 1/√t, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation is symmetric in some way, but I don't see it immediately.Wait, going back to the original substitution, y = 2^x, so maybe x is a rational number, and thus y is a power of 2. Let me test y=2.Compute left side: y^5 + y +1 =32 +2 +1=35Right side: (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1)= (129 +8√2)(8 -4 +1)= (129 +8√2)(5)=645 +40√2≈645 +56.56≈701.56Not equal.y=4:Left side:4^5 +4 +1=1024 +4 +1=1029Right side: (129 +8√2)(64 -16 +1)= (129 +8√2)(49)=129*49 +8√2*49=6321 +392√2≈6321 +554≈6875Not equal.y=1/2:Left side: (1/2)^5 +1/2 +1=1/32 +1/2 +1≈0.03125 +0.5 +1≈1.53125Right side: (129 +8√2)((1/2)^3 - (1/2)^2 +1)= (129 +8√2)(1/8 -1/4 +1)= (129 +8√2)(5/8)= (129*5)/8 + (8√2*5)/8=645/8 +5√2≈80.625 +7.071≈87.696Not equal.Hmm, maybe y=√2 +1, which is approximately 2.414.

Not equal.Hmm, this is not working. Maybe I need to consider that the equation is set up in such a way that y satisfies a specific relationship.Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as:y^5 + y +1 = (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1)Let me rearrange:y^5 = (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1) - y -1Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out y^3 from the right side:y^5 = y^2 * y^3So, maybe:y^2 * y^3 = (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1) - y -1But I don't see an immediate way to factor this.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that y^3 is a common term. Let me write:y^5 = y^2 * y^3So, the equation becomes:y^2 * y^3 + y +1 = (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1)Let me move all terms to left:y^2 * y^3 + y +1 - (129 +8√2)y^3 + (129 +8√2)y^2 - (129 +8√2) =0Factor y^3:y^3(y^2 -129 -8√2) + (129 +8√2)y^2 + y +1 -129 -8√2=0Hmm, maybe not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor y^3 - y^2 +1 from the equation. Let me see:We have:y^5 + y +1 = (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1)Let me write y^5 as y^2 * y^3, so:y^2 * y^3 + y +1 = (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1)Let me bring all terms to left:y^2 * y^3 + y +1 - (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1)=0Factor y^3:y^3(y^2 -129 -8√2) + (129 +8√2)y^2 + y +1 -129 -8√2=0Hmm, same as before.Alternatively, maybe I can factor y^3 - y^2 +1 as a factor of the left side.But I don't see an obvious way.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation is of the form:y^5 + y +1 = k(y^3 - y^2 +1), where k=129 +8√2Let me write this as:y^5 = k(y^3 - y^2 +1) - y -1Hmm, maybe I can write y^5 as y^2 * y^3, so:y^2 * y^3 = k(y^3 - y^2 +1) - y -1Let me rearrange:y^2 * y^3 -k y^3 +k y^2 -k = -y -1Factor y^3:y^3(y^2 -k) +k y^2 -k = -y -1Hmm, not helpful.Alternatively, maybe I can write this as:y^3(y^2 -k) +k y^2 -k + y +1=0But I don't see a clear factorization.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that y^3 - y^2 +1 is a factor of y^5 + y +1, but let me check:Divide y^5 + y +1 by y^3 - y^2 +1.Using polynomial division:Divide y^5 by y^3: get y^2.Multiply divisor by y^2: y^5 - y^4 + y^2Subtract from dividend:(y^5 +0 y^4 +0 y^3 +0 y^2 + y +1) - (y^5 - y^4 + y^2) = 0 y^5 + y^4 +0 y^3 - y^2 + y +1Now, divide y^4 by y^3: get y.Multiply divisor by y: y^4 - y^3 + ySubtract:(y^4 +0 y^3 - y^2 + y +1) - (y^4 - y^3 + y) = 0 y^4 + y^3 - y^2 +0 y +1Now, divide y^3 by y^3: get 1.Multiply divisor by 1: y^3 - y^2 +1Subtract:(y^3 - y^2 +1) - (y^3 - y^2 +1) =0So, the division yields y^2 + y +1 with no remainder. So, y^5 + y +1 = (y^3 - y^2 +1)(y^2 + y +1)Wow, that's a useful factorization!So, the equation becomes:(y^3 - y^2 +1)(y^2 + y +1) = (129 +8√2)(y^3 - y^2 +1)Assuming y^3 - y^2 +1 ≠0, we can divide both sides by it, getting:y^2 + y +1 = 129 +8√2So, y^2 + y +1 = 129 +8√2Thus, y^2 + y +1 -129 -8√2 =0Simplify:y^2 + y -128 -8√2 =0So, quadratic equation in y:y^2 + y - (128 +8√2)=0We can solve for y using quadratic formula:y = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +4*(128 +8√2))]/2Compute discriminant:D=1 +4*(128 +8√2)=1 +512 +32√2=513 +32√2So, y = [-1 ± sqrt(513 +32√2)]/2Since y=2^x >0, we take the positive root:y = [-1 + sqrt(513 +32√2)]/2Now, we need to compute sqrt(513 +32√2). Maybe this can be expressed as a + b√2, where a and b are integers.Let me suppose sqrt(513 +32√2) = a + b√2, where a and b are positive integers.Then, squaring both sides:513 +32√2 = a^2 + 2ab√2 + 2b^2Equate rational and irrational parts:Rational part: a^2 + 2b^2 =513Irrational part: 2ab=32 => ab=16So, we have:ab=16a^2 + 2b^2=513Let me find integers a and b such that ab=16.Possible pairs (a,b):(1,16), (2,8), (4,4), (8,2), (16,1)Let me test each pair in a^2 + 2b^2=513.1. a=1, b=16:1 + 2*(256)=1 +512=513. Yes! That works.So, sqrt(513 +32√2)=1 +16√2Wait, let me check:(1 +16√2)^2=1 +32√2 + (16√2)^2=1 +32√2 + 512=513 +32√2. Yes, correct.So, sqrt(513 +32√2)=1 +16√2Thus, y = [-1 + (1 +16√2)]/2 = (0 +16√2)/2=8√2So, y=8√2But y=2^x, so 2^x=8√2Express 8√2 as 2^3 *2^(1/2)=2^(3 +1/2)=2^(7/2)Thus, 2^x=2^(7/2) => x=7/2Therefore, 10x=10*(7/2)=35**Final Answer**The value of (10x) is boxed{35}."},{"question":"Paul makes pencils, making 100 pencils a day five days a week.

He makes 100 pencils each day and works five days a week. So, the total production is 100 pencils/day multiplied by 5 days, which equals 500 pencils.Next, I'll calculate the total number of pencils Paul had available at the beginning of the week plus the pencils he produced. He started with 80 pencils in stock, and he produced 500 pencils during the week. Adding these together gives a total of 580 pencils.Finally, I'll subtract the number of pencils Paul sold during the week from the total number of pencils he had.

Consider all remainders when divided by 3.","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out for which prime numbers ( p ), the expression ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is also a prime. The hint says to consider all remainders when divided by 3. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, I know that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, ( p ) is a prime number, and I need to check when ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is also prime.The problem suggests looking at remainders modulo 3. I remember that for any integer, when divided by 3, the remainder can be 0, 1, or 2. So, maybe I should consider the possible cases for ( p ) modulo 3 and see what that tells me about ( 22p^2 + 23 ).Let me list the possible cases for ( p ) modulo 3:1. Case 1: ( p equiv 0 mod 3 )2. Case 2: ( p equiv 1 mod 3 )3. Case 3: ( p equiv 2 mod 3 )But wait, ( p ) is a prime number. The only prime number that is congruent to 0 modulo 3 is 3 itself because any other number divisible by 3 would not be prime. So, in Case 1, ( p = 3 ). Let me check that separately.In Cases 2 and 3, ( p ) is not divisible by 3, so ( p ) is either 1 or 2 modulo 3.Let me handle each case one by one.**Case 1: ( p = 3 )**Compute ( 22p^2 + 23 ):( 22*(3)^2 + 23 = 22*9 + 23 = 198 + 23 = 221 )Is 221 a prime number? Hmm, let me check. I know that 221 divided by 13 is 17, because 13*17=221. So, 221 is not a prime number. Therefore, when ( p = 3 ), the expression is not prime.**Case 2: ( p equiv 1 mod 3 )**So, ( p ) is a prime number not equal to 3, and ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ). Let's compute ( 22p^2 + 23 ) modulo 3.First, since ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv (1)^2 = 1 mod 3 ).So, ( 22p^2 equiv 22*1 mod 3 ). But 22 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 1, so 22 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, ( 22p^2 ≡ 1*1 = 1 mod 3 ).Adding 23: 23 divided by 3 is 7 with a remainder of 2, so 23 ≡ 2 mod 3.Therefore, ( 22p^2 + 23 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3 ).So, ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is divisible by 3. Since it's greater than 3 (because ( p ) is at least 2, so ( 22*4 + 23 = 88 + 23 = 111 ), which is greater than 3), it cannot be prime. Therefore, in this case, the expression is not prime.**Case 3: ( p equiv 2 mod 3 )**Similarly, ( p ) is a prime number not equal to 3, and ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ). Let's compute ( 22p^2 + 23 ) modulo 3.Since ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), ( p^2 equiv (2)^2 = 4 ≡ 1 mod 3 ).So, ( 22p^2 ≡ 22*1 ≡ 1 mod 3 ), just like in Case 2.Adding 23: 23 ≡ 2 mod 3, so ( 22p^2 + 23 ≡ 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3 ).Again, ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, so it's not prime.Wait, so in both Cases 2 and 3, regardless of whether ( p ) is 1 or 2 modulo 3, the expression ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is divisible by 3 and hence not prime. The only case left is when ( p = 3 ), which we already saw gives 221, which is not prime.So, does that mean there are no prime numbers ( p ) for which ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is also prime?But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.Wait, perhaps I should test some small primes to see if any of them satisfy the condition.Let me try ( p = 2 ):( 22*(2)^2 + 23 = 22*4 + 23 = 88 + 23 = 111 ). 111 is divisible by 3 (since 1+1+1=3), so 111 is not prime.Next, ( p = 5 ):( 22*(5)^2 + 23 = 22*25 + 23 = 550 + 23 = 573 ). 573 divided by 3 is 191, so 573 is not prime.( p = 7 ):( 22*(7)^2 + 23 = 22*49 + 23 = 1078 + 23 = 1101 ). 1101 divided by 3 is 367, so not prime.( p = 11 ):( 22*(11)^2 + 23 = 22*121 + 23 = 2662 + 23 = 2685 ). 2685 divided by 5 is 537, so it's not prime.Wait, all these results are divisible by 3 or 5, but the modulo 3 analysis suggested that all primes except 3 would result in the expression being divisible by 3, hence composite. And 3 itself gives 221, which is composite.So, does that mean there are no primes ( p ) such that ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is prime?But let me check ( p = 1 ). Wait, 1 is not a prime number, so that's irrelevant.Wait, maybe I should check ( p = 0 ) or negative primes? But primes are positive integers greater than 1, so negative numbers and 0 are out of the question.So, based on the modulo 3 analysis and testing small primes, it seems that for all prime numbers ( p ), ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is divisible by 3 and hence not prime, except when ( p = 3 ), which gives 221, which is also not prime.Therefore, there are no prime numbers ( p ) for which ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is also prime.Wait, but the problem says \\"Consider all remainders when divided by 3.\\" So, perhaps I need to formalize this.Let me write it out:For any prime ( p ), ( p ) can be congruent to 0, 1, or 2 mod 3.- If ( p equiv 0 mod 3 ), then ( p = 3 ), and ( 22p^2 + 23 = 221 ), which is not prime.- If ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 3 ), so ( 22p^2 + 23 equiv 22*1 + 23 equiv 1 + 2 = 0 mod 3 ). Hence, divisible by 3, not prime.- If ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 mod 3 ), so ( 22p^2 + 23 equiv 22*1 + 23 equiv 1 + 2 = 0 mod 3 ). Again, divisible by 3, not prime.Therefore, in all cases, ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is divisible by 3 and greater than 3, hence composite. Therefore, there are no primes ( p ) for which ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is also prime.Wait, but the problem is asking \\"for which prime numbers ( p )\\", so maybe the answer is none? Or perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.Let me double-check with ( p = 3 ):( 22*(3)^2 + 23 = 22*9 + 23 = 198 + 23 = 221 ). As I thought earlier, 221 is 13*17, so composite.Another test: ( p = 7 ), which is 1 mod 3:( 22*49 + 23 = 1078 + 23 = 1101 ). 1101 divided by 3 is 367, so composite.( p = 5 ), which is 2 mod 3:( 22*25 + 23 = 550 + 23 = 573 ). 573 divided by 3 is 191, composite.So, yeah, seems consistent.Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no prime numbers ( p ) for which ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is also prime.**Final Answer**There are no such prime numbers. The final answer is boxed{}.Wait, hold on, the problem says \\"Consider all remainders when divided by 3.\\" Maybe I need to present the answer as \\"no solution\\" or something. But in the format, it says to put the final answer within boxed{}.Hmm, maybe the answer is that there are no primes ( p ) satisfying the condition, so the box should be empty? Or perhaps state that no such primes exist.But in the instructions, it says \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\". Maybe I need to write boxed{0} or something, but 0 isn't a prime.Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there are no primes, so the box is empty. But usually, in math problems, if there's no solution, you might write \\"No solution\\" or something. But since the instructions specify to put the final answer in a box, maybe I should write boxed{text{None}}.But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the modulo 3 analysis.Wait, let me think again.If ( p equiv 0 mod 3 ), then ( p = 3 ), which gives 221, composite.If ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 3 ), so ( 22p^2 + 23 equiv 22 + 23 equiv 45 equiv 0 mod 3 ).If ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 mod 3 ), same as above.So, in all cases, ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is divisible by 3, hence composite, unless the expression equals 3. But ( 22p^2 + 23 = 3 ) implies ( 22p^2 = -20 ), which is impossible because ( p^2 ) is positive.Therefore, indeed, there are no primes ( p ) such that ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is prime.So, the answer is that there are no such primes. But how to represent that in a box? Maybe boxed{emptyset} to denote the empty set, but I'm not sure if that's standard.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to write \\"There are no such primes\\" inside the box, but the instructions say \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\", which usually expects a mathematical expression.Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply that no primes satisfy the condition, so the box is empty. But I think in some contexts, people use boxed{0} to indicate no solutions, but that might not be appropriate here.Wait, perhaps I should check if ( p = 2 ) gives a prime:( 22*(2)^2 + 23 = 22*4 + 23 = 88 + 23 = 111 ). 111 is 3*37, composite.( p = 3 ): 221, composite.( p = 5 ): 573, composite.( p = 7 ): 1101, composite.( p = 11 ): 2685, composite.So, yeah, all composite.Therefore, the answer is that there are no primes ( p ) for which ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is prime. So, in the box, I can write boxed{text{None}}.But I'm not sure if that's the standard way. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to write that no such primes exist, but in the box.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply boxed{0}, but that might not make sense.Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that the only possible prime is when ( p = 2 ), but 111 is composite. So, yeah, no primes.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the modulo calculation.Wait, let me re-examine the modulo 3 calculation.If ( p equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 3 ). So, ( 22p^2 equiv 22*1 equiv 1 mod 3 ) (since 22 divided by 3 is 7 with remainder 1). Then, 23 is 2 mod 3. So, 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 0 mod 3.Similarly, if ( p equiv 2 mod 3 ), ( p^2 equiv 4 ≡ 1 mod 3 ). So, same result.So, yes, in both cases, the expression is 0 mod 3, hence divisible by 3.Therefore, unless the expression is equal to 3, it's composite. But ( 22p^2 + 23 = 3 ) implies ( 22p^2 = -20 ), which is impossible because ( p^2 ) is positive. Therefore, no solutions.So, the conclusion is that there are no primes ( p ) such that ( 22p^2 + 23 ) is prime.Therefore, the final answer is that there are no such primes. Since the instructions say to put the final answer within a box, and typically in such problems, if there's no solution, you might write boxed{emptyset} or state \\"No solution\\" inside the box. However, since the problem is about primes, and the answer is that no primes satisfy the condition, I think the appropriate way is to state that there are no such primes. But since the box is usually for mathematical expressions, maybe the answer is simply boxed{0}, but that might be misleading.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to write that no such primes exist, but in the box. But I think in this case, since the answer is that there are no primes, the box should be empty or indicate no solution. However, in the context of the problem, since it's asking for prime numbers ( p ), and there are none, I think the answer is that there are no such primes, so I can write boxed{text{None}}.But I'm not entirely sure if that's the standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to write that the only possible prime is 3, but 221 is composite, so no primes. Therefore, the answer is none.So, I think the final answer is that there are no such primes, so I can write boxed{text{None}}.**Final Answer**boxed{text{None}}"},{"question":"Calculate: sqrt[3]{-8}+sqrt{9}=____.","answer":"To solve the expression √[3]{-8} + √9, I'll start by evaluating each term separately.First, the cube root of -8.

Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that the variance of the data set a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄, a₅ is 1. Then, it's asking for the variance of the data set where each term is multiplied by 2: 2a₁, 2a₂, 2a₃, 2a₄, 2a₅. Hmm, I think I remember something about how multiplying each data point by a constant affects the variance, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall.First, variance is a measure of how spread out the numbers in a data set are. It's calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. So, if we have a data set, we find the mean, subtract the mean from each data point, square those differences, and then take the average of those squared differences. That gives us the variance.Now, if we multiply each data point by a constant, say 2 in this case, how does that affect the variance? I think it has something to do with scaling. Let me think. If you multiply each number by 2, the spread of the data should increase, right? Because each data point is now twice as far from the mean as it was before. So, the variance should increase as well.But by how much? Is it just multiplied by 2? Or is it squared? Wait, I think it's squared. Because variance is related to the square of the deviations from the mean. So, if each deviation is multiplied by 2, then the square of each deviation would be multiplied by 4. Therefore, the variance should be multiplied by 4.Let me try to write this out more formally to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's denote the original data set as X = {a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄, a₅}. The variance of X is given as 1. Now, the new data set Y is {2a₁, 2a₂, 2a₃, 2a₄, 2a₅}. I need to find the variance of Y.First, let's recall the formula for variance. For a data set with mean μ, the variance σ² is:σ² = (1/n) * Σ(x_i - μ)²Where n is the number of data points, and x_i are the individual data points.So, for the original data set X, the variance is 1. Let's denote the mean of X as μ_X. Then,1 = (1/5) * Σ(a_i - μ_X)²Now, for the new data set Y, each data point is 2a_i. Let's find the mean of Y, which I'll denote as μ_Y.μ_Y = (1/5) * Σ(2a_i) = (2/5) * Σa_i = 2 * (1/5) * Σa_i = 2μ_XSo, the mean of Y is twice the mean of X.Now, let's compute the variance of Y. Using the variance formula again,σ_Y² = (1/5) * Σ(y_i - μ_Y)²But y_i = 2a_i and μ_Y = 2μ_X, so substituting,σ_Y² = (1/5) * Σ(2a_i - 2μ_X)²Factor out the 2,σ_Y² = (1/5) * Σ[2(a_i - μ_X)]²Which is,σ_Y² = (1/5) * Σ4(a_i - μ_X)²Because [2(a_i - μ_X)]² = 4(a_i - μ_X)²So, that simplifies to,σ_Y² = (4/5) * Σ(a_i - μ_X)²But from the original variance, we know that (1/5) * Σ(a_i - μ_X)² = 1. Therefore,Σ(a_i - μ_X)² = 5 * 1 = 5Substituting back into the equation for σ_Y²,σ_Y² = (4/5) * 5 = 4So, the variance of the new data set Y is 4.Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by noting that variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean. Then, when each data point is multiplied by 2, the mean also gets multiplied by 2. The deviations from the new mean are also multiplied by 2, so when we square them, they become 4 times the original squared deviations. Therefore, the average of these squared deviations, which is the variance, becomes 4 times the original variance. Since the original variance was 1, the new variance is 4. That seems consistent.Alternatively, I remember there's a property in statistics that says if you multiply each data point by a constant k, the variance becomes k² times the original variance. So, in this case, k is 2, so variance becomes 2² * 1 = 4. That matches what I calculated earlier.I think that's solid. So, the variance of the new data set is 4.**Final Answer**The variance of the data 2a_{1}, 2a_{2}, 2a_{3}, 2a_{4}, 2a_{5} is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Compute begin{pmatrix} 2 & - 1  - 3 & 4 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 3  - 1 end{pmatrix}.","answer":"First, I need to multiply the given 2x2 matrix by the 2x1 vector.

This is done by multiplying the elements of the first row of the matrix by the corresponding elements of the vector and then adding them together. So, 2 multiplied by 3 is 6, and -1 multiplied by -1 is 1. Adding these gives 7.Next, I'll calculate the second element of the resulting vector. This involves multiplying the elements of the second row of the matrix by the corresponding elements of the vector and then adding them together.

It says that S is symmetric about the origin, both coordinate axes, and the line y = x. They tell me that the point (2, 3) is in S, and I need to figure out the smallest number of points that S can have. The options are 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. Hmm, okay.First, let me make sure I understand what each symmetry means. Symmetric about the origin means that if a point (a, b) is in S, then the point (-a, -b) is also in S. So, for example, if (2, 3) is in S, then (-2, -3) must also be in S.Next, symmetric about the coordinate axes. That should mean two things: symmetric about the x-axis and symmetric about the y-axis. Symmetric about the x-axis implies that if (a, b) is in S, then (a, -b) is also in S. Similarly, symmetric about the y-axis means that if (a, b) is in S, then (-a, b) is also in S. So, starting with (2, 3), we can generate more points by reflecting over the x-axis and y-axis.Lastly, symmetric about the line y = x. That means if (a, b) is in S, then (b, a) must also be in S. So, if we have (2, 3), then (3, 2) should also be in S.Okay, so let's start with the given point (2, 3). Let me list all the points that must be in S because of each symmetry.1. Starting with (2, 3).2. Symmetric about the x-axis: (2, -3).3. Symmetric about the y-axis: (-2, 3).4. Symmetric about the origin: (-2, -3).5. Symmetric about y = x: (3, 2).Now, with the point (3, 2) added, we need to apply all the symmetries again to this new point.6. Symmetric about the x-axis: (3, -2).7. Symmetric about the y-axis: (-3, 2).8. Symmetric about the origin: (-3, -2).9. Symmetric about y = x: (2, 3). Wait, that's our original point, so we don't get a new point here.So, starting from (2, 3), we get the points: (2, 3), (2, -3), (-2, 3), (-2, -3), (3, 2), (3, -2), (-3, 2), (-3, -2). That's 8 points.But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other symmetries or points. Each time I apply a symmetry, I have to check if it leads to a new point or not. So, let's see:- Starting with (2, 3), reflecting over x-axis gives (2, -3), which is new.- Reflecting (2, 3) over y-axis gives (-2, 3), which is new.- Reflecting (2, 3) over the origin gives (-2, -3), which is new.- Reflecting (2, 3) over y = x gives (3, 2), which is new.Now, with (3, 2), reflecting over x-axis gives (3, -2), which is new.Reflecting (3, 2) over y-axis gives (-3, 2), which is new.Reflecting (3, 2) over the origin gives (-3, -2), which is new.Reflecting (3, 2) over y = x gives (2, 3), which we already have.So, from (2, 3), we generate 7 new points, but since (2, 3) was already there, we have a total of 8 distinct points.Let me check if any of these points, when subjected to the symmetries, produce another point not already in the list.Take (2, -3). Reflecting over x-axis gives (2, 3), which is already there. Reflecting over y-axis gives (-2, -3), which is already there. Reflecting over the origin gives (-2, 3), which is already there. Reflecting over y = x gives (-3, 2), which is already there.Similarly, take (-2, 3). Reflecting over x-axis gives (-2, -3), which is already there. Reflecting over y-axis gives (2, 3), which is already there. Reflecting over the origin gives (2, -3), which is already there. Reflecting over y = x gives (3, -2), which is already there.Take (-2, -3). Reflecting over x-axis gives (-2, 3), which is already there. Reflecting over y-axis gives (2, -3), which is already there. Reflecting over the origin gives (2, 3), which is already there. Reflecting over y = x gives (-3, 2), which is already there.Take (3, 2). We already did this.Take (3, -2). Reflecting over x-axis gives (3, 2), which is already there. Reflecting over y-axis gives (-3, -2), which is already there. Reflecting over the origin gives (-3, 2), which is already there. Reflecting over y = x gives (-2, 3), which is already there.Take (-3, 2). Reflecting over x-axis gives (-3, -2), which is already there. Reflecting over y-axis gives (3, 2), which is already there. Reflecting over the origin gives (3, -2), which is already there. Reflecting over y = x gives (2, -3), which is already there.Take (-3, -2). Reflecting over x-axis gives (-3, 2), which is already there. Reflecting over y-axis gives (3, -2), which is already there. Reflecting over the origin gives (3, 2), which is already there. Reflecting over y = x gives (-2, -3), which is already there.So, all reflections of these points lead to points already in the set. Therefore, the set S must contain all 8 points.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way that some of these symmetries could overlap, meaning that some points are generated by multiple symmetries, so maybe we don't need all 8? Or is 8 actually the minimal number?Let me consider the group of symmetries here. The symmetries include reflections over x-axis, y-axis, origin, and y = x. So, combining these, the group is actually the dihedral group of the square, which has 8 elements: the identity, three reflections, and four rotations. But in terms of generating points, each reflection can generate new points.But in our case, each reflection over x, y, origin, and y=x will generate new points until we can't generate any more. So, starting with (2,3), reflecting over x gives (2,-3), reflecting over y gives (-2,3), reflecting over origin gives (-2,-3), reflecting over y=x gives (3,2). Then reflecting (3,2) over x gives (3,-2), over y gives (-3,2), over origin gives (-3,-2), and over y=x gives (2,3). So, that's 8 points.Is there any way that some of these points could coincide? For example, if (2,3) was on one of the axes or on y=x, but since 2 ≠ 3, it's not on y=x, and it's not on the axes either because neither coordinate is zero. So, all these reflections will produce distinct points.Therefore, the minimal number of points in S is 8.Wait, but let me double-check. The problem says \\"symmetric about the origin, both coordinate axes, and the line y=x.\\" So, does that mean that all these symmetries are required? So, S must be closed under all these symmetries. Therefore, starting from (2,3), we must include all images under these symmetries, which gives us 8 points as above.So, the answer should be 8, which is option D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Given the system of equations in terms of x and y: left{begin{array}{l}{2x+4y=20}{ax+by=1}end{array}right. and left{begin{array}{l}{2x-y=5}{bx+ay=6}end{array}right. have the same solution, then a+b=____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where two systems of equations have the same solution. I need to find the value of a + b. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down both systems to have them clear in my mind.The first system is:1. 2x + 4y = 202. ax + by = 1The second system is:1. 2x - y = 52. bx + ay = 6Since both systems have the same solution, that means the solution (x, y) satisfies both systems. So, I can solve one system to find x and y, and then plug those values into the other system to find a and b.Let me start by solving the first system. Wait, actually, the first system has two equations, but the second system also has two equations. Maybe it's better to solve for x and y using one system and then substitute into the other.Looking at the first system, equations are:2x + 4y = 20ax + by = 1And the second system:2x - y = 5bx + ay = 6Hmm, maybe I should solve the second system first because the equations seem simpler? Let me check.In the second system, the first equation is 2x - y = 5. That seems straightforward. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.Let me solve for y in terms of x from the second system's first equation:2x - y = 5So, subtract 2x from both sides: -y = -2x + 5Multiply both sides by -1: y = 2x - 5Okay, so y = 2x - 5. Now, I can plug this into the second equation of the second system, which is bx + ay = 6.Substituting y:bx + a(2x - 5) = 6Let me expand this:bx + 2a x - 5a = 6Combine like terms:(b + 2a)x - 5a = 6Hmm, so this is an equation in terms of x. But I don't know the value of x yet. Maybe I can find x from the first system.Wait, the first system also has two equations. Let me try solving the first system as well.First equation: 2x + 4y = 20Second equation: ax + by = 1I can try solving for x and y here as well. Maybe I can express x from the first equation.From 2x + 4y = 20, let's solve for x:2x = 20 - 4yx = (20 - 4y)/2x = 10 - 2ySo, x = 10 - 2y. Now, plug this into the second equation of the first system: ax + by = 1Substituting x:a(10 - 2y) + by = 1Expand:10a - 2a y + b y = 1Combine like terms:10a + (-2a + b)y = 1Hmm, so now I have an equation in terms of y. But I don't know y yet. Maybe I can find y from the second system?Wait, earlier I found that y = 2x - 5 from the second system. Maybe I can use that.From the second system, y = 2x - 5. So, if I plug this into the first system's first equation, which is 2x + 4y = 20, let's see:2x + 4(2x - 5) = 20Expand:2x + 8x - 20 = 20Combine like terms:10x - 20 = 20Add 20 to both sides:10x = 40Divide by 10:x = 4Okay, so x is 4. Then, from y = 2x - 5, plugging x = 4:y = 2*4 - 5 = 8 - 5 = 3So, the solution is x = 4, y = 3.Now that I have x and y, I can plug these into the other equations to find a and b.First, let's use the second equation of the first system: ax + by = 1Plugging x = 4 and y = 3:a*4 + b*3 = 1Which is 4a + 3b = 1Next, use the second equation of the second system: bx + ay = 6Plugging x = 4 and y = 3:b*4 + a*3 = 6Which is 4b + 3a = 6So now, I have two equations:1. 4a + 3b = 12. 3a + 4b = 6I need to solve for a and b. Let me write them down:Equation 1: 4a + 3b = 1Equation 2: 3a + 4b = 6I can use either substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.Let me multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 4 to make the coefficients of a's 12 and 12, so I can subtract them.Multiply Equation 1 by 3:12a + 9b = 3Multiply Equation 2 by 4:12a + 16b = 24Now, subtract the first new equation from the second new equation:(12a + 16b) - (12a + 9b) = 24 - 312a + 16b - 12a - 9b = 217b = 21Divide both sides by 7:b = 3Now that I have b = 3, plug this back into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use Equation 1: 4a + 3b = 1Plugging b = 3:4a + 3*3 = 14a + 9 = 1Subtract 9:4a = -8Divide by 4:a = -2So, a = -2 and b = 3. Therefore, a + b = -2 + 3 = 1.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.From the second system, I found x = 4 and y = 3. Then, plugging into the first system's second equation: 4a + 3b = 1. Plugging into the second system's second equation: 4b + 3a = 6.Then, I set up the two equations:4a + 3b = 13a + 4b = 6I multiplied the first by 3 and the second by 4:12a + 9b = 312a + 16b = 24Subtracting gives 7b = 21, so b = 3. Then, plugging back into 4a + 9 = 1, so 4a = -8, a = -2. So, a + b = 1. That seems correct.Alternatively, I can plug a = -2 and b = 3 back into the original equations to verify.First system's second equation: ax + by = 1-2*4 + 3*3 = -8 + 9 = 1. Correct.Second system's second equation: bx + ay = 63*4 + (-2)*3 = 12 - 6 = 6. Correct.So, everything checks out.

Hmm, I remember that in polar coordinates, ρ represents the distance from the origin (the pole) to a point. So, ρ = 2 should be a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin. That makes sense because in Cartesian coordinates, that would translate to x² + y² = 4. So, curve C is a circle with radius 2.Now, part (1) asks for the Cartesian equations of line L and curve C. I already think curve C is x² + y² = 4. Let me confirm that. In polar coordinates, ρ = 2 is indeed a circle centered at the origin with radius 2. So, converting that to Cartesian is straightforward: x² + y² = 2², which is x² + y² = 4. Got that down for curve C.Next, line L is given in parametric form:x = 1 - (1/2)ty = 2 + (√3/2)tI need to convert this parametric equation into a Cartesian equation. To do that, I should eliminate the parameter t. Let me solve for t from the x equation and plug it into the y equation.From the x equation:x = 1 - (1/2)tLet's rearrange this to solve for t:x - 1 = - (1/2)tMultiply both sides by -2:t = -2(x - 1)t = -2x + 2Now, substitute this expression for t into the y equation:y = 2 + (√3/2)ty = 2 + (√3/2)(-2x + 2)Let me compute that:First, distribute (√3/2):y = 2 + (√3/2)*(-2x) + (√3/2)*2Simplify each term:(√3/2)*(-2x) = -√3 x(√3/2)*2 = √3So, putting it together:y = 2 - √3 x + √3Combine the constants:2 + √3 is just a constant term. So,y = -√3 x + (2 + √3)Therefore, the Cartesian equation of line L is y = -√3 x + (2 + √3). Let me write that as y = -√3 x + 2 + √3 for clarity.So, for part (1), curve C is x² + y² = 4, and line L is y = -√3 x + 2 + √3.Moving on to part (2). It says that a transformation is applied to curve C to obtain curve C'. The transformation is:x' = xy' = 2ySo, this is a scaling transformation. Specifically, it's scaling the y-coordinate by a factor of 2. So, every point (x, y) on curve C will be transformed to (x, 2y) on curve C'.Given that curve C is x² + y² = 4, let's find the equation of curve C' after the transformation.Since x' = x and y' = 2y, we can express x and y in terms of x' and y':x = x'y = y'/2Substitute these into the equation of curve C:x² + y² = 4(x')² + (y'/2)² = 4Simplify:x'^2 + (y'^2)/4 = 4To make it look neater, we can write it as:x'^2 + (y')^2 / 4 = 4Alternatively, dividing both sides by 4:(x')² / 4 + (y')² / 16 = 1Wait, that would be an ellipse with semi-major axis 4 along the y-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the x-axis. Let me check:Original equation: x² + y² = 4 is a circle with radius 2.After scaling y by 2, the equation becomes x² + (y/2)^2 = 4. Wait, no, hold on. If y' = 2y, then y = y'/2. So substituting into x² + y² = 4 gives x² + (y'/2)^2 = 4, which is x² + y'^2 / 4 = 4.To write it in standard form, divide both sides by 4:x² / 4 + y'^2 / 16 = 1Yes, that's correct. So curve C' is an ellipse with semi-major axis 4 along the y-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the x-axis.Now, the question is asking for the number of intersection points between line L and tangent C'. Wait, actually, it says \\"the number of intersection points between L and tangent C'.\\" Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Is it the number of intersection points between L and C'? Or is it the number of tangent lines from L to C'? Wait, let me read it again.\\"Assuming that the transformation [...] is applied to curve C to obtain curve C', determine the number of intersection points between L and tangent C'.\\"Hmm, maybe it's asking for the number of intersection points between line L and the tangent lines to curve C'. Or perhaps, the number of points where L intersects C'? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again.\\"Determine the number of intersection points between L and tangent C'.\\" Hmm, maybe it's the number of points where L is tangent to C'? Or maybe the number of tangent lines from L to C'? Or perhaps it's the number of intersection points between L and C'? The wording is a bit ambiguous.Wait, the original problem says: \\"the number of intersection points between L and tangent C'.\\" So, maybe it's the number of points where L intersects the tangent lines of C'? But that would be a bit more complicated because tangent lines to C' are multiple, and L could intersect each of them at some points.Alternatively, perhaps it's a translation issue. Maybe it's supposed to be \\"the number of intersection points between L and C'.\\" That would make more sense because otherwise, it's unclear.Given that, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that it's asking for the number of intersection points between L and C'. So, line L and curve C' intersecting how many times?Alternatively, if it's asking for the number of tangent lines from L to C', that would be different. But since it says \\"the number of intersection points between L and tangent C'\\", it's a bit confusing.Wait, maybe it's the number of tangent points from L to C'? Or maybe the number of intersection points between L and C' where L is tangent to C'? Hmm.Wait, let's think. If it's the number of intersection points between L and C', then we can solve the system of equations and see how many solutions there are. If it's the number of tangent lines from L to C', that would be a different approach.Given that, perhaps I should first compute the number of intersection points between L and C', which is the transformed curve. So, let's proceed with that.So, curve C' is x² / 4 + y² / 16 = 1, which is an ellipse.Line L is given by y = -√3 x + 2 + √3.So, to find the intersection points, we can substitute y from the line equation into the ellipse equation.Let me write the ellipse equation again:x² / 4 + y² / 16 = 1Substitute y = -√3 x + 2 + √3 into this equation.So,x² / 4 + [(-√3 x + 2 + √3)^2] / 16 = 1Let me compute [(-√3 x + 2 + √3)^2] first.Let me denote A = -√3 x + 2 + √3So, A² = (-√3 x + 2 + √3)^2Expanding this:= ( -√3 x )² + (2 + √3)^2 + 2*(-√3 x)*(2 + √3)Compute each term:First term: (-√3 x)^2 = (3)x²Second term: (2 + √3)^2 = 4 + 4√3 + 3 = 7 + 4√3Third term: 2*(-√3 x)*(2 + √3) = -2√3 x*(2 + √3) = -4√3 x - 6xSo, putting it all together:A² = 3x² + 7 + 4√3 - 4√3 x - 6xSo, now plug this back into the ellipse equation:x² / 4 + [3x² + 7 + 4√3 - 4√3 x - 6x] / 16 = 1Let me simplify this equation step by step.First, write each term:x² / 4 + (3x²)/16 + (7)/16 + (4√3)/16 - (4√3 x)/16 - (6x)/16 = 1Simplify each fraction:x² / 4 = 4x² / 16(3x²)/16 remains as is.7/16 remains.4√3 /16 simplifies to √3 /4-4√3 x /16 simplifies to -√3 x /4-6x /16 simplifies to -3x /8So, combining all terms:4x² /16 + 3x² /16 + 7/16 + √3 /4 - √3 x /4 - 3x /8 = 1Combine like terms:For x² terms: (4x² + 3x²)/16 = 7x² /16For x terms: (-√3 x /4 - 3x /8). Let me get a common denominator, which is 8:-√3 x /4 = -2√3 x /8-3x /8 remains as is.So, total x terms: (-2√3 x - 3x)/8Constant terms: 7/16 + √3 /4. Let me convert √3 /4 to 4√3 /16 to have the same denominator:√3 /4 = 4√3 /16So, constant terms: 7/16 + 4√3 /16 = (7 + 4√3)/16Putting it all together:7x² /16 + (-2√3 x - 3x)/8 + (7 + 4√3)/16 = 1Multiply every term by 16 to eliminate denominators:7x² + 2*(-2√3 x - 3x) + (7 + 4√3) = 16Compute each term:7x² remains.2*(-2√3 x - 3x) = -4√3 x - 6x(7 + 4√3) remains.So, the equation becomes:7x² - 4√3 x - 6x + 7 + 4√3 = 16Combine like terms:7x² - (4√3 + 6)x + 7 + 4√3 - 16 = 0Simplify constants:7 + 4√3 - 16 = -9 + 4√3So, the quadratic equation is:7x² - (4√3 + 6)x + (-9 + 4√3) = 0Let me write it as:7x² - (4√3 + 6)x - 9 + 4√3 = 0Now, to find the number of real solutions, we can compute the discriminant D.For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, D = b² - 4ac.Here, a = 7, b = -(4√3 + 6), c = -9 + 4√3Compute D:D = [-(4√3 + 6)]² - 4*7*(-9 + 4√3)First, compute [-(4√3 + 6)]²:= (4√3 + 6)^2= (4√3)^2 + 2*(4√3)*(6) + 6^2= 16*3 + 48√3 + 36= 48 + 48√3 + 36= 84 + 48√3Now, compute 4*7*(-9 + 4√3):= 28*(-9 + 4√3)= -252 + 112√3So, D = (84 + 48√3) - (-252 + 112√3)= 84 + 48√3 + 252 - 112√3Combine like terms:84 + 252 = 33648√3 - 112√3 = -64√3Thus, D = 336 - 64√3Now, we need to determine if D is positive, zero, or negative.Compute 336 - 64√3:First, approximate √3 ≈ 1.732So, 64√3 ≈ 64 * 1.732 ≈ 110.848Thus, 336 - 110.848 ≈ 225.152Which is positive. So, D > 0, meaning there are two distinct real roots.Therefore, the line L intersects curve C' at two distinct points.Wait, but hold on, the problem says \\"the number of intersection points between L and tangent C'.\\" If it's about tangent lines, then maybe it's different. But since we've interpreted it as the number of intersection points between L and C', and we found two, that might be the answer.But just to be thorough, let me consider the other interpretation. If it's asking for the number of tangent lines from L to C', that would be a different approach. But in that case, the number of tangent lines from a point to an ellipse can be 0, 1, or 2, depending on the position of the point relative to the ellipse. But in this case, L is a line, not a point, so the concept is different.Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the number of points where L is tangent to C'. That is, how many points does L touch C' at exactly one point. But in that case, we would set the discriminant to zero and solve for conditions, but in our previous calculation, the discriminant was positive, so L intersects C' at two points, meaning it's a secant, not a tangent.Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the number of intersection points between L and C', which is two.But just to make sure, let me think again. The problem says: \\"the number of intersection points between L and tangent C'.\\" Hmm, maybe it's the number of tangent points on C' that line L has? Or perhaps the number of tangent lines from L to C'? But that's not standard terminology.Alternatively, maybe it's a translation issue, and it's supposed to be \\"the number of intersection points between L and C'.\\" Since in Chinese, sometimes the word \\"tangent\\" can be used differently.Given that, and since our calculation shows two intersection points, I think the answer is two.But just to be 100% sure, let me visualize it. Curve C' is an ellipse stretched along the y-axis, and line L is a straight line. Depending on the slope and position, it can intersect the ellipse at two points, one point, or none. Since we found the discriminant positive, it's two points.Therefore, the number of intersection points is two.**Final Answer**(1) The Cartesian equations are boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 4} for curve C and boxed{y = -sqrt{3}x + 2 + sqrt{3}} for line L.(2) The number of intersection points between L and C' is boxed{2}."},{"question":"How many pages does the book \\"Folk Tales\\" have if from the first page to the last page, a total of 357 digits were used to number the pages?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of pages in the book \\"Folk Tales\\" based on the total number of digits used for page numbering, which is 357.I'll start by calculating the number of digits used for different ranges of page numbers.1. **Pages 1 to 9 (1-digit numbers):**   - There are 9 pages.   - Each page uses 1 digit.   - Total digits used: 9 × 1 = 9 digits.2. **Pages 10 to 99 (2-digit numbers):**   - There are 90 pages (99 - 10 + 1).   - Each page uses 2 digits.   - Total digits used: 90 × 2 = 180 digits.3. **Pages 100 onwards (3-digit numbers):**   - The total digits used so far for pages 1 to 99 is 9 + 180 = 189 digits.   - The remaining digits for pages 100 and beyond are 357 - 189 = 168 digits.   - Each page from 100 onwards uses 3 digits.   - Number of pages beyond 99: 168 ÷ 3 = 56 pages.   - Therefore, the last page is 99 + 56 = 155.Thus, the book \\"Folk Tales\\" has a total of 155 pages."},{"question":"Three numbers have a mean (average) of 7.

Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that for functional equations, it's often helpful to plug in specific values for ( x ) or ( y ) to see if I can find some properties of the function ( f ). Maybe I can find if it's linear or something else.Let me try setting ( x = 0 ). That often simplifies things. So, substituting ( x = 0 ) into the equation:( f(0 + f(y)) = 0 + y + f(0) )Which simplifies to:( f(f(y)) = y + f(0) )Interesting. So ( f ) composed with itself gives a linear function. That suggests that ( f ) might be linear, but I need to confirm that.Let me denote ( c = f(0) ). So, the equation becomes:( f(f(y)) = y + c )This is a useful relation. Maybe I can use this later.Now, let's see if I can find another substitution. How about setting ( y = 0 )? Let's try that.Substituting ( y = 0 ):( f(2x + f(0)) = x + 0 + f(x) )Which simplifies to:( f(2x + c) = x + f(x) )Hmm, so ( f ) evaluated at ( 2x + c ) is equal to ( x + f(x) ). Maybe I can express ( f(2x + c) ) in terms of ( f(x) ). Let me write that down:( f(2x + c) = x + f(x) )  --- (1)I wonder if I can relate this to the earlier equation ( f(f(y)) = y + c ). Maybe if I can express ( f ) in terms of linear functions.Let me assume that ( f ) is linear. That is, suppose ( f(x) = kx + d ) for some constants ( k ) and ( d ). Let's test this assumption.If ( f(x) = kx + d ), then substituting into the original equation:( f(2x + f(y)) = x + y + f(x) )Left-hand side (LHS):( f(2x + f(y)) = k(2x + f(y)) + d = 2kx + k f(y) + d = 2kx + k(k y + d) + d = 2kx + k^2 y + k d + d )Right-hand side (RHS):( x + y + f(x) = x + y + kx + d = (1 + k)x + y + d )So, equating LHS and RHS:( 2k x + k^2 y + k d + d = (1 + k) x + y + d )Now, let's collect like terms:For ( x ): ( 2k = 1 + k ) => ( 2k - k = 1 ) => ( k = 1 )For ( y ): ( k^2 = 1 ). Since we found ( k = 1 ), this is satisfied.For constants: ( k d + d = d ). Substituting ( k = 1 ):( 1 cdot d + d = 2d = d ) => ( 2d = d ) => ( d = 0 )So, if ( f ) is linear, it must be ( f(x) = x ). Let me check if this satisfies the original equation.Substitute ( f(x) = x ):LHS: ( f(2x + f(y)) = f(2x + y) = 2x + y )RHS: ( x + y + f(x) = x + y + x = 2x + y )Yes, both sides are equal. So ( f(x) = x ) is indeed a solution.But wait, is this the only solution? I assumed ( f ) is linear, but maybe there are non-linear solutions too. Let me check.Going back to the equation ( f(f(y)) = y + c ). If ( f ) is linear, we saw that ( c = 0 ), so ( f(f(y)) = y ). But in our case, ( c = f(0) = 0 ), so that's consistent.But suppose ( f ) is not linear. Let me see if I can find more properties.From equation (1): ( f(2x + c) = x + f(x) ). Let me denote ( z = 2x + c ). Then, ( x = (z - c)/2 ). So substituting back:( f(z) = (z - c)/2 + f((z - c)/2) )Hmm, that's a recursive relation. Maybe I can use this to express ( f(z) ) in terms of ( f ) evaluated at another point.Let me write this as:( f(z) = frac{z - c}{2} + fleft( frac{z - c}{2} right) )  --- (2)This seems like a functional equation in itself. Maybe I can iterate this.Let me compute ( f(z) ) using equation (2):( f(z) = frac{z - c}{2} + fleft( frac{z - c}{2} right) )Now, substitute ( z ) with ( frac{z - c}{2} ):( fleft( frac{z - c}{2} right) = frac{ frac{z - c}{2} - c }{2} + fleft( frac{ frac{z - c}{2} - c }{2} right) )Simplify:( fleft( frac{z - c}{2} right) = frac{z - c - 2c}{4} + fleft( frac{z - c - 2c}{4} right) = frac{z - 3c}{4} + fleft( frac{z - 3c}{4} right) )Substitute back into equation (2):( f(z) = frac{z - c}{2} + frac{z - 3c}{4} + fleft( frac{z - 3c}{4} right) )Combine the terms:( f(z) = frac{2(z - c) + (z - 3c)}{4} + fleft( frac{z - 3c}{4} right) = frac{2z - 2c + z - 3c}{4} + fleft( frac{z - 3c}{4} right) = frac{3z - 5c}{4} + fleft( frac{z - 3c}{4} right) )Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Maybe if I keep iterating this, I can find a pattern.Let me denote ( z_n = frac{z - (2^n - 1)c}{2^n} ). Then, perhaps:( f(z) = sum_{k=1}^n frac{z - (2^{k} - 1)c}{2^{k+1}} + f(z_n) )But this seems too vague. Maybe another approach.Wait, let's go back to the original equation:( f(2x + f(y)) = x + y + f(x) )I can try to express this in terms of another variable substitution. Let me set ( u = 2x + f(y) ). Then, ( x = frac{u - f(y)}{2} ). Substitute back into the equation:( f(u) = frac{u - f(y)}{2} + y + fleft( frac{u - f(y)}{2} right) )Hmm, not sure if this helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can find an expression for ( f(y) ). From the equation ( f(f(y)) = y + c ), if I can invert ( f ), maybe I can express ( f(y) ) in terms of ( y ).Wait, if ( f(f(y)) = y + c ), then ( f ) is a bijection because it has an inverse function. Specifically, ( f ) is invertible since it's bijective.So, ( f ) is invertible. Let me denote ( f^{-1} ) as the inverse function of ( f ). Then, applying ( f^{-1} ) to both sides of ( f(f(y)) = y + c ):( f(y) = f^{-1}(y + c) )Interesting. So, ( f(y) ) is the inverse function of ( f ) evaluated at ( y + c ). Maybe I can use this to find a relation.Let me try to substitute ( y ) with ( f^{-1}(y) ) in the original equation. Wait, not sure.Alternatively, let me consider the original equation again:( f(2x + f(y)) = x + y + f(x) )Since ( f ) is invertible, I can apply ( f^{-1} ) to both sides:( 2x + f(y) = f^{-1}(x + y + f(x)) )Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, let's go back to equation (1): ( f(2x + c) = x + f(x) ). Let me differentiate both sides with respect to ( x ), assuming ( f ) is differentiable. Hmm, but I don't know if ( f ) is differentiable. Maybe that's an assumption I shouldn't make.Alternatively, let me try to express ( f(2x + c) ) in terms of ( f(x) ). Maybe I can find a recursive relation.From equation (1):( f(2x + c) = x + f(x) )Let me denote ( x' = 2x + c ). Then, ( x = frac{x' - c}{2} ). Substituting back:( f(x') = frac{x' - c}{2} + fleft( frac{x' - c}{2} right) )Which is the same as equation (2). So, this seems like a recursive relation where ( f(x) ) is expressed in terms of ( f ) evaluated at a point closer to zero.If I keep applying this recursively, maybe I can express ( f(x) ) as an infinite series. Let's see:( f(x) = frac{x - c}{2} + fleft( frac{x - c}{2} right) )Then,( fleft( frac{x - c}{2} right) = frac{ frac{x - c}{2} - c }{2} + fleft( frac{ frac{x - c}{2} - c }{2} right) = frac{x - 3c}{4} + fleft( frac{x - 3c}{4} right) )Substituting back:( f(x) = frac{x - c}{2} + frac{x - 3c}{4} + fleft( frac{x - 3c}{4} right) )Similarly, substitute again:( fleft( frac{x - 3c}{4} right) = frac{ frac{x - 3c}{4} - c }{2} + fleft( frac{ frac{x - 3c}{4} - c }{2} right) = frac{x - 7c}{8} + fleft( frac{x - 7c}{8} right) )So, substituting back:( f(x) = frac{x - c}{2} + frac{x - 3c}{4} + frac{x - 7c}{8} + fleft( frac{x - 7c}{8} right) )I see a pattern here. Each time, the coefficient of ( x ) is ( frac{1}{2^n} ) and the constant term is ( -frac{(2^n - 1)c}{2^n} ). So, if I continue this process infinitely, the sum would be:( f(x) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{x - (2^n - 1)c}{2^n} )But wait, this is an infinite series. Let me compute the sum:First, split the terms:( f(x) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{x}{2^n} - sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{(2^n - 1)c}{2^n} )Compute each sum separately.First sum: ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{x}{2^n} = x sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^n} = x cdot 1 = x ) since it's a geometric series with ratio ( 1/2 ).Second sum: ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{(2^n - 1)c}{2^n} = c sum_{n=1}^{infty} left(1 - frac{1}{2^n}right) = c left( sum_{n=1}^{infty} 1 - sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^n} right) )But ( sum_{n=1}^{infty} 1 ) diverges, which is a problem. So, this suggests that the infinite series approach might not converge unless the divergent parts cancel out. But since the second sum diverges, this approach might not be valid.Hmm, maybe my assumption that ( f ) can be expressed as an infinite series is incorrect. Perhaps I need another strategy.Let me recall that ( f(f(y)) = y + c ). If I can express ( f ) as a linear function, which we saw leads to ( f(x) = x ), but maybe ( c ) isn't zero? Wait, earlier when I assumed ( f ) is linear, I found ( c = 0 ). So, ( f(f(y)) = y ). But in our case, ( c = f(0) ), which for ( f(x) = x ) is indeed zero.But suppose ( f ) isn't linear. Let me see if I can find another relation.From equation (1): ( f(2x + c) = x + f(x) ). Let me differentiate both sides with respect to ( x ), assuming ( f ) is differentiable. Then:( 2f'(2x + c) = 1 + f'(x) )Hmm, that's a differential equation. Let me denote ( g(x) = f'(x) ). Then:( 2g(2x + c) = 1 + g(x) )This is a functional equation for ( g ). Let me try to solve it.Let me set ( x = 0 ):( 2g(c) = 1 + g(0) )Let me denote ( g(0) = a ). Then, ( 2g(c) = 1 + a ) => ( g(c) = frac{1 + a}{2} )Now, let me set ( x = c ):( 2g(2c + c) = 1 + g(c) ) => ( 2g(3c) = 1 + frac{1 + a}{2} = frac{3 + a}{2} ) => ( g(3c) = frac{3 + a}{4} )Similarly, set ( x = 3c ):( 2g(6c + c) = 1 + g(3c) ) => ( 2g(7c) = 1 + frac{3 + a}{4} = frac{7 + a}{4} ) => ( g(7c) = frac{7 + a}{8} )I see a pattern here. It seems that ( g((2^n - 1)c) = frac{2^n - 1 + a}{2^n} ). Let me test this for ( n = 1 ):For ( n = 1 ): ( g(c) = frac{1 + a}{2} ), which matches.For ( n = 2 ): ( g(3c) = frac{3 + a}{4} ), which also matches.For ( n = 3 ): ( g(7c) = frac{7 + a}{8} ), which matches as well.So, it seems that ( g((2^n - 1)c) = frac{2^n - 1 + a}{2^n} ). If this pattern continues, as ( n ) approaches infinity, ( (2^n - 1)c ) goes to infinity (assuming ( c neq 0 )), and ( frac{2^n - 1 + a}{2^n} ) approaches 1.So, if ( g(x) ) approaches 1 as ( x ) approaches infinity, and if ( g(x) ) is continuous, then ( g(x) = 1 ) for all ( x ). Wait, is that possible?If ( g(x) = 1 ) for all ( x ), then ( f'(x) = 1 ), so ( f(x) = x + d ), where ( d ) is a constant. Let me check if this works.Suppose ( f(x) = x + d ). Then, substituting into the original equation:( f(2x + f(y)) = f(2x + y + d) = 2x + y + d + d = 2x + y + 2d )RHS: ( x + y + f(x) = x + y + x + d = 2x + y + d )So, equating LHS and RHS:( 2x + y + 2d = 2x + y + d ) => ( 2d = d ) => ( d = 0 )Thus, ( f(x) = x ) is the only linear solution, which we already found.But earlier, I considered the case where ( f ) might not be linear. However, the differential approach suggests that if ( f ) is differentiable, it must be linear. But the problem doesn't specify differentiability, so maybe there are non-linear solutions?Wait, let's think again. From ( f(f(y)) = y + c ), if ( c neq 0 ), then ( f ) is not an involution (since ( f(f(y)) neq y )), but ( f ) is a bijection.Let me try to see if ( c ) must be zero.From equation (1): ( f(2x + c) = x + f(x) ). Let me set ( x = -c/2 ):( f(2*(-c/2) + c) = (-c/2) + f(-c/2) )Simplify:( f(-c + c) = (-c/2) + f(-c/2) ) => ( f(0) = (-c/2) + f(-c/2) )But ( f(0) = c ), so:( c = (-c/2) + f(-c/2) ) => ( f(-c/2) = c + c/2 = (3c)/2 )Now, from ( f(f(y)) = y + c ), set ( y = -c/2 ):( f(f(-c/2)) = (-c/2) + c = c/2 )But ( f(-c/2) = (3c)/2 ), so:( f(3c/2) = c/2 )Now, let's use equation (1) again. Let me set ( x = 3c/4 ):( f(2*(3c/4) + c) = (3c/4) + f(3c/4) )Simplify:( f(3c/2 + c) = 3c/4 + f(3c/4) ) => ( f(5c/2) = 3c/4 + f(3c/4) )But from earlier, ( f(3c/2) = c/2 ). So, ( f(5c/2) = 3c/4 + f(3c/4) )Wait, but I don't know ( f(3c/4) ). Maybe another substitution.Alternatively, let me use equation ( f(f(y)) = y + c ) with ( y = 3c/2 ):( f(f(3c/2)) = 3c/2 + c = 5c/2 )But ( f(3c/2) = c/2 ), so:( f(c/2) = 5c/2 )Now, from equation (1), set ( x = c/4 ):( f(2*(c/4) + c) = (c/4) + f(c/4) )Simplify:( f(c/2 + c) = c/4 + f(c/4) ) => ( f(3c/2) = c/4 + f(c/4) )But ( f(3c/2) = c/2 ), so:( c/2 = c/4 + f(c/4) ) => ( f(c/4) = c/2 - c/4 = c/4 )So, ( f(c/4) = c/4 ). Interesting.Now, let me use equation ( f(f(y)) = y + c ) with ( y = c/4 ):( f(f(c/4)) = c/4 + c = 5c/4 )But ( f(c/4) = c/4 ), so:( f(c/4) = 5c/4 )Wait, but earlier we found ( f(c/4) = c/4 ). So, ( c/4 = 5c/4 ) => ( c/4 - 5c/4 = 0 ) => ( -c = 0 ) => ( c = 0 )Ah! So, ( c = 0 ). Therefore, ( f(0) = 0 ).So, from earlier, ( f(f(y)) = y ). So, ( f ) is an involution, meaning ( f ) is its own inverse.Also, from equation (1): ( f(2x) = x + f(x) ) since ( c = 0 ).So, ( f(2x) = x + f(x) ) --- (1a)Now, let me see if I can use this to find ( f(x) ).Let me set ( x = 0 ) in (1a): ( f(0) = 0 + f(0) ), which is consistent since ( f(0) = 0 ).Let me try to express ( f(x) ) in terms of ( f(x/2) ). From (1a):( f(2x) = x + f(x) )Let me replace ( x ) with ( x/2 ):( f(x) = (x/2) + f(x/2) )So,( f(x) = frac{x}{2} + fleft( frac{x}{2} right) ) --- (3)Similarly, I can substitute ( x ) with ( x/2 ) in equation (3):( fleft( frac{x}{2} right) = frac{x}{4} + fleft( frac{x}{4} right) )Substitute back into equation (3):( f(x) = frac{x}{2} + frac{x}{4} + fleft( frac{x}{4} right) )Continuing this process, I get:( f(x) = frac{x}{2} + frac{x}{4} + frac{x}{8} + cdots + fleft( frac{x}{2^n} right) )As ( n ) approaches infinity, ( frac{x}{2^n} ) approaches 0, and since ( f ) is continuous (if it is), ( fleft( frac{x}{2^n} right) ) approaches ( f(0) = 0 ).So, the sum becomes:( f(x) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{x}{2^n} = x sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^n} = x cdot 1 = x )Therefore, ( f(x) = x ) is the solution.Wait, but I assumed ( f ) is continuous here. The problem didn't specify continuity, so maybe there are other solutions? But earlier, when I tried to assume ( f ) is linear, it led to ( f(x) = x ). Also, the relation ( f(f(y)) = y ) suggests that ( f ) is bijective, which is consistent with ( f(x) = x ).But without assuming continuity, can there be other solutions? Let me think.Suppose ( f ) is not linear. But from the equation ( f(2x) = x + f(x) ), if I can express ( f(x) ) in terms of ( f(x/2) ), and so on, it seems that the only solution is ( f(x) = x ). Because each time, the function is being expressed as a linear term plus a scaled version of itself, leading to the conclusion that it must be linear.Alternatively, let me consider the original equation again with ( c = 0 ):( f(2x + f(y)) = x + y + f(x) )Since ( f(f(y)) = y ), let me substitute ( y ) with ( f(y) ):( f(2x + f(f(y))) = x + f(y) + f(x) )But ( f(f(y)) = y ), so:( f(2x + y) = x + f(y) + f(x) )So, we have:( f(2x + y) = x + f(x) + f(y) )Hmm, this looks like a Cauchy-like functional equation. Let me rearrange it:( f(2x + y) - f(y) = x + f(x) )Let me denote ( z = 2x + y ). Then, ( y = z - 2x ). Substituting back:( f(z) - f(z - 2x) = x + f(x) )This is a functional equation in terms of ( z ) and ( x ). Let me fix ( z ) and vary ( x ).Let me set ( x = t ), so:( f(z) - f(z - 2t) = t + f(t) )This must hold for all ( z ) and ( t ). Let me consider this as a difference equation.Let me denote ( h(t) = f(z) - f(z - 2t) - t - f(t) = 0 ) for all ( z, t ).But this must hold for all ( z ), which suggests that the dependence on ( z ) must cancel out. Therefore, the term ( f(z) - f(z - 2t) ) must be independent of ( z ). That is, the difference ( f(z) - f(z - 2t) ) is the same for all ( z ).This implies that ( f ) is a linear function. Because if the difference ( f(z) - f(z - 2t) ) is the same for all ( z ), then ( f ) must be affine linear, i.e., ( f(z) = kz + d ). But since ( f(0) = 0 ), ( d = 0 ). So, ( f(z) = kz ).Let me test this. Suppose ( f(z) = kz ). Then, from ( f(f(y)) = y ):( f(f(y)) = f(k y) = k(k y) = k^2 y = y )So, ( k^2 = 1 ) => ( k = 1 ) or ( k = -1 ).But let's check if ( k = -1 ) works in the original equation.If ( f(x) = -x ), then:LHS: ( f(2x + f(y)) = f(2x - y) = -(2x - y) = -2x + y )RHS: ( x + y + f(x) = x + y - x = y )So, LHS = ( -2x + y ), RHS = ( y ). These are equal only if ( -2x = 0 ) for all ( x ), which is not true. Therefore, ( k = -1 ) is not a solution.Thus, ( k = 1 ), so ( f(x) = x ).Therefore, the only solution is ( f(x) = x ).**Final Answer**The only solution is boxed{x}.**Final Answer**The only solution is boxed{x}."},{"question":"Let (z=3+4i).

Suppose the transformations (T_1) and (T_2) correspond to matrices (M= begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0  0 & 2 end{bmatrix}) and (N= begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0  0 & 1 end{bmatrix}), respectively. Find the area of the figure obtained by applying transformations (T_1) and (T_2) to (triangle ABC) in that order.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of a triangle after applying two transformations in order. The triangle is ABC with points A(0,0), B(3,0), and C(2,2). The transformations are given by matrices M and N, which correspond to T1 and T2 respectively. First, I need to recall how transformations work with matrices. I remember that when you apply a transformation matrix to a point, you multiply the matrix by the coordinate vector of the point. So, for each point, I can represent it as a column vector and then multiply by the transformation matrix to get the new coordinates.Since there are two transformations, T1 and T2, I need to apply them in order. That means I first apply T1 (matrix M) to the triangle, and then apply T2 (matrix N) to the result. So, the overall transformation would be the product of N and M, right? Because transformations are applied from right to left. So, the combined transformation matrix would be N multiplied by M.Let me write down the matrices:M = [[1, 0],     [0, 2]]N = [[2, 0],     [0, 1]]So, the combined transformation matrix T = N * M. Let me compute that.Multiplying N and M:First row of N: [2, 0] multiplied by first column of M: (2*1 + 0*0) = 2First row of N: [2, 0] multiplied by second column of M: (2*0 + 0*2) = 0Second row of N: [0, 1] multiplied by first column of M: (0*1 + 1*0) = 0Second row of N: [0, 1] multiplied by second column of M: (0*0 + 1*2) = 2So, T = [[2, 0],        [0, 2]]Wait, that's interesting. So, the combined transformation is a scaling by 2 in both x and y directions. So, it's equivalent to scaling the original triangle by a factor of 2 in both axes.But before jumping to conclusions, let me verify if I did the multiplication correctly.M is [[1,0],[0,2]] and N is [[2,0],[0,1]]. So, N*M would be:First element: (2*1 + 0*0) = 2Second element: (2*0 + 0*2) = 0Third element: (0*1 + 1*0) = 0Fourth element: (0*0 + 1*2) = 2Yes, so T is indeed [[2,0],[0,2]]. So, that's a scaling matrix with scale factor 2 in both x and y.But wait, another thought: is the area scaling factor just the determinant of the transformation matrix? Because I remember that the determinant gives the scaling factor of the area when applying a linear transformation.So, determinant of T is (2)(2) - (0)(0) = 4. So, the area should be scaled by 4.But hold on, let me think again. Because the transformations are applied in order, T1 first, then T2. So, the combined transformation is N*M, which is T. So, the determinant of T is 4, so the area of the transformed triangle would be 4 times the original area.But before I proceed, let me calculate the original area of triangle ABC to make sure.Points A(0,0), B(3,0), C(2,2). Using the shoelace formula:Area = (1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |Plugging in the coordinates:x1=0, y1=0; x2=3, y2=0; x3=2, y3=2.So,Area = (1/2)| 0*(0 - 2) + 3*(2 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) |= (1/2)| 0 + 6 + 0 | = (1/2)*6 = 3.So, the original area is 3.If the determinant of the transformation is 4, then the transformed area should be 3*4=12. So, the area after both transformations is 12.But wait, let me double-check by actually applying the transformations step by step to each point and then computing the area.First, apply T1 (matrix M) to each point.Point A(0,0):M * [0; 0] = [1*0 + 0*0; 0*0 + 2*0] = [0; 0]. So, A remains (0,0).Point B(3,0):M * [3; 0] = [1*3 + 0*0; 0*3 + 2*0] = [3; 0]. So, B remains (3,0).Point C(2,2):M * [2; 2] = [1*2 + 0*2; 0*2 + 2*2] = [2; 4]. So, C becomes (2,4).So, after T1, the triangle has points A'(0,0), B'(3,0), C'(2,4).Now, let's compute the area of triangle A'B'C' using shoelace formula.Area = (1/2)| x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |Plugging in A'(0,0), B'(3,0), C'(2,4):= (1/2)| 0*(0 - 4) + 3*(4 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0) |= (1/2)| 0 + 12 + 0 | = (1/2)*12 = 6.So, after T1, the area is 6. That's double the original area, which makes sense because the determinant of M is (1)(2) - (0)(0) = 2, so area scales by 2.Now, apply T2 (matrix N) to the transformed triangle A'B'C'.Point A'(0,0):N * [0; 0] = [2*0 + 0*0; 0*0 + 1*0] = [0; 0]. So, A'' remains (0,0).Point B'(3,0):N * [3; 0] = [2*3 + 0*0; 0*3 + 1*0] = [6; 0]. So, B'' becomes (6,0).Point C'(2,4):N * [2; 4] = [2*2 + 0*4; 0*2 + 1*4] = [4; 4]. So, C'' becomes (4,4).So, after T2, the triangle has points A''(0,0), B''(6,0), C''(4,4).Now, compute the area of triangle A''B''C'' using shoelace formula.Area = (1/2)| x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |Plugging in A''(0,0), B''(6,0), C''(4,4):= (1/2)| 0*(0 - 4) + 6*(4 - 0) + 4*(0 - 0) |= (1/2)| 0 + 24 + 0 | = (1/2)*24 = 12.So, the area after both transformations is 12, which matches the earlier calculation using the determinant of the combined transformation matrix.Therefore, the area of the transformed figure is 12.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Since both transformations are linear, the area scaling factor is the product of the determinants of each transformation matrix.Determinant of M is 1*2 - 0*0 = 2.Determinant of N is 2*1 - 0*0 = 2.So, the total scaling factor is 2*2=4.Original area is 3, so transformed area is 3*4=12.Yep, same result.Alternatively, I could have directly multiplied the matrices and found the determinant, which was 4, leading to the same conclusion.So, all methods lead to the area being 12.**Final Answer**The area of the transformed figure is boxed{12}."},{"question":"The sequence left{a_{n}right} is defined by the conditions a_{1}=0 and a_{n+1}=sum_{k=1}^{n}left(a_{k}+1right) for n geqslant 1. Find an explicit formula for this sequence.","answer":"Okay, so I have this sequence {a_n} where a_1 is 0, and each subsequent term is defined by a_{n+1} = sum from k=1 to n of (a_k + 1). Hmm, that seems a bit recursive, but maybe I can find a pattern or an explicit formula for a_n.Let me start by writing out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.Given:a_1 = 0Then,a_2 = sum from k=1 to 1 of (a_k + 1) = (a_1 + 1) = 0 + 1 = 1a_3 = sum from k=1 to 2 of (a_k + 1) = (a_1 + 1) + (a_2 + 1) = (0 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 1 + 2 = 3a_4 = sum from k=1 to 3 of (a_k + 1) = (a_1 + 1) + (a_2 + 1) + (a_3 + 1) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7Wait, 1 + 2 + 4 is 7? Let me check that again.a_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1a_2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2a_3 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4So, sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Yeah, that's correct.a_5 = sum from k=1 to 4 of (a_k + 1) = (a_1 + 1) + (a_2 + 1) + (a_3 + 1) + (a_4 + 1) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15Hmm, 1, 2, 4, 8... that looks like powers of 2. So, a_2 = 1 = 2^1 - 1, a_3 = 3 = 2^2 - 1, a_4 = 7 = 2^3 - 1, a_5 = 15 = 2^4 - 1.Wait, so is a_n = 2^{n-1} - 1? Let me test that.For n=1: a_1 = 0, 2^{0} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0. Correct.n=2: 2^{1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1. Correct.n=3: 2^{2} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. Correct.n=4: 2^{3} - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7. Correct.n=5: 2^{4} - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15. Correct.So, seems like a_n = 2^{n-1} - 1. But wait, let me make sure that this formula actually satisfies the recursive definition given.Given that a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k + 1). Let's substitute a_k = 2^{k-1} - 1 into the right-hand side.So, sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k + 1) = sum_{k=1}^{n} (2^{k-1} - 1 + 1) = sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{k-1}That's a geometric series. The sum from k=1 to n of 2^{k-1} is equal to (2^n - 1)/(2 - 1) = 2^n - 1.So, a_{n+1} = 2^n - 1, which is equal to 2^{(n+1)-1} - 1. So yes, the formula holds.Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = 2^{n-1} - 1.But wait, let me think again. I mean, I tested it for the first few terms, and it seems to hold, but is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using recurrence relations or generating functions?Let me try to express the recurrence relation in terms of a_{n+1} and a_n.Given that a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k + 1). Let's write this as:a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + nSo, a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + n.But also, notice that a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k + (n - 1). Wait, no.Wait, hold on. Let me think.Wait, actually, from the original definition, a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k + 1) = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + n.So, we have a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + n.But also, a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k + (n - 1). Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Because a_n is defined as sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (a_k + 1). So, a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (a_k + 1) = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k + (n - 1).So, a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k + (n - 1).Therefore, from a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + n, and a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k + (n - 1), we can express sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k as sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k + a_n.So, sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k = (a_n - (n - 1)) + a_n = 2a_n - (n - 1)Wait, let me see:From a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k + (n - 1), we can rearrange to get sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k = a_n - (n - 1).Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k + a_n = (a_n - (n - 1)) + a_n = 2a_n - (n - 1).Therefore, a_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + n = (2a_n - (n - 1)) + n = 2a_n - n + 1 + n = 2a_n + 1.So, we have the recurrence relation:a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 1.That's a linear recurrence relation. Hmm, that seems simpler. So, now we can solve this recurrence.Given that a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 1, with a_1 = 0.This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 2a_n.The characteristic equation is r = 2, so the homogeneous solution is A*2^n.Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.Substitute into the recurrence:C = 2C + 1 => C - 2C = 1 => -C = 1 => C = -1.Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*2^n + (-1).Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 0.So, 0 = A*2^1 - 1 => 0 = 2A - 1 => 2A = 1 => A = 1/2.Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (1/2)*2^n - 1 = 2^{n - 1} - 1.Which matches what I found earlier by computing the first few terms. So, that's consistent.Therefore, the explicit formula for a_n is 2^{n - 1} - 1.Just to double-check, let's compute a_6 using both the recursive definition and the formula.Using the formula: a_6 = 2^{5} - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31.Using the recursive definition:a_5 = 15, so a_6 = sum_{k=1}^{5} (a_k + 1) = (0 + 1) + (1 + 1) + (3 + 1) + (7 + 1) + (15 + 1) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31. Correct.Another check: a_4 = 7, which is 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7. Correct.So, it seems solid.Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = 2^{n - 1} - 1.**Final Answer**The explicit formula for the sequence is boxed{2^{n-1} - 1}."},{"question":"To climb the stairs, Evariste can take steps of 1 stair and steps of 2 stairs. In how many different ways can he climb a staircase with ( n ) stairs?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where Evariste wants to climb a staircase with ( n ) stairs. He can take steps of 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. I need to figure out how many different ways he can do this. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.First, maybe I should start with small values of ( n ) and see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a formula. Let's try that.If ( n = 1 ), there's only one way to climb the stairs: take a single step of 1 stair. So, the number of ways is 1.For ( n = 2 ), Evariste can either take two single steps (1+1) or one double step (2). That gives us two different ways. So, the number of ways is 2.Moving on to ( n = 3 ). Let's see, he can start with a single step, and then he's left with 2 stairs. From the previous step, we know there are 2 ways to climb 2 stairs. Alternatively, he can start with a double step, leaving him with 1 stair, which has 1 way. So, the total number of ways is 2 + 1 = 3.Wait, so it seems like the number of ways for ( n = 3 ) is the sum of the number of ways for ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 1 ). That's interesting. Let me check ( n = 4 ) to see if this pattern continues.For ( n = 4 ), if he takes a single step first, he's left with 3 stairs, which we just found has 3 ways. If he takes a double step first, he's left with 2 stairs, which has 2 ways. So, the total number of ways is 3 + 2 = 5.Hmm, so it's looking like each step's number of ways is the sum of the two previous steps. That sounds familiar—it's the Fibonacci sequence!Let me verify this with ( n = 5 ). If he takes a single step first, he's left with 4 stairs, which has 5 ways. If he takes a double step first, he's left with 3 stairs, which has 3 ways. So, 5 + 3 = 8 ways. Yep, that's the Fibonacci sequence again.So, it seems like the number of ways to climb ( n ) stairs is the ( (n+1) )-th Fibonacci number. Wait, let me check the indexing here. For ( n = 1 ), we have 1 way, which is the second Fibonacci number (if we consider the sequence starting at 1, 1, 2, 3, 5...). So, actually, it's the ( (n+1) )-th Fibonacci number if we start counting from 1.Alternatively, if we define the Fibonacci sequence as ( F_1 = 1 ), ( F_2 = 1 ), ( F_3 = 2 ), ( F_4 = 3 ), ( F_5 = 5 ), etc., then the number of ways for ( n ) stairs is ( F_{n+1} ).Wait, let me think again. For ( n = 1 ), number of ways is 1, which is ( F_2 ). For ( n = 2 ), it's 2, which is ( F_3 ). For ( n = 3 ), it's 3, which is ( F_4 ). So, yeah, it's ( F_{n+1} ).But hold on, sometimes the Fibonacci sequence is defined starting from ( F_0 = 0 ), ( F_1 = 1 ), ( F_2 = 1 ), ( F_3 = 2 ), etc. In that case, for ( n = 1 ), the number of ways is 1, which is ( F_2 ). For ( n = 2 ), it's 2, which is ( F_3 ). So, in this case, the number of ways is ( F_{n+1} ) as well.So, regardless of the starting index, it seems like the number of ways is a Fibonacci number. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the ( (n+1) )-th Fibonacci number.But let me try to formalize this with a recurrence relation. Let ( W(n) ) be the number of ways to climb ( n ) stairs. Then, as we saw earlier, ( W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2) ). This is because, for the first step, Evariste can take either a single step, leaving ( n-1 ) stairs, or a double step, leaving ( n-2 ) stairs. So, the total number of ways is the sum of the ways to climb ( n-1 ) and ( n-2 ) stairs.The base cases are ( W(1) = 1 ) and ( W(2) = 2 ). Wait, hold on, earlier I thought ( W(2) = 2 ), but if we consider the Fibonacci sequence starting from ( F_0 = 0 ), then ( W(1) = F_2 = 1 ), ( W(2) = F_3 = 2 ), ( W(3) = F_4 = 3 ), and so on. So, yes, the recurrence relation holds.Therefore, the number of ways is indeed the ( (n+1) )-th Fibonacci number. So, if I can express ( W(n) ) in terms of Fibonacci numbers, that would solve the problem.Alternatively, I can solve the recurrence relation directly. The characteristic equation for the recurrence ( W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2) ) is ( r^2 = r + 1 ), which has roots ( r = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ). These are the golden ratio and its conjugate.Therefore, the general solution is ( W(n) = A left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right)^n + B left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right)^n ), where ( A ) and ( B ) are constants determined by the initial conditions.Using the initial conditions ( W(1) = 1 ) and ( W(2) = 2 ), we can set up the equations:1. ( A left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right) + B left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right) = 1 )2. ( A left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right)^2 + B left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right)^2 = 2 )Let me compute ( left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right)^2 ) and ( left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right)^2 ).Calculating ( left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right)^2 ):( frac{1 + 2sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = frac{6 + 2sqrt{5}}{4} = frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} )Similarly, ( left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right)^2 ):( frac{1 - 2sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = frac{6 - 2sqrt{5}}{4} = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} )So, plugging back into equation 2:( A left( frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} right) + B left( frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} right) = 2 )Now, we have the system of equations:1. ( A left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right) + B left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right) = 1 )2. ( A left( frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} right) + B left( frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} right) = 2 )Let me denote ( phi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) and ( psi = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} ). Then, the equations become:1. ( A phi + B psi = 1 )2. ( A phi^2 + B psi^2 = 2 )But we know that ( phi^2 = phi + 1 ) and ( psi^2 = psi + 1 ) because they satisfy the equation ( r^2 = r + 1 ).So, substituting into equation 2:( A (phi + 1) + B (psi + 1) = 2 )Which simplifies to:( A phi + A + B psi + B = 2 )But from equation 1, ( A phi + B psi = 1 ). So, substituting that in:( 1 + A + B = 2 )Therefore, ( A + B = 1 )Now, we have two equations:1. ( A phi + B psi = 1 )2. ( A + B = 1 )Let me solve for ( A ) and ( B ). From equation 2, ( B = 1 - A ). Plugging into equation 1:( A phi + (1 - A) psi = 1 )Expanding:( A phi + psi - A psi = 1 )Factor out ( A ):( A (phi - psi) + psi = 1 )Compute ( phi - psi ):( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} - frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{2} = sqrt{5} )So, equation becomes:( A sqrt{5} + psi = 1 )Solve for ( A ):( A = frac{1 - psi}{sqrt{5}} )Compute ( 1 - psi ):( 1 - frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} = frac{2 - (1 - sqrt{5})}{2} = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} = phi )Therefore, ( A = frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} )Similarly, since ( B = 1 - A ), we have:( B = 1 - frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} )Compute ( frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} ):( frac{frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}}{sqrt{5}} = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} + frac{sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} + frac{1}{2} )But maybe it's better to leave it as ( frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} ).Alternatively, let's compute ( B ) using ( B = 1 - A ) and ( A = frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} ):( B = 1 - frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} )But ( phi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ), so:( B = 1 - frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}} )Simplify:( B = 1 - frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} - frac{sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}} = 1 - frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} )Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe there's a better way.Wait, actually, since ( phi ) and ( psi ) are roots of the equation ( r^2 = r + 1 ), and we have expressions for ( A ) and ( B ), perhaps we can express ( W(n) ) in terms of ( phi ) and ( psi ).So, ( W(n) = A phi^n + B psi^n ). We have ( A = frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} ) and ( B = 1 - A = 1 - frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} ).But let me check if this is correct. Alternatively, I remember that the closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers is known as Binet's formula:( F_n = frac{phi^n - psi^n}{sqrt{5}} )Where ( F_n ) is the ( n )-th Fibonacci number, with ( F_1 = 1 ), ( F_2 = 1 ), etc.Given that ( W(n) = F_{n+1} ), then:( W(n) = frac{phi^{n+1} - psi^{n+1}}{sqrt{5}} )Which is the same as:( W(n) = frac{phi cdot phi^n - psi cdot psi^n}{sqrt{5}} = frac{phi^{n+1} - psi^{n+1}}{sqrt{5}} )So, this aligns with our earlier result where ( A = frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} ) and ( B = -frac{psi}{sqrt{5}} ). Wait, but earlier I had ( B = 1 - A ), which doesn't seem to match. Maybe I made a mistake in solving for ( A ) and ( B ).Wait, let's go back. When I set up the equations:1. ( A phi + B psi = 1 )2. ( A + B = 1 )From equation 2, ( B = 1 - A ). Plugging into equation 1:( A phi + (1 - A) psi = 1 )Which is:( A (phi - psi) + psi = 1 )We found ( phi - psi = sqrt{5} ), so:( A sqrt{5} + psi = 1 )Therefore, ( A = frac{1 - psi}{sqrt{5}} )But ( 1 - psi = 1 - frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} = frac{2 - 1 + sqrt{5}}{2} = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} = phi )So, ( A = frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} )Similarly, ( B = 1 - A = 1 - frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} )But ( frac{phi}{sqrt{5}} = frac{frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}}{sqrt{5}} = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} + frac{sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}} = frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} + frac{1}{2} )So, ( B = 1 - left( frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} + frac{1}{2} right) = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} )But ( frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2sqrt{5}} ). Wait, let's compute that:( frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2sqrt{5}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{2sqrt{5}} - frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2sqrt{5}} ), which matches.But in Binet's formula, the coefficients are ( frac{1}{sqrt{5}} ) for both ( phi^n ) and ( -psi^n ). So, perhaps my earlier approach is complicating things.Alternatively, maybe I should accept that ( W(n) ) follows the Fibonacci sequence and express it as such.Given that ( W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2) ) with ( W(1) = 1 ) and ( W(2) = 2 ), this is the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. So, it's the Fibonacci sequence offset by one.Therefore, the number of ways is the ( (n+1) )-th Fibonacci number if we consider the standard Fibonacci sequence starting from ( F_1 = 1 ), ( F_2 = 1 ), ( F_3 = 2 ), etc.Alternatively, if we define ( F_0 = 0 ), ( F_1 = 1 ), ( F_2 = 1 ), ( F_3 = 2 ), then ( W(n) = F_{n+1} ).Either way, the number of ways is a Fibonacci number. So, to express the answer, I can write it in terms of Fibonacci numbers or use the closed-form expression.But since the problem doesn't specify the form of the answer, just to find the number of ways, it's sufficient to recognize it as a Fibonacci number.Therefore, the number of different ways Evariste can climb the staircase with ( n ) stairs is the ( (n+1) )-th Fibonacci number.Alternatively, using Binet's formula, it can be expressed as:( W(n) = frac{phi^{n+1} - psi^{n+1}}{sqrt{5}} )Where ( phi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) and ( psi = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} ).But since the problem is likely expecting a combinatorial answer, recognizing it as a Fibonacci number is probably sufficient.So, in conclusion, the number of ways is the ( (n+1) )-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, the answer is ( F_{n+1} ), where ( F_n ) is the ( n )-th Fibonacci number.**Final Answer**The number of different ways Evariste can climb the staircase is boxed{F_{n+1}}, where ( F_n ) denotes the ( n )-th Fibonacci number.Alternatively, if a numerical expression is preferred, it can be written using the closed-form formula, but since the problem doesn't specify, the Fibonacci number is the most straightforward answer.**Final Answer**The number of different ways Evariste can climb the staircase is boxed{F_{n+1}}."},{"question":"The function ( f(x) ) is defined for all positive values of ( x ). It is given that ( fleft(frac{4 y + 1}{y + 1}right) = frac{1}{y} ) for any ( y > 0 ). Find ( f(3) ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where the function ( f(x) ) is defined for all positive ( x ). It's given that ( fleft(frac{4y + 1}{y + 1}right) = frac{1}{y} ) for any ( y > 0 ). I need to find ( f(3) ). Hmm, let's see how to approach this.First, I think I need to find a value of ( y ) such that when I plug it into the expression ( frac{4y + 1}{y + 1} ), I get 3. Because if I can find such a ( y ), then I can substitute it into the equation and find ( f(3) ) directly.So, let me set up the equation:[frac{4y + 1}{y + 1} = 3]Now, I need to solve for ( y ). Let's do that step by step.Multiply both sides by ( y + 1 ) to eliminate the denominator:[4y + 1 = 3(y + 1)]Expanding the right side:[4y + 1 = 3y + 3]Now, subtract ( 3y ) from both sides:[4y - 3y + 1 = 3][y + 1 = 3]Subtract 1 from both sides:[y = 2]Okay, so when ( y = 2 ), the expression ( frac{4y + 1}{y + 1} ) equals 3. That means:[fleft(frac{4(2) + 1}{2 + 1}right) = f(3) = frac{1}{2}]Wait, so does that mean ( f(3) = frac{1}{2} )? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with:[frac{4y + 1}{y + 1} = 3]Multiply both sides by ( y + 1 ):[4y + 1 = 3y + 3]Subtract ( 3y ):[y + 1 = 3]Subtract 1:[y = 2]Plugging back into the original function definition:[fleft(frac{4(2) + 1}{2 + 1}right) = fleft(frac{8 + 1}{3}right) = fleft(frac{9}{3}right) = f(3) = frac{1}{2}]Yes, that seems correct. So, ( f(3) = frac{1}{2} ).But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe express ( f(x) ) in terms of ( x ) and then plug in 3.Given:[fleft(frac{4y + 1}{y + 1}right) = frac{1}{y}]Let me denote ( x = frac{4y + 1}{y + 1} ). Then, I can solve for ( y ) in terms of ( x ) and substitute back into ( f(x) ).So, starting with:[x = frac{4y + 1}{y + 1}]Multiply both sides by ( y + 1 ):[x(y + 1) = 4y + 1]Expanding the left side:[xy + x = 4y + 1]Now, collect like terms:Bring all terms with ( y ) to one side and constants to the other:[xy - 4y = 1 - x]Factor out ( y ):[y(x - 4) = 1 - x]Solve for ( y ):[y = frac{1 - x}{x - 4}]Hmm, so ( y = frac{1 - x}{x - 4} ). Let me simplify that:[y = frac{-(x - 1)}{x - 4} = -frac{x - 1}{x - 4}]Alternatively, I can write it as:[y = frac{x - 1}{4 - x}]Either way, now that I have ( y ) in terms of ( x ), I can substitute back into the expression for ( f(x) ):[f(x) = frac{1}{y} = frac{1}{frac{x - 1}{4 - x}} = frac{4 - x}{x - 1}]So, simplifying:[f(x) = frac{4 - x}{x - 1}]Let me check if this makes sense. Let's test with ( x = 3 ):[f(3) = frac{4 - 3}{3 - 1} = frac{1}{2}]Which matches what I found earlier. So, that seems consistent.Just to be thorough, let me test another value. Let's pick ( y = 1 ). Then:[x = frac{4(1) + 1}{1 + 1} = frac{5}{2}][fleft(frac{5}{2}right) = frac{1}{1} = 1]Using the expression for ( f(x) ):[fleft(frac{5}{2}right) = frac{4 - frac{5}{2}}{frac{5}{2} - 1} = frac{frac{8}{2} - frac{5}{2}}{frac{5}{2} - frac{2}{2}} = frac{frac{3}{2}}{frac{3}{2}} = 1]Perfect, that works too. So, the expression for ( f(x) ) seems correct.Therefore, plugging ( x = 3 ) into ( f(x) ), we get ( frac{1}{2} ). So, ( f(3) = frac{1}{2} ).I think that's solid. I approached it two ways: first by solving for ( y ) such that the argument of ( f ) is 3, and second by expressing ( f(x) ) in terms of ( x ) directly. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I feel confident that ( f(3) = frac{1}{2} ).**Final Answer**The value of ( f(3) ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}."},{"question":"Josanna's test scores to date are 90, 80, 70, 60, and 85.

Let me try to understand it step by step. The sequence is {a_n}, and the common ratio q is 3. That means each term is three times the previous one. The sum of the first n terms is denoted as S_n. The problem says that S_3 + S_4 equals 53/3, and I need to find the value of a_3.First, I should recall the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence. I think it's S_n = a_1*(1 - q^n)/(1 - q), right? Since q is not equal to 1, this formula should work. Let me write that down:S_n = a_1*(1 - q^n)/(1 - q)Given that q = 3, so plugging that in, the formula becomes:S_n = a_1*(1 - 3^n)/(1 - 3) = a_1*(1 - 3^n)/(-2) = a_1*(3^n - 1)/2Wait, that simplifies to S_n = a_1*(3^n - 1)/2. Yeah, that makes sense because 1 - 3^n is negative, so dividing by -2 flips the sign.So, for S_3, it would be:S_3 = a_1*(3^3 - 1)/2 = a_1*(27 - 1)/2 = a_1*26/2 = a_1*13Similarly, S_4 would be:S_4 = a_1*(3^4 - 1)/2 = a_1*(81 - 1)/2 = a_1*80/2 = a_1*40The problem states that S_3 + S_4 = 53/3. So, substituting the expressions I found:S_3 + S_4 = 13a_1 + 40a_1 = 53a_1And this is equal to 53/3. So,53a_1 = 53/3Dividing both sides by 53:a_1 = (53/3)/53 = 1/3Okay, so the first term a_1 is 1/3. Now, I need to find a_3. In a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by the common ratio q. So, a_3 = a_1*q^2.Let me compute that:a_3 = a_1*q^2 = (1/3)*(3)^2 = (1/3)*9 = 3Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I used the sum formula correctly. For S_n, I substituted q = 3 and simplified correctly to S_n = a_1*(3^n - 1)/2.2. Calculated S_3 as 13a_1 and S_4 as 40a_1. Then, added them to get 53a_1.3. Set 53a_1 equal to 53/3, solved for a_1 as 1/3.4. Then, found a_3 by multiplying a_1 by q squared, which is 3 squared, so 9. Then, 1/3 * 9 is indeed 3.Hmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me write out the terms and compute the sums manually to verify.Given a_1 = 1/3, q = 3.So, the terms are:a_1 = 1/3a_2 = a_1*q = (1/3)*3 = 1a_3 = a_2*q = 1*3 = 3a_4 = a_3*q = 3*3 = 9Now, let's compute S_3 and S_4.S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = (1/3) + 1 + 3 = (1/3) + (3/3) + (9/3) = (1 + 3 + 9)/3 = 13/3Wait, hold on, 1/3 + 1 + 3 is 1/3 + 4, which is 13/3. Hmm, but earlier I thought S_3 was 13a_1, which is 13*(1/3) = 13/3. So that's correct.Similarly, S_4 = S_3 + a_4 = 13/3 + 9 = 13/3 + 27/3 = 40/3So, S_3 + S_4 = 13/3 + 40/3 = 53/3, which matches the given condition. So, that checks out.Therefore, a_3 is indeed 3. So, the answer should be 3.But just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors, let me go through the calculations again.Given:q = 3S_3 + S_4 = 53/3We found a_1 = 1/3Compute S_3:a_1 = 1/3a_2 = 1a_3 = 3Sum: 1/3 + 1 + 3 = 1/3 + 4 = 13/3Compute S_4:a_4 = 9Sum: 13/3 + 9 = 13/3 + 27/3 = 40/3So, S_3 + S_4 = 13/3 + 40/3 = 53/3, which is correct.Therefore, a_3 is 3. So, yeah, I think that's solid.I guess another way to approach this is by using the formula for S_n and setting up the equation S_3 + S_4 = 53/3, then solving for a_1, and then computing a_3.But since I already did that and verified, I think it's safe to say that a_3 is 3.**Final Answer**The value of (a_3) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"A train is 800 meters long. It takes 2 minutes to pass a large tree on the side of the road. The same train, traveling at the same speed, takes 5 minutes to pass over a bridge. How long is the bridge in meters?","answer":"First, I need to determine the speed of the train. The train is 800 meters long and takes 2 minutes to pass a tree. Converting 2 minutes to seconds gives 120 seconds. The speed of the train is the length of the train divided by the time it takes to pass the tree, which is 800 meters divided by 120 seconds, resulting in approximately 6.6667 meters per second.Next, I'll calculate the total distance the train travels while passing the bridge. The train takes 5 minutes to pass the bridge, which is 300 seconds. Multiplying the speed of the train by this time gives 6.6667 meters per second multiplied by 300 seconds, which equals 2000 meters.Finally, to find the length of the bridge, I'll subtract the length of the train from the total distance traveled while passing the bridge. This means subtracting 800 meters from 2000 meters, resulting in a bridge length of 1200 meters."},{"question":"The number of all sets B that satisfy the condition {1, 3} cup B = {1, 3, 5} is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"The number of all sets ( B ) that satisfy the condition ( {1, 3} cup B = {1, 3, 5} ) is ______.\\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the union of two sets ( A ) and ( B ), denoted ( A cup B ), is the set of all elements that are in ( A ), in ( B ), or in both. So, in this case, ( {1, 3} cup B = {1, 3, 5} ). That means when we take all the elements from ( {1, 3} ) and all the elements from ( B ), the result should be exactly ( {1, 3, 5} ).Let me write down what I know:- The union ( {1, 3} cup B ) must equal ( {1, 3, 5} ).- So, ( B ) must contain elements such that when combined with ( {1, 3} ), we get ( {1, 3, 5} ).Hmm, so what does this tell me about ( B )?Well, ( B ) can't have any elements that aren't in ( {1, 3, 5} ), because otherwise, the union would have extra elements. So, ( B ) must be a subset of ( {1, 3, 5} ).But also, since ( {1, 3} cup B ) must include all elements of ( {1, 3, 5} ), ( B ) must contain the element ( 5 ), right? Because ( {1, 3} ) doesn't have ( 5 ), so ( B ) must provide it.So, ( 5 ) must be in ( B ). But what about the other elements, ( 1 ) and ( 3 )?Well, ( B ) can have ( 1 ) and/or ( 3 ), or neither. Because ( {1, 3} ) already includes ( 1 ) and ( 3 ), so whether ( B ) has them or not doesn't affect the union—it will still have ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) because they're already in ( {1, 3} ).So, to recap:- ( B ) must include ( 5 ).- ( B ) can include ( 1 ) and/or ( 3 ), or neither.Therefore, the elements ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are optional in ( B ), but ( 5 ) is required.Now, how many such sets ( B ) are there?Well, since ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) can be either included or excluded independently, each has two choices: in or out. So, the number of possible combinations for ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) is ( 2 times 2 = 4 ).And since ( 5 ) must be included, we don't have a choice about that—it's fixed.Therefore, the total number of sets ( B ) is 4.Wait, let me verify that.Let me list all possible sets ( B ):1. ( B = {5} )2. ( B = {1, 5} )3. ( B = {3, 5} )4. ( B = {1, 3, 5} )So, that's four sets. Let me check each one:1. ( {1, 3} cup {5} = {1, 3, 5} ) ✔️2. ( {1, 3} cup {1, 5} = {1, 3, 5} ) ✔️3. ( {1, 3} cup {3, 5} = {1, 3, 5} ) ✔️4. ( {1, 3} cup {1, 3, 5} = {1, 3, 5} ) ✔️Yep, all four satisfy the condition. So, the number of such sets ( B ) is 4.I think that's it. So, the answer should be 4.**Final Answer**The number of all sets ( B ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"School A has 3600 students, School B has 5400 students, and School C has 1800 students.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the sum of the binomial coefficients in any binomial expansion (a + b)^n is found by setting a = 1 and b = 1. So, the sum is (1 + 1)^n = 2^n. In this case, the problem says the sum is 64. So, 2^n = 64. Let me solve for n.64 is 2^6, right? So, 2^n = 2^6 implies n = 6. Okay, so n is 6. That wasn't too bad.Now, I need to find the constant term in the expansion of (2x - 1/√x)^6. Hmm, binomial expansions can be tricky, but let's recall the general term formula. The expansion of (a + b)^n is the sum from k=0 to n of C(n, k) * a^(n - k) * b^k, where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.In this case, a is 2x and b is -1/√x. So, the general term is C(6, k) * (2x)^(6 - k) * (-1/√x)^k.Let me write that out:Term = C(6, k) * (2x)^(6 - k) * (-1/√x)^k.I need to find the term where the exponent of x is zero because that's the constant term. So, I need to find k such that the exponent of x in the term is zero.Let me compute the exponent of x in the term. The term has (2x)^(6 - k) which is 2^(6 - k) * x^(6 - k). Then, it also has (-1/√x)^k which is (-1)^k * (1/√x)^k = (-1)^k * x^(-k/2).So, combining these, the exponent of x is (6 - k) + (-k/2) = 6 - k - k/2 = 6 - (3k)/2.We need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set up the equation:6 - (3k)/2 = 0.Let me solve for k:6 = (3k)/2Multiply both sides by 2:12 = 3kDivide both sides by 3:k = 4.Okay, so the constant term occurs when k = 4.Now, let's compute that term. So, plugging k = 4 into the general term:Term = C(6, 4) * (2x)^(6 - 4) * (-1/√x)^4.Compute each part step by step.First, C(6, 4). I know that C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, C(6, 4) = 6! / (4!2!) = (720)/(24 * 2) = 720 / 48 = 15.Next, (2x)^(6 - 4) = (2x)^2 = 4x^2.Then, (-1/√x)^4. Let's compute that. First, (-1)^4 is 1. Then, (1/√x)^4 is (1/(x^(1/2)))^4 = x^(-4*(1/2)) = x^(-2). So, altogether, (-1/√x)^4 = 1 * x^(-2) = x^(-2).Now, multiply all these parts together:Term = 15 * 4x^2 * x^(-2).Simplify the exponents: x^2 * x^(-2) = x^(2 - 2) = x^0 = 1.So, the term becomes 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.Wait, but hold on a second. The term also includes (-1)^k, right? Because in the general term, it's (-1/√x)^k, which is (-1)^k * (1/√x)^k. So, when I computed (-1/√x)^4, I considered (-1)^4 which is 1, but is that correct?Yes, because (-1)^4 is indeed 1. So, the term is positive 60.But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.So, C(6, 4) is 15, correct. (2x)^2 is 4x^2, correct. (-1/√x)^4 is (1/x^2), correct. So, 15 * 4 is 60, and x^2 * x^(-2) is 1. So, yes, the constant term is 60.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the entire expansion up to the k=4 term to see if that makes sense.The expansion is:C(6,0)*(2x)^6*(-1/√x)^0 + C(6,1)*(2x)^5*(-1/√x)^1 + C(6,2)*(2x)^4*(-1/√x)^2 + C(6,3)*(2x)^3*(-1/√x)^3 + C(6,4)*(2x)^2*(-1/√x)^4 + ... and so on.So, the term when k=4 is indeed the fifth term, and as I calculated, it's 15*4*1 = 60.Wait, but hold on. Let me compute the term again step by step.C(6,4) is 15.(2x)^(6 - 4) is (2x)^2 = 4x^2.(-1/√x)^4 is (-1)^4 * (1/√x)^4 = 1 * (1/x^2) = x^(-2).So, multiplying all together: 15 * 4x^2 * x^(-2) = 15 * 4 * x^(2 - 2) = 60 * x^0 = 60.Yes, that seems correct.But just to make sure, let me compute another term to see if my process is correct. Let's take k=3.C(6,3) is 20.(2x)^(6 - 3) = (2x)^3 = 8x^3.(-1/√x)^3 = (-1)^3 * (1/√x)^3 = -1 * x^(-3/2).Multiplying together: 20 * 8x^3 * (-1)x^(-3/2) = 20 * 8 * (-1) * x^(3 - 3/2) = -160x^(3/2).So, that term is -160x^(3/2). Okay, that seems correct.Similarly, for k=2:C(6,2) is 15.(2x)^4 = 16x^4.(-1/√x)^2 = 1 * x^(-1).So, term is 15 * 16x^4 * x^(-1) = 240x^3.So, that term is 240x^3.Wait, so when k=4, we have 60, which is a constant term. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, let me think about the general term again.Term = C(6, k) * (2x)^(6 - k) * (-1/√x)^k.Simplify this expression:= C(6, k) * 2^(6 - k) * x^(6 - k) * (-1)^k * x^(-k/2)= C(6, k) * 2^(6 - k) * (-1)^k * x^(6 - k - k/2)= C(6, k) * 2^(6 - k) * (-1)^k * x^(6 - (3k)/2)So, for the exponent of x to be zero:6 - (3k)/2 = 0Multiply both sides by 2:12 - 3k = 03k = 12k = 4.So, that's correct.Therefore, the constant term is when k=4, which is:C(6,4) * 2^(6 - 4) * (-1)^4 = 15 * 4 * 1 = 60.Wait, but hold on a second. Is that all? Because in the term, we have x^(6 - (3k)/2), and when k=4, that exponent is zero, so the term is just the coefficient, which is 15 * 4 * 1 = 60. So, yes, 60 is the constant term.But let me just think again: is there another term where the exponent could be zero? For example, when k= something else?Wait, let's see. The exponent is 6 - (3k)/2. So, 6 - (3k)/2 = 0. So, k must be 4. There's no other integer k between 0 and 6 that would satisfy that equation. Because if k=5, exponent is 6 - 15/2 = 6 - 7.5 = -1.5, which is not zero. If k=3, exponent is 6 - 9/2 = 6 - 4.5 = 1.5, not zero. So, only k=4 gives exponent zero.Therefore, 60 is indeed the constant term.Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion for (2x - 1/√x)^6 and see if the constant term is indeed 60.But that might take a while, but let's try.First, write out all the terms:k=0: C(6,0)*(2x)^6*(-1/√x)^0 = 1*64x^6*1 = 64x^6.k=1: C(6,1)*(2x)^5*(-1/√x)^1 = 6*32x^5*(-1/√x) = 6*32*(-1)*x^(5 - 0.5) = -192x^4.5.k=2: C(6,2)*(2x)^4*(-1/√x)^2 = 15*16x^4*(1/x) = 15*16*x^(4 - 1) = 240x^3.k=3: C(6,3)*(2x)^3*(-1/√x)^3 = 20*8x^3*(-1/x^1.5) = 20*8*(-1)*x^(3 - 1.5) = -160x^1.5.k=4: C(6,4)*(2x)^2*(-1/√x)^4 = 15*4x^2*(1/x^2) = 15*4*x^(2 - 2) = 60x^0 = 60.k=5: C(6,5)*(2x)^1*(-1/√x)^5 = 6*2x*(-1/x^2.5) = 6*2*(-1)*x^(1 - 2.5) = -12x^(-1.5).k=6: C(6,6)*(2x)^0*(-1/√x)^6 = 1*1*(1/x^3) = x^(-3).So, compiling all the terms:64x^6 - 192x^4.5 + 240x^3 - 160x^1.5 + 60 - 12x^(-1.5) + x^(-3).So, the constant term is indeed 60. All other terms have exponents of x that are not zero, so 60 is the only constant term.Therefore, the answer is 60.But just to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients again. The sum is 64, which is 2^6, so n=6 is correct. So, all my steps are consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about the constant term is to consider the exponents.In the expansion, each term is of the form C(6, k)*(2x)^(6 - k)*(-1/√x)^k.So, the exponent of x is (6 - k) - (k)/2 = 6 - (3k)/2.We set this equal to zero:6 - (3k)/2 = 0 => k = 4.So, the constant term is when k=4, which is C(6,4)*(2)^2*(-1)^4 = 15*4*1 = 60.Yep, same result.So, I think that's solid. The constant term is 60.**Final Answer**The constant term is boxed{60}."},{"question":"[ sin^4 frac{pi}{8} + cos^4 frac{3pi}{8} + sin^4 frac{5pi}{8} + cos^4 frac{7pi}{8} ]","answer":"Alright, so I have this expression to evaluate: [ sin^4 frac{pi}{8} + cos^4 frac{3pi}{8} + sin^4 frac{5pi}{8} + cos^4 frac{7pi}{8} ]Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that powers of sine and cosine can sometimes be simplified using trigonometric identities. Maybe I can use the power-reduction formulas or something similar.First, let me recall the power-reduction identity for sine squared:[ sin^2 theta = frac{1 - cos 2theta}{2} ]Similarly, for cosine squared:[ cos^2 theta = frac{1 + cos 2theta}{2} ]But in this case, we have sine and cosine raised to the fourth power. I think I can express the fourth power in terms of the square power, and then apply the identities again.So, let me consider (sin^4 theta). That can be written as ((sin^2 theta)^2). Using the identity above:[ sin^4 theta = left( frac{1 - cos 2theta}{2} right)^2 ]Similarly, for (cos^4 theta):[ cos^4 theta = left( frac{1 + cos 2theta}{2} right)^2 ]Let me expand these squared terms.Starting with (sin^4 theta):[ sin^4 theta = left( frac{1 - cos 2theta}{2} right)^2 = frac{1 - 2cos 2theta + cos^2 2theta}{4} ]And for (cos^4 theta):[ cos^4 theta = left( frac{1 + cos 2theta}{2} right)^2 = frac{1 + 2cos 2theta + cos^2 2theta}{4} ]Now, I notice that both expressions have a (cos^2 2theta) term. Maybe I can apply the power-reduction identity again on that term.Recall that:[ cos^2 phi = frac{1 + cos 2phi}{2} ]So, substituting (phi = 2theta), we get:[ cos^2 2theta = frac{1 + cos 4theta}{2} ]Let me substitute this back into the expressions for (sin^4 theta) and (cos^4 theta).Starting with (sin^4 theta):[ sin^4 theta = frac{1 - 2cos 2theta + frac{1 + cos 4theta}{2}}{4} ]Let me simplify this step by step. First, combine the constants:1 can be written as 2/2, so:[ sin^4 theta = frac{frac{2}{2} - 2cos 2theta + frac{1}{2} + frac{cos 4theta}{2}}{4} ]Combine the constants:2/2 + 1/2 = 3/2So,[ sin^4 theta = frac{frac{3}{2} - 2cos 2theta + frac{cos 4theta}{2}}{4} ]Now, let's write all terms over 4:[ sin^4 theta = frac{3}{8} - frac{cos 2theta}{2} + frac{cos 4theta}{8} ]Similarly, let's do the same for (cos^4 theta):[ cos^4 theta = frac{1 + 2cos 2theta + frac{1 + cos 4theta}{2}}{4} ]Again, break it down:1 is 2/2, so:[ cos^4 theta = frac{frac{2}{2} + 2cos 2theta + frac{1}{2} + frac{cos 4theta}{2}}{4} ]Combine constants:2/2 + 1/2 = 3/2So,[ cos^4 theta = frac{frac{3}{2} + 2cos 2theta + frac{cos 4theta}{2}}{4} ]Write all terms over 4:[ cos^4 theta = frac{3}{8} + frac{cos 2theta}{2} + frac{cos 4theta}{8} ]Okay, so now I have expressions for both (sin^4 theta) and (cos^4 theta). Let me write them together:[ sin^4 theta = frac{3}{8} - frac{cos 2theta}{2} + frac{cos 4theta}{8} ][ cos^4 theta = frac{3}{8} + frac{cos 2theta}{2} + frac{cos 4theta}{8} ]Hmm, interesting. So, if I add (sin^4 theta + cos^4 theta), the (cos 2theta) terms will cancel out, right?Let me check:[ sin^4 theta + cos^4 theta = left( frac{3}{8} - frac{cos 2theta}{2} + frac{cos 4theta}{8} right) + left( frac{3}{8} + frac{cos 2theta}{2} + frac{cos 4theta}{8} right) ]Adding term by term:- The constants: 3/8 + 3/8 = 6/8 = 3/4- The (cos 2theta) terms: -cos2θ/2 + cos2θ/2 = 0- The (cos 4theta) terms: cos4θ/8 + cos4θ/8 = cos4θ/4So, overall:[ sin^4 theta + cos^4 theta = frac{3}{4} + frac{cos 4theta}{4} ]That's a nice simplification. So, in general, for any angle θ, the sum of sin^4 θ and cos^4 θ is 3/4 plus 1/4 cos4θ.But in our original problem, we have four terms: two sine^4 and two cosine^4, each with different angles. Let me write them down:1. (sin^4 frac{pi}{8})2. (cos^4 frac{3pi}{8})3. (sin^4 frac{5pi}{8})4. (cos^4 frac{7pi}{8})So, perhaps I can pair them up and apply the identity I just found.Looking at the angles:- (pi/8) and (5pi/8): Let me see, 5π/8 is equal to π - 3π/8, right? Because π is 8π/8, so 8π/8 - 3π/8 = 5π/8.Similarly, 7π/8 is equal to π - π/8, since 8π/8 - π/8 = 7π/8.So, maybe there's some symmetry here.I remember that sine and cosine have co-function identities:[ sin theta = cos left( frac{pi}{2} - theta right) ][ cos theta = sin left( frac{pi}{2} - theta right) ]But let me see if that helps here.Alternatively, I can note that sin(π - θ) = sinθ and cos(π - θ) = -cosθ.So, let's compute each term:1. (sin^4 frac{pi}{8}): That's straightforward.2. (cos^4 frac{3pi}{8}): Let me note that 3π/8 is equal to π/2 - π/8. So, using the co-function identity:[ cos frac{3pi}{8} = sin left( frac{pi}{2} - frac{3pi}{8} right) = sin frac{pi}{8} ]Therefore, (cos^4 frac{3pi}{8} = sin^4 frac{pi}{8}).Similarly, for the third term:3. (sin^4 frac{5pi}{8}): Since 5π/8 = π - 3π/8, and sin(π - θ) = sinθ, so:[ sin frac{5pi}{8} = sin left( pi - frac{3pi}{8} right) = sin frac{3pi}{8} ]Therefore, (sin^4 frac{5pi}{8} = sin^4 frac{3pi}{8}).Similarly, for the fourth term:4. (cos^4 frac{7pi}{8}): Since 7π/8 = π - π/8, and cos(π - θ) = -cosθ, so:[ cos frac{7pi}{8} = cos left( pi - frac{pi}{8} right) = -cos frac{pi}{8} ]But since it's raised to the fourth power, the negative sign will disappear:[ cos^4 frac{7pi}{8} = left( -cos frac{pi}{8} right)^4 = cos^4 frac{pi}{8} ]So, putting it all together, our original expression becomes:[ sin^4 frac{pi}{8} + sin^4 frac{pi}{8} + sin^4 frac{3pi}{8} + cos^4 frac{pi}{8} ]Wait, let me make sure:- First term: sin^4(π/8)- Second term: cos^4(3π/8) = sin^4(π/8)- Third term: sin^4(5π/8) = sin^4(3π/8)- Fourth term: cos^4(7π/8) = cos^4(π/8)So, the expression is:sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8) + cos^4(π/8)Which is:2 sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8) + cos^4(π/8)Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can pair terms differently.Alternatively, perhaps I can pair sin^4(π/8) with cos^4(π/8), and sin^4(3π/8) with cos^4(3π/8). But wait, in our expression, we have sin^4(π/8) and cos^4(π/8), but also sin^4(3π/8). Let me see.Wait, no, in the transformed expression, we have:2 sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8) + cos^4(π/8)So, perhaps I can group sin^4(π/8) + cos^4(π/8) together, and then have sin^4(3π/8) + sin^4(π/8). Hmm, but that might not be the most straightforward.Wait, maybe I can use the identity I derived earlier for sin^4 θ + cos^4 θ.Recall that:[ sin^4 theta + cos^4 theta = frac{3}{4} + frac{cos 4theta}{4} ]So, if I can pair terms in such a way, maybe I can apply this identity.Looking at our expression:2 sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8) + cos^4(π/8)I can write this as:[sin^4(π/8) + cos^4(π/8)] + sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8)So, the first pair is sin^4(π/8) + cos^4(π/8), which equals 3/4 + cos(4*(π/8))/4 = 3/4 + cos(π/2)/4.But cos(π/2) is 0, so that simplifies to 3/4.So, the first part is 3/4.Then, we have sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8). Hmm, okay, so now we have:3/4 + sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8)So, now I need to compute sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8). Let me see if I can find a relationship between these two terms.I know that 3π/8 is equal to π/2 - π/8, so:sin(3π/8) = sin(π/2 - π/8) = cos(π/8)Therefore, sin^4(3π/8) = cos^4(π/8)So, our expression becomes:3/4 + sin^4(π/8) + cos^4(π/8)But wait, sin^4(π/8) + cos^4(π/8) is again 3/4, as we saw earlier.Therefore, the entire expression is:3/4 + 3/4 = 3/2Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify step by step.Starting from the original expression:sin^4(π/8) + cos^4(3π/8) + sin^4(5π/8) + cos^4(7π/8)We transformed each term:- cos^4(3π/8) = sin^4(π/8)- sin^4(5π/8) = sin^4(3π/8)- cos^4(7π/8) = cos^4(π/8)So, substituting back, the expression becomes:sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8) + cos^4(π/8)Which is:2 sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8) + cos^4(π/8)Then, grouping sin^4(π/8) + cos^4(π/8) = 3/4So, the expression becomes:3/4 + sin^4(π/8) + sin^4(3π/8)But sin^4(3π/8) = cos^4(π/8), so:3/4 + sin^4(π/8) + cos^4(π/8) = 3/4 + 3/4 = 3/2Therefore, the total sum is 3/2.Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check using another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term numerically and add them up.Let me compute each term:1. sin^4(π/8):First, π/8 is 22.5 degrees. sin(22.5°) is sqrt(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.382683So, sin^4(π/8) ≈ (0.382683)^4 ≈ 0.0208Wait, that seems too small. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.Wait, sin(π/8) = sin(22.5°) = sqrt(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.382683So, sin^4(π/8) = (0.382683)^4 ≈ (0.382683)^2 * (0.382683)^2 ≈ (0.146447) * (0.146447) ≈ 0.021435Similarly, cos(3π/8) is cos(67.5°) = sqrt(2 - sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.382683So, cos^4(3π/8) ≈ (0.382683)^4 ≈ 0.021435Similarly, sin(5π/8) = sin(112.5°) = sin(67.5°) = sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))/2 ≈ 0.92388So, sin^4(5π/8) ≈ (0.92388)^4 ≈ (0.85355)^2 ≈ 0.7285Wait, let me compute it step by step:sin(5π/8) = sin(π - 3π/8) = sin(3π/8) ≈ 0.92388So, sin^4(5π/8) = (0.92388)^4 ≈ (0.92388)^2 * (0.92388)^2 ≈ (0.85355) * (0.85355) ≈ 0.7285Similarly, cos(7π/8) = cos(π - π/8) = -cos(π/8) ≈ -0.92388So, cos^4(7π/8) = (-0.92388)^4 = (0.92388)^4 ≈ 0.7285So, now, adding all four terms:sin^4(π/8) ≈ 0.021435cos^4(3π/8) ≈ 0.021435sin^4(5π/8) ≈ 0.7285cos^4(7π/8) ≈ 0.7285Adding them up:0.021435 + 0.021435 + 0.7285 + 0.7285 ≈0.021435 + 0.021435 = 0.042870.7285 + 0.7285 = 1.457Total ≈ 0.04287 + 1.457 ≈ 1.49987 ≈ 1.5Which is 3/2.

Let me compute that:( x - 0.2x - 16 = 0.8x - 16 ).Okay, so after the first day, there are ( 0.8x - 16 ) candies left.Moving on to the second day. Karlsson ate 0.3 of the remaining candies and 20 more candies. So, the amount he ate on the second day is ( 0.3 times (0.8x - 16) + 20 ). Let me compute that:First, calculate 0.3 of the remaining candies: ( 0.3 times 0.8x = 0.24x ) and ( 0.3 times (-16) = -4.8 ). So, that part is ( 0.24x - 4.8 ). Then, he ate 20 more candies, so adding that gives ( 0.24x - 4.8 + 20 = 0.24x + 15.2 ).Therefore, the amount eaten on the second day is ( 0.24x + 15.2 ). To find the remaining candies after the second day, subtract this from the remaining after day one:( (0.8x - 16) - (0.24x + 15.2) = 0.8x - 16 - 0.24x - 15.2 ).Simplify that:( (0.8x - 0.24x) + (-16 - 15.2) = 0.56x - 31.2 ).So, after the second day, there are ( 0.56x - 31.2 ) candies left.Now, on the third day, Karlsson ate 0.75 of the remaining candies and the last 30 candies. So, the amount he ate on the third day is ( 0.75 times (0.56x - 31.2) + 30 ). Let me compute that:First, calculate 0.75 of the remaining candies: ( 0.75 times 0.56x = 0.42x ) and ( 0.75 times (-31.2) = -23.4 ). So, that part is ( 0.42x - 23.4 ). Then, he ate 30 more candies, so adding that gives ( 0.42x - 23.4 + 30 = 0.42x + 6.6 ).Therefore, the amount eaten on the third day is ( 0.42x + 6.6 ). Since he ate all the remaining candies on the third day, the amount eaten on the third day should equal the remaining candies after the second day. So, we can set up the equation:( 0.42x + 6.6 = 0.56x - 31.2 ).Now, let's solve for ( x ). Let me bring all the terms involving ( x ) to one side and constants to the other side.Subtract ( 0.42x ) from both sides:( 6.6 = 0.14x - 31.2 ).Then, add 31.2 to both sides:( 6.6 + 31.2 = 0.14x ).Calculating the left side:( 37.8 = 0.14x ).Now, to find ( x ), divide both sides by 0.14:( x = 37.8 / 0.14 ).Let me compute that. 37.8 divided by 0.14. Hmm, 0.14 goes into 37.8 how many times? Let me think. 0.14 times 200 is 28, 0.14 times 270 is 37.8. Wait, 0.14 times 270 is 37.8, because 0.14 times 100 is 14, so 0.14 times 200 is 28, and 0.14 times 70 is 9.8, so 28 + 9.8 is 37.8. So, 0.14 times 270 is 37.8, which means x is 270.Wait, let me verify that because 0.14 times 270 is indeed 37.8. So, x is 270. So, the total number of candies in the box was 270.But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with x = 270.First day: 0.2 * 270 + 16 = 54 + 16 = 70 candies eaten. Remaining: 270 - 70 = 200.Second day: 0.3 * 200 + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80 candies eaten. Remaining: 200 - 80 = 120.Third day: 0.75 * 120 + 30 = 90 + 30 = 120 candies eaten. Remaining: 120 - 120 = 0.Yes, that adds up perfectly. So, Karlsson ate all the candies in three days, starting with 270 candies.Therefore, the total number of candies in the box was 270.**Final Answer**The box contained boxed{270} candies."},{"question":"If sqrt{m-2}+(n+3)^{2}=0, then the value of m+n is ______.","answer":"To solve the equation √(m - 2) + (n + 3)² = 0, I start by recognizing that both terms on the left side must be non-negative because square roots and squares are always non-negative.Since the sum of these two non-negative terms equals zero, each term must individually be zero. This means √(m - 2) = 0 and (n + 3)² = 0.Solving √(m - 2) = 0, I square both sides to get m - 2 = 0, which leads to m = 2.Next, solving (n + 3)² = 0, I take the square root of both sides to find n + 3 = 0, resulting in n = -3.Finally, adding the values of m and n, I get m + n = 2 + (-3) = -1."},{"question":"Define an operation \\"oplus\\": aoplus b=ab+a+b+1.

Assuming these probabilities are independent, what is the probability that it rains over the weekend (that is, on at least one of the days)? Express your answer as a percentage.","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that it rains over the weekend, meaning it rains on at least one of the days, either Saturday or Sunday or both. The weatherman has given me the probabilities for each day: 40% chance on Saturday and 50% chance on Sunday. They also mentioned that these probabilities are independent, which I think means that the rain on one day doesn't affect the rain on the other day. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of independent events, the probability that both events happen is the product of their individual probabilities. So, if I wanted to find the probability that it rains both days, I could multiply 40% and 50%. But wait, the question isn't asking for the probability that it rains both days; it's asking for the probability that it rains on at least one day. So, how do I calculate that? I think there's a principle in probability where instead of calculating the probability of the event happening, you can calculate the probability of the event not happening and then subtract that from 1. That might be easier in this case because calculating \\"at least one\\" directly could involve adding probabilities and then subtracting the overlap, which might get complicated.Let me recall the formula for the probability of at least one event occurring. If A and B are two events, then the probability that either A or B occurs is equal to the probability of A plus the probability of B minus the probability that both A and B occur. So, in formula terms, that's P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since the events are independent, P(A and B) is just P(A) multiplied by P(B). So, plugging in the numbers, P(A) is 40%, which is 0.4, and P(B) is 50%, which is 0.5. Therefore, P(A and B) would be 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2. So, using the formula, P(A or B) = 0.4 + 0.5 - 0.2. Let me do that calculation: 0.4 plus 0.5 is 0.9, and then subtracting 0.2 gives me 0.7. So, converting that back to a percentage, that's 70%. Wait, but I also thought about using the complement method earlier. Let me verify that approach as well to make sure I get the same answer. The complement of \\"it rains on at least one day\\" is \\"it does not rain at all over the weekend.\\" So, if I can find the probability that it doesn't rain on Saturday and it doesn't rain on Sunday, then subtracting that from 1 should give me the desired probability.The probability that it doesn't rain on Saturday is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, and the probability that it doesn't rain on Sunday is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. Since the events are independent, the probability that it doesn't rain both days is 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3. Therefore, the probability that it rains on at least one day is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7, which is 70%. Okay, both methods give me the same result, so that's reassuring. I think 70% is the correct probability that it rains over the weekend.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. First method:- P(A) = 0.4- P(B) = 0.5- P(A and B) = 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2- P(A or B) = 0.4 + 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.7Second method:- P(not A) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6- P(not B) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5- P(not A and not B) = 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3- P(A or B) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7Yep, both methods confirm that the probability is 0.7, or 70%. I think that's solid. I wonder if there's another way to think about this problem. Maybe using a probability tree? Let me visualize it. On Saturday, there's a 40% chance of rain and a 60% chance of no rain. On Sunday, regardless of Saturday's outcome, there's a 50% chance of rain and 50% chance of no rain because they're independent.So, the possible outcomes are:1. Rain on Saturday and rain on Sunday2. Rain on Saturday and no rain on Sunday3. No rain on Saturday and rain on Sunday4. No rain on Saturday and no rain on SundayCalculating the probabilities for each:1. 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.22. 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.23. 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.34. 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3Adding up the probabilities where it rains at least once: outcomes 1, 2, and 3. So, 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.7. That's the same as before. So, using a probability tree also gives me 70%. I think I'm confident now that 70% is the correct answer. Just to recap, the key steps were recognizing that the events are independent, understanding that \\"at least one\\" can be approached either by adding probabilities and subtracting the overlap or by using the complement rule, and verifying the result through multiple methods to ensure consistency. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me double-check the arithmetic just in case. First method:0.4 + 0.5 = 0.90.9 - 0.2 = 0.7Second method:1 - 0.3 = 0.7Third method (probability tree):0.2 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.7All correct. I guess another thing to consider is whether the events are indeed independent. The problem statement says they are, so that's given. If they weren't independent, we would need more information, like the conditional probabilities, to solve the problem. But since they are independent, we can proceed as we did.So, in conclusion, the probability that it rains over the weekend is 70%.**Final Answer**The probability that it rains over the weekend is boxed{70%}."},{"question":"Let ( x ) and ( y ) be positive numbers whose sum is equal to 2. Find the maximum value of the expression ( x^2 y^2 (x^2 + y^2) ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of the expression ( x^2 y^2 (x^2 + y^2) ) given that ( x ) and ( y ) are positive numbers and their sum is 2. Hmm, that sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember from my calculus class that Lagrange multipliers can be used for such problems, but maybe there's a simpler way since the constraint is just ( x + y = 2 ).Let me write down what I know:- ( x + y = 2 )- ( x, y > 0 )- Need to maximize ( f(x, y) = x^2 y^2 (x^2 + y^2) )Since ( x + y = 2 ), maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for ( y ):( y = 2 - x )So, I can substitute ( y ) into the function ( f(x, y) ) to make it a function of a single variable ( x ). Let's do that:( f(x) = x^2 (2 - x)^2 [x^2 + (2 - x)^2] )Okay, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it step by step.First, let's compute ( (2 - x)^2 ):( (2 - x)^2 = 4 - 4x + x^2 )So, ( x^2 (2 - x)^2 = x^2 (4 - 4x + x^2) = 4x^2 - 4x^3 + x^4 )Now, let's compute ( x^2 + (2 - x)^2 ):( x^2 + (2 - x)^2 = x^2 + 4 - 4x + x^2 = 2x^2 - 4x + 4 )So, the function ( f(x) ) becomes:( f(x) = (4x^2 - 4x^3 + x^4)(2x^2 - 4x + 4) )Hmm, that's still a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply it out:Let me denote ( A = 4x^2 - 4x^3 + x^4 ) and ( B = 2x^2 - 4x + 4 ), so ( f(x) = A cdot B ).Multiplying A and B:First, multiply ( 4x^2 ) with each term in B:( 4x^2 cdot 2x^2 = 8x^4 )( 4x^2 cdot (-4x) = -16x^3 )( 4x^2 cdot 4 = 16x^2 )Next, multiply ( -4x^3 ) with each term in B:( -4x^3 cdot 2x^2 = -8x^5 )( -4x^3 cdot (-4x) = 16x^4 )( -4x^3 cdot 4 = -16x^3 )Then, multiply ( x^4 ) with each term in B:( x^4 cdot 2x^2 = 2x^6 )( x^4 cdot (-4x) = -4x^5 )( x^4 cdot 4 = 4x^4 )Now, let's add all these terms together:- ( 8x^4 - 16x^3 + 16x^2 - 8x^5 + 16x^4 - 16x^3 + 2x^6 - 4x^5 + 4x^4 )Let me combine like terms:- ( 2x^6 ) (only one term)- ( (-8x^5 - 4x^5) = -12x^5 )- ( (8x^4 + 16x^4 + 4x^4) = 28x^4 )- ( (-16x^3 - 16x^3) = -32x^3 )- ( 16x^2 ) (only one term)So, putting it all together:( f(x) = 2x^6 - 12x^5 + 28x^4 - 32x^3 + 16x^2 )Wow, that's a sixth-degree polynomial. Taking the derivative of this might be a bit tedious, but let's try.First, let's write the derivative ( f'(x) ):( f'(x) = 12x^5 - 60x^4 + 112x^3 - 96x^2 + 32x )Hmm, that's still a fifth-degree polynomial. Solving ( f'(x) = 0 ) might be challenging. Maybe there's a smarter substitution or a way to factor this.Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution earlier on to simplify the expression. Let me think.Since ( x + y = 2 ), maybe I can let ( x = 1 + t ) and ( y = 1 - t ), where ( t ) is between -1 and 1. But since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive, ( t ) must be between -1 and 1, but actually, since both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive, ( t ) must be between -1 and 1, but more specifically, ( t ) must be between -1 and 1, but ( x = 1 + t > 0 ) and ( y = 1 - t > 0 ), so ( t ) must be between -1 and 1.Wait, but if ( x = 1 + t ) and ( y = 1 - t ), then ( x + y = 2 ), which is correct. Let's try substituting this into the original function.So, ( x = 1 + t ), ( y = 1 - t ), with ( -1 < t < 1 ).Compute ( x^2 y^2 (x^2 + y^2) ):First, compute ( x^2 ) and ( y^2 ):( x^2 = (1 + t)^2 = 1 + 2t + t^2 )( y^2 = (1 - t)^2 = 1 - 2t + t^2 )So, ( x^2 y^2 = (1 + 2t + t^2)(1 - 2t + t^2) )Let me compute that:Multiply ( (1 + 2t + t^2)(1 - 2t + t^2) ):First, multiply 1 with each term in the second polynomial:( 1 cdot 1 = 1 )( 1 cdot (-2t) = -2t )( 1 cdot t^2 = t^2 )Then, multiply 2t with each term:( 2t cdot 1 = 2t )( 2t cdot (-2t) = -4t^2 )( 2t cdot t^2 = 2t^3 )Then, multiply t^2 with each term:( t^2 cdot 1 = t^2 )( t^2 cdot (-2t) = -2t^3 )( t^2 cdot t^2 = t^4 )Now, add all these terms:1 - 2t + t^2 + 2t - 4t^2 + 2t^3 + t^2 - 2t^3 + t^4Combine like terms:- Constant term: 1- t terms: (-2t + 2t) = 0- t^2 terms: (t^2 - 4t^2 + t^2) = (-2t^2)- t^3 terms: (2t^3 - 2t^3) = 0- t^4 term: t^4So, ( x^2 y^2 = 1 - 2t^2 + t^4 )Now, compute ( x^2 + y^2 ):( x^2 + y^2 = (1 + 2t + t^2) + (1 - 2t + t^2) = 2 + 2t^2 )So, the function ( f(t) = x^2 y^2 (x^2 + y^2) = (1 - 2t^2 + t^4)(2 + 2t^2) )Let me compute this:Multiply ( (1 - 2t^2 + t^4) ) by ( 2 + 2t^2 ):First, multiply 1 by each term:1 * 2 = 21 * 2t^2 = 2t^2Then, multiply -2t^2 by each term:-2t^2 * 2 = -4t^2-2t^2 * 2t^2 = -4t^4Then, multiply t^4 by each term:t^4 * 2 = 2t^4t^4 * 2t^2 = 2t^6Now, add all these terms:2 + 2t^2 - 4t^2 - 4t^4 + 2t^4 + 2t^6Combine like terms:- Constant term: 2- t^2 terms: (2t^2 - 4t^2) = -2t^2- t^4 terms: (-4t^4 + 2t^4) = -2t^4- t^6 term: 2t^6So, ( f(t) = 2t^6 - 2t^4 - 2t^2 + 2 )Hmm, that seems a bit simpler. So, ( f(t) = 2t^6 - 2t^4 - 2t^2 + 2 )Now, to find the maximum, we can take the derivative of ( f(t) ) with respect to ( t ) and set it equal to zero.Compute ( f'(t) ):( f'(t) = 12t^5 - 8t^3 - 4t )Set ( f'(t) = 0 ):( 12t^5 - 8t^3 - 4t = 0 )Factor out 4t:( 4t(3t^4 - 2t^2 - 1) = 0 )So, either ( 4t = 0 ) or ( 3t^4 - 2t^2 - 1 = 0 )Case 1: ( 4t = 0 ) implies ( t = 0 )Case 2: ( 3t^4 - 2t^2 - 1 = 0 )Let me solve Case 2. Let me set ( u = t^2 ), so the equation becomes:( 3u^2 - 2u - 1 = 0 )This is a quadratic in ( u ). Let's solve for ( u ):Using quadratic formula:( u = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 12}}{6} = frac{2 pm sqrt{16}}{6} = frac{2 pm 4}{6} )So, two solutions:1. ( u = frac{2 + 4}{6} = frac{6}{6} = 1 )2. ( u = frac{2 - 4}{6} = frac{-2}{6} = -frac{1}{3} )Since ( u = t^2 ) must be non-negative, we discard the negative solution. So, ( u = 1 ), which implies ( t^2 = 1 ), so ( t = pm 1 )But earlier, we had ( t ) between -1 and 1, so ( t = 1 ) and ( t = -1 ) are the endpoints.So, the critical points are at ( t = 0 ), ( t = 1 ), and ( t = -1 )Now, let's evaluate ( f(t) ) at these critical points and also check the endpoints.Wait, actually, ( t = 1 ) and ( t = -1 ) are endpoints because when ( t = 1 ), ( y = 0 ), and when ( t = -1 ), ( x = 0 ). But the problem states that ( x ) and ( y ) are positive, so ( t ) must be strictly between -1 and 1. So, actually, ( t = 1 ) and ( t = -1 ) are not included in the domain. Therefore, the only critical point inside the domain is ( t = 0 ).But wait, let's double-check. If ( t = 1 ), then ( y = 0 ), which is not positive, so we exclude ( t = 1 ). Similarly, ( t = -1 ) gives ( x = 0 ), which is also excluded. So, the only critical point is ( t = 0 ).But let's also check the behavior near the endpoints. As ( t ) approaches 1 from the left, ( y ) approaches 0, and as ( t ) approaches -1 from the right, ( x ) approaches 0.However, since ( x ) and ( y ) must be positive, we can consider the interval ( -1 < t < 1 ), but not including the endpoints.So, our critical points are only at ( t = 0 ). Let's compute ( f(t) ) at ( t = 0 ):( f(0) = 2(0)^6 - 2(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 2 = 2 )Now, let's see if this is a maximum or a minimum. Since the function is symmetric around ( t = 0 ), maybe we can test values around ( t = 0 ).Let me pick ( t = 0.5 ):Compute ( f(0.5) = 2(0.5)^6 - 2(0.5)^4 - 2(0.5)^2 + 2 )Calculate each term:( 2(0.5)^6 = 2(1/64) = 1/32 ≈ 0.03125 )( -2(0.5)^4 = -2(1/16) = -1/8 = -0.125 )( -2(0.5)^2 = -2(1/4) = -0.5 )( +2 )So, adding them up:0.03125 - 0.125 - 0.5 + 2 ≈ 0.03125 - 0.625 + 2 ≈ 1.40625Which is less than 2.Now, let's try ( t = 0.25 ):( f(0.25) = 2(0.25)^6 - 2(0.25)^4 - 2(0.25)^2 + 2 )Compute each term:( 2(0.25)^6 = 2(1/4096) ≈ 0.000488 )( -2(0.25)^4 = -2(1/256) ≈ -0.0078125 )( -2(0.25)^2 = -2(1/16) = -0.125 )( +2 )Adding them up:≈ 0.000488 - 0.0078125 - 0.125 + 2 ≈ 1.8676755Still less than 2.Wait, but at ( t = 0 ), we have ( f(0) = 2 ). So, maybe ( t = 0 ) is a local maximum.But let's check another point, say ( t = sqrt{1/3} ) or something, but maybe it's better to analyze the second derivative.Compute the second derivative ( f''(t) ):We have ( f'(t) = 12t^5 - 8t^3 - 4t )So, ( f''(t) = 60t^4 - 24t^2 - 4 )Evaluate at ( t = 0 ):( f''(0) = 0 - 0 - 4 = -4 ), which is negative, so ( t = 0 ) is a local maximum.But wait, earlier when I plugged in ( t = 0.5 ), the function value was about 1.406, which is less than 2, and at ( t = 0.25 ), it was about 1.867, still less than 2. So, it seems that the maximum is indeed at ( t = 0 ), giving ( f(t) = 2 ).But wait, let's check another point, say ( t = sqrt{1/2} approx 0.707 ), but that's close to 1, so maybe the function is increasing towards 1, but since ( t = 1 ) is excluded, perhaps the maximum is indeed at ( t = 0 ).Wait, but let me think again. When ( t = 0 ), ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 1 ). So, the function ( f(x, y) = 1^2 * 1^2 * (1^2 + 1^2) = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2 ).But is this the maximum? Maybe not. Because when ( x ) and ( y ) are unequal, perhaps the function can be larger.Wait, let's try ( x = 2 ), but no, ( x + y = 2 ), so ( x ) can't be 2. Similarly, ( x ) can't be 0.Wait, but when ( t ) approaches 1, ( y ) approaches 0, so ( x ) approaches 2. Let's see what happens to ( f(t) ) as ( t ) approaches 1.Compute the limit as ( t ) approaches 1 from the left:( f(t) = 2t^6 - 2t^4 - 2t^2 + 2 )At ( t = 1 ), it would be ( 2 - 2 - 2 + 2 = 0 ). So, as ( t ) approaches 1, ( f(t) ) approaches 0.Similarly, as ( t ) approaches -1, ( f(t) ) approaches 0.So, the function starts at 0 when ( t = -1 ), increases to some maximum, then decreases back to 0 at ( t = 1 ). But according to our earlier calculation, the only critical point is at ( t = 0 ), which is a local maximum with ( f(t) = 2 ).But wait, when I tried ( t = 0.5 ), I got ( f(t) ≈ 1.406 ), which is less than 2, and at ( t = 0.25 ), I got about 1.867, which is still less than 2. So, it seems that ( t = 0 ) is indeed the maximum.But wait, let me check another point, say ( t = sqrt{1/3} approx 0.577 ):Compute ( f(t) ):First, ( t^2 = 1/3 ), ( t^4 = 1/9 ), ( t^6 = 1/27 )So,( f(t) = 2*(1/27) - 2*(1/9) - 2*(1/3) + 2 )Compute each term:( 2/27 ≈ 0.074 )( -2/9 ≈ -0.222 )( -2/3 ≈ -0.666 )( +2 )Adding them up:≈ 0.074 - 0.222 - 0.666 + 2 ≈ 1.186Still less than 2.Hmm, so it seems that the maximum is indeed at ( t = 0 ), giving ( f(t) = 2 ).But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution or the derivative.Wait, when I substituted ( x = 1 + t ) and ( y = 1 - t ), I got ( f(t) = 2t^6 - 2t^4 - 2t^2 + 2 ). Then, taking the derivative, I got ( f'(t) = 12t^5 - 8t^3 - 4t ), which factors to ( 4t(3t^4 - 2t^2 - 1) ). Setting this equal to zero, I got ( t = 0 ) and ( t = pm 1 ), but ( t = pm 1 ) are endpoints where the function is zero.So, the only critical point inside the interval is ( t = 0 ), which is a local maximum.Therefore, the maximum value of the function is 2, achieved when ( t = 0 ), which corresponds to ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 1 ).But wait, let me check the original function at ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 1 ):( f(1, 1) = 1^2 * 1^2 * (1^2 + 1^2) = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2 ). That's correct.But is there a possibility that the function could be larger elsewhere? Maybe I should try another approach.Alternatively, perhaps using AM-GM inequality or some other inequality.Let me consider the expression ( x^2 y^2 (x^2 + y^2) ).Since ( x + y = 2 ), maybe I can express ( x^2 + y^2 ) in terms of ( (x + y)^2 - 2xy ).Compute ( x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 4 - 2xy )So, the expression becomes ( x^2 y^2 (4 - 2xy) = x^2 y^2 (4 - 2xy) )Let me denote ( z = xy ). Then, the expression becomes ( z^2 (4 - 2z) = 4z^2 - 2z^3 )So, now, we need to maximize ( f(z) = 4z^2 - 2z^3 ) with respect to ( z ), given that ( x ) and ( y ) are positive and ( x + y = 2 ).But what is the range of ( z = xy )?Since ( x + y = 2 ), by AM-GM inequality, ( xy leq left( frac{x + y}{2} right)^2 = 1 ). So, ( z leq 1 ). Also, since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive, ( z > 0 ).So, ( 0 < z leq 1 )Now, we can treat ( f(z) = 4z^2 - 2z^3 ) as a function of ( z ) in the interval ( (0, 1] ).Take the derivative of ( f(z) ):( f'(z) = 8z - 6z^2 )Set ( f'(z) = 0 ):( 8z - 6z^2 = 0 )Factor out 2z:( 2z(4 - 3z) = 0 )So, ( z = 0 ) or ( z = 4/3 )But ( z = 4/3 ) is greater than 1, which is outside our interval ( (0, 1] ). So, the only critical point in the interval is at ( z = 0 ), but that's the minimum.Therefore, the maximum must occur at the endpoint ( z = 1 ).So, ( f(z) ) at ( z = 1 ) is ( 4(1)^2 - 2(1)^3 = 4 - 2 = 2 )Therefore, the maximum value is 2, achieved when ( z = 1 ), which occurs when ( x = y = 1 ).So, both approaches lead to the same conclusion: the maximum value is 2, achieved when ( x = y = 1 ).But wait, earlier when I tried substituting ( t = 0 ), I got the same result. So, it seems consistent.Therefore, the maximum value of the expression is 2.**Final Answer**The maximum value is boxed{2}."},{"question":"In this addition problem, each letter stands for a different digit.setlength{tabcolsep}{0.5mm}begin{array}{cccc}&T & W & O +&T & W & O hline F& O & U & Rend{array}If T = 7 and the letter O represents an even number, what is the only possible value for W?textbf{(A)} 0qquadtextbf{(B)} 1qquadtextbf{(C)} 2qquadtextbf{(D)} 3qquadtextbf{(E)} 4","answer":"First, I substitute the known value of ( T = 7 ) into the addition problem:[begin{array}{cccc} & 7 & W & O + & 7 & W & O hlineF & O & U & R end{array}]Next, I analyze the units place.

It looks like three equations with three variables: x, y, and z. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:1. ( x + 2y + 3z = 3 )2. ( 3x + y + 2z = 7 )3. ( 2x + 3y + z = 2 )Hmm, I need to find the values of x, y, and z that satisfy all three equations simultaneously. I remember there are a few methods to solve such systems: substitution, elimination, or maybe even using matrices. Since I'm more comfortable with elimination, I think I'll try that method first.Let me see. The goal is to eliminate variables step by step to reduce the system to a single equation in one variable. Then, I can work backward to find the other variables. Let's start by trying to eliminate one variable from two of the equations.Looking at the coefficients, maybe I can eliminate x first. Let me check the coefficients of x in each equation:1. The first equation has a coefficient of 1 for x.2. The second equation has a coefficient of 3 for x.3. The third equation has a coefficient of 2 for x.If I can make the coefficients of x the same in two equations, I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate x. Let's try eliminating x between the first and second equations.To do that, I can multiply the first equation by 3 so that the coefficient of x becomes 3, matching the second equation. Let's do that:Multiply equation 1 by 3:( 3x + 6y + 9z = 9 )  (Let's call this equation 4)Now, subtract equation 2 from equation 4 to eliminate x:Equation 4: ( 3x + 6y + 9z = 9 )Equation 2: ( 3x + y + 2z = 7 )Subtract equation 2 from equation 4:( (3x - 3x) + (6y - y) + (9z - 2z) = 9 - 7 )Simplify:( 0x + 5y + 7z = 2 )So, equation 5: ( 5y + 7z = 2 )Alright, that's one equation without x. Now, let's try to eliminate x from another pair of equations. Maybe between equation 1 and equation 3.Equation 1: ( x + 2y + 3z = 3 )Equation 3: ( 2x + 3y + z = 2 )If I multiply equation 1 by 2, the coefficient of x will be 2, matching equation 3.Multiply equation 1 by 2:( 2x + 4y + 6z = 6 )  (Let's call this equation 6)Now, subtract equation 3 from equation 6 to eliminate x:Equation 6: ( 2x + 4y + 6z = 6 )Equation 3: ( 2x + 3y + z = 2 )Subtract equation 3 from equation 6:( (2x - 2x) + (4y - 3y) + (6z - z) = 6 - 2 )Simplify:( 0x + y + 5z = 4 )So, equation 7: ( y + 5z = 4 )Great, now I have two equations without x:Equation 5: ( 5y + 7z = 2 )Equation 7: ( y + 5z = 4 )Now, I can try to eliminate y from these two equations. Let me see. Equation 7 has a coefficient of 1 for y, so maybe I can multiply equation 7 by 5 to make the coefficient of y equal to 5, matching equation 5.Multiply equation 7 by 5:( 5y + 25z = 20 )  (Let's call this equation 8)Now, subtract equation 5 from equation 8 to eliminate y:Equation 8: ( 5y + 25z = 20 )Equation 5: ( 5y + 7z = 2 )Subtract equation 5 from equation 8:( (5y - 5y) + (25z - 7z) = 20 - 2 )Simplify:( 0y + 18z = 18 )So, equation 9: ( 18z = 18 )That's straightforward. Solving for z:Divide both sides by 18:( z = 1 )Okay, so z is 1. Now, I can substitute z = 1 back into equation 7 to find y.Equation 7: ( y + 5z = 4 )Substitute z = 1:( y + 5(1) = 4 )Simplify:( y + 5 = 4 )Subtract 5 from both sides:( y = 4 - 5 )( y = -1 )Alright, so y is -1. Now, I can substitute y = -1 and z = 1 into one of the original equations to find x. Let's pick equation 1 because it looks simpler.Equation 1: ( x + 2y + 3z = 3 )Substitute y = -1 and z = 1:( x + 2(-1) + 3(1) = 3 )Simplify:( x - 2 + 3 = 3 )Combine like terms:( x + 1 = 3 )Subtract 1 from both sides:( x = 2 )So, x is 2. Let me just double-check these values in all three original equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First equation:( x + 2y + 3z = 3 )Plugging in x=2, y=-1, z=1:( 2 + 2(-1) + 3(1) = 2 - 2 + 3 = 3 )Which equals 3. Good.Second equation:( 3x + y + 2z = 7 )Plugging in x=2, y=-1, z=1:( 3(2) + (-1) + 2(1) = 6 - 1 + 2 = 7 )Which equals 7. Good.Third equation:( 2x + 3y + z = 2 )Plugging in x=2, y=-1, z=1:( 2(2) + 3(-1) + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2 )Which equals 2. Perfect.So, all three equations are satisfied with x=2, y=-1, z=1. That seems to be the solution.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my elimination steps, let me recap:1. I eliminated x from equations 1 and 2 to get equation 5: 5y + 7z = 2.2. Then, I eliminated x from equations 1 and 3 to get equation 7: y + 5z = 4.3. Then, I eliminated y from equations 5 and 7 by multiplying equation 7 by 5 to get equation 8: 5y + 25z = 20.4. Subtracting equation 5 from equation 8 gave me 18z = 18, so z=1.5. Substituted z=1 into equation 7 to get y=-1.6. Then, substituted y and z into equation 1 to get x=2.Everything seems to check out. I don't see any calculation errors in my steps. So, I think the solution is correct.Alternatively, just to be thorough, I could try using substitution or another method to see if I get the same result. Let me try substitution quickly.From equation 7: y + 5z = 4, so y = 4 - 5z.Substitute y = 4 - 5z into equation 5: 5y + 7z = 2.So, 5(4 - 5z) + 7z = 220 - 25z + 7z = 220 - 18z = 2Subtract 20 from both sides:-18z = -18Divide by -18:z = 1Same result. Then, y = 4 - 5(1) = -1. Then, substitute into equation 1: x + 2(-1) + 3(1) = 3 => x - 2 + 3 = 3 => x +1 =3 => x=2. Same result.So, substitution also gives the same answer. That gives me more confidence that x=2, y=-1, z=1 is correct.Alternatively, I could use matrices or determinants, like Cramer's rule, but since I already have the solution and it checks out, I think that's sufficient.Just to recap, the steps were:1. Eliminate x from equations 1 and 2 to get an equation in y and z.2. Eliminate x from equations 1 and 3 to get another equation in y and z.3. Then, eliminate y from those two new equations to solve for z.4. Back-substitute z into one of the equations to find y.5. Finally, substitute y and z into one of the original equations to find x.This systematic approach worked well. I didn't make any calculation mistakes that I can see, and the solution satisfies all three original equations, so I think I'm good.**Final Answer**The solution to the system is (boxed{x = 2}), (boxed{y = -1}), and (boxed{z = 1}).Alternatively, using the required format:The solution is (boxed{x = 2}), (boxed{y = -1}), and (boxed{z = 1}).But since the instructions say to put the final answer within boxed{}, and it's a system, maybe I should present all three variables in a single box. Let me check the instructions again.They say: \\"put your final answer within boxed{}\\"Hmm, maybe I should write all three variables in one box, like boxed{(2, -1, 1)}.Yes, that seems appropriate.**Final Answer**The solution to the system is (boxed{(2, -1, 1)})."},{"question":"In a geometric sequence {a_n} where all terms are positive, if log_{2}a_{2} + log_{2}a_{8} = 1, then a_{3} cdot a_{7} = ?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\\"In a geometric sequence {a_n} where all terms are positive, if log₂a₂ + log₂a₈ = 1, then a₃ · a₇ = ?\\"Hmm, okay. So, it's a geometric sequence, meaning each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. All terms are positive, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. First, let me recall some properties of geometric sequences. In a geometric sequence, each term is equal to the previous term multiplied by a common ratio, r. So, the nth term can be expressed as:a_n = a₁ * r^(n-1)Where a₁ is the first term and r is the common ratio.So, for this problem, a₂ would be a₁ * r^(2-1) = a₁ * r, and a₈ would be a₁ * r^(8-1) = a₁ * r^7.Similarly, a₃ is a₁ * r² and a₇ is a₁ * r⁶.The problem gives me an equation involving logarithms: log₂a₂ + log₂a₈ = 1.I remember that logarithms have some properties, especially that log_b(x) + log_b(y) = log_b(xy). So, maybe I can combine these two logarithms into one.Let me try that:log₂a₂ + log₂a₈ = log₂(a₂ * a₈) = 1So, log₂(a₂ * a₈) = 1Which means that a₂ * a₈ = 2^1 = 2.Okay, so a₂ * a₈ = 2.But I need to find a₃ * a₇.Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can express a₃ and a₇ in terms of a₁ and r, and then multiply them.So, a₃ = a₁ * r² and a₇ = a₁ * r⁶.Multiplying them together: a₃ * a₇ = (a₁ * r²) * (a₁ * r⁶) = a₁² * r^(2+6) = a₁² * r^8.Similarly, a₂ * a₈ = (a₁ * r) * (a₁ * r^7) = a₁² * r^(1+7) = a₁² * r^8.Wait a minute, that's interesting. So, a₂ * a₈ = a₁² * r^8, which is equal to 2, as we found earlier.But a₃ * a₇ is also equal to a₁² * r^8. So, that means a₃ * a₇ = a₂ * a₈ = 2.So, does that mean a₃ * a₇ is 2?Wait, let me verify that.Given that in a geometric sequence, the product of terms equidistant from the ends is constant. So, for example, a₁ * a_n = a₂ * a_{n-1} = ... and so on.But in this case, a₂ and a₈ are not necessarily equidistant from the ends unless the sequence is finite. But since it's a general geometric sequence, it could be infinite. However, the property still holds for any two terms that are symmetric around the middle term, but in an infinite sequence, there isn't a middle term.But in this case, a₂ and a₈ are 6 terms apart, right? From term 2 to term 8 is 6 terms. Similarly, a₃ and a₇ are 4 terms apart. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.But looking back, when I calculated a₂ * a₈ and a₃ * a₇, both expressions simplified to a₁² * r^8. So, regardless of the specific positions, their products are equal because they both result in the same exponent on r.Therefore, since a₂ * a₈ = 2, then a₃ * a₇ must also equal 2.So, the answer is 2.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again.1. The problem gives a geometric sequence with all positive terms.2. It provides log₂a₂ + log₂a₈ = 1.3. Using logarithm properties, log₂(a₂ * a₈) = 1, so a₂ * a₈ = 2^1 = 2.4. Express a₂ and a₈ in terms of a₁ and r: a₂ = a₁r, a₈ = a₁r^7.5. Multiply them: a₂ * a₈ = a₁²r^8 = 2.6. Express a₃ and a₇: a₃ = a₁r², a₇ = a₁r^6.7. Multiply them: a₃ * a₇ = a₁²r^8.8. Since a₁²r^8 is equal to 2 from step 5, a₃ * a₇ = 2.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 2.**Final Answer**boxed{2}"},{"question":"It is known that the arithmetic mean of the first 9 terms of an arithmetic sequence is 10, and the arithmetic mean of the first 10 terms is 13. Find the common difference of this arithmetic sequence.","answer":"First, I recognize that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference, denoted as ( d ).The arithmetic mean of the first 9 terms is 10. Since the mean is the sum divided by the number of terms, the sum of the first 9 terms is ( 9 times 10 = 90 ).Similarly, the arithmetic mean of the first 10 terms is 13, so the sum of the first 10 terms is ( 10 times 13 = 130 ).The difference between the sum of the first 10 terms and the sum of the first 9 terms gives the 10th term, which is ( 130 - 90 = 40 ).In an arithmetic sequence, the ( n )-th term is given by ( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d ). Therefore, the 10th term is ( a_1 + 9d = 40 ).The sum of the first 9 terms can also be expressed as ( frac{9}{2} times (2a_1 + 8d) = 90 ). Simplifying this equation gives ( 2a_1 + 8d = 20 ).Now, I have two equations:1. ( a_1 + 9d = 40 )2. ( 2a_1 + 8d = 20 )I can solve these equations simultaneously. By multiplying the first equation by 2, I get ( 2a_1 + 18d = 80 ). Subtracting the second equation from this result gives ( 10d = 60 ), so ( d = 6 ).Thus, the common difference of the arithmetic sequence is 6."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=log _{3}(9x) cdot log _{3}(3x), where frac {1}{9}leqslant xleqslant 9.(I) If m=log _{3}x, find the range of m;(II) Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x), and provide the corresponding x values.","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) = log₃(9x) multiplied by log₃(3x), and the domain is 1/9 ≤ x ≤ 9. The problem has two parts: first, to find the range of m where m = log₃x, and second, to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) along with the corresponding x values.Starting with part (I). Since m is defined as log base 3 of x, I need to find the range of m given the domain of x. The domain of x is from 1/9 to 9. So, I should compute log₃(1/9) and log₃(9) to find the minimum and maximum values of m.I remember that log₃(9) is 2 because 3 squared is 9. Similarly, log₃(1/9) is log₃(3^(-2)) which is -2. So, m ranges from -2 to 2. That seems straightforward.Wait, let me double-check. If x is 1/9, then log₃(1/9) is log₃(3^(-2)) which is indeed -2. And when x is 9, log₃(9) is log₃(3^2) which is 2. So, yes, m is between -2 and 2. So, part (I) is solved, m ∈ [-2, 2].Moving on to part (II). I need to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x). The function f(x) is log₃(9x) multiplied by log₃(3x). Maybe I can express this function in terms of m, since m = log₃x, which might simplify things.Let me rewrite f(x) using m. So, log₃(9x) can be written as log₃(9) + log₃x, which is log₃(9) + m. Similarly, log₃(3x) is log₃(3) + log₃x, which is log₃(3) + m.Calculating log₃(9) and log₃(3): log₃(9) is 2, as before, and log₃(3) is 1. So, substituting these in, f(x) becomes (2 + m) multiplied by (1 + m). So, f(x) = (2 + m)(1 + m).Let me expand this expression: (2 + m)(1 + m) = 2*1 + 2*m + m*1 + m*m = 2 + 2m + m + m² = 2 + 3m + m². So, f(x) can be rewritten as m² + 3m + 2.So now, instead of dealing with f(x), I can consider f(m) = m² + 3m + 2, where m is in the interval [-2, 2]. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum and minimum of this quadratic function on the interval [-2, 2].Quadratic functions have their extrema either at the vertex or at the endpoints of the interval. So, first, I should find the vertex of this parabola. The general form of a quadratic is f(m) = am² + bm + c, so here a = 1, b = 3, c = 2.The vertex occurs at m = -b/(2a) = -3/(2*1) = -1.5. So, the vertex is at m = -1.5. Since a = 1 is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning the vertex is a minimum point.Therefore, the minimum value of f(m) occurs at m = -1.5, and the maximum values will occur at the endpoints of the interval, which are m = -2 and m = 2.So, let's compute f(-2), f(-1.5), and f(2).First, f(-2) = (-2)² + 3*(-2) + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0.Next, f(-1.5) = (-1.5)² + 3*(-1.5) + 2 = 2.25 - 4.5 + 2 = (2.25 + 2) - 4.5 = 4.25 - 4.5 = -0.25.Then, f(2) = (2)² + 3*(2) + 2 = 4 + 6 + 2 = 12.So, f(m) has a minimum value of -0.25 at m = -1.5 and maximum values at the endpoints: 0 at m = -2 and 12 at m = 2.Wait, but hold on. The function f(m) is a quadratic, so it's continuous and differentiable everywhere, so on the closed interval [-2, 2], the extrema must occur either at critical points or endpoints. Since we only have one critical point at m = -1.5, which is a minimum, and the maximums are at the endpoints.But let me make sure that I didn't make a calculation error. Let me recalculate f(-2):f(-2) = (-2)^2 + 3*(-2) + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0. That's correct.f(-1.5) = (-1.5)^2 + 3*(-1.5) + 2 = 2.25 - 4.5 + 2 = (2.25 + 2) - 4.5 = 4.25 - 4.5 = -0.25. That's correct.f(2) = 4 + 6 + 2 = 12. Correct.So, the minimum value is -0.25 at m = -1.5, and the maximum is 12 at m = 2. But wait, at m = -2, f(m) is 0, which is higher than the minimum but lower than the maximum. So, the maximum is indeed 12, and the minimum is -0.25.But now, I need to relate this back to x. Since m = log₃x, and we found the critical points in terms of m, I need to find the corresponding x values.First, for the minimum value at m = -1.5:m = log₃x = -1.5 => x = 3^(-1.5). Let me compute that. 3^(-1.5) is 1/(3^(1.5)) = 1/(sqrt(3^3)) = 1/(sqrt(27)) = 1/(3*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/9 after rationalizing. Wait, let's see:3^(1.5) is 3^(3/2) which is sqrt(3^3) = sqrt(27) = 3*sqrt(3). So, 3^(-1.5) is 1/(3*sqrt(3)) which can be rationalized as sqrt(3)/9. Because multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):1/(3*sqrt(3)) * (sqrt(3)/sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/(3*3) = sqrt(3)/9.So, x = sqrt(3)/9 when m = -1.5.For the maximum at m = 2:m = log₃x = 2 => x = 3^2 = 9.And at m = -2:m = log₃x = -2 => x = 3^(-2) = 1/9.So, the function f(x) attains its minimum value of -0.25 at x = sqrt(3)/9 and its maximum value of 12 at x = 9. But wait, at x = 1/9, f(x) is 0, which is higher than the minimum but lower than the maximum.But hold on, f(x) is defined as log₃(9x) * log₃(3x). Let me verify if f(1/9) is indeed 0.Compute f(1/9):log₃(9*(1/9)) * log₃(3*(1/9)) = log₃(1) * log₃(1/3) = 0 * (-1) = 0. Correct.Similarly, f(9):log₃(9*9) * log₃(3*9) = log₃(81) * log₃(27) = 4 * 3 = 12. Correct.And f(sqrt(3)/9):First, compute log₃(9x) where x = sqrt(3)/9:9x = 9*(sqrt(3)/9) = sqrt(3). So, log₃(sqrt(3)) = log₃(3^(1/2)) = 1/2.Similarly, log₃(3x) where x = sqrt(3)/9:3x = 3*(sqrt(3)/9) = sqrt(3)/3 = 3^(-1/2). So, log₃(3^(-1/2)) = -1/2.Therefore, f(x) = (1/2)*(-1/2) = -1/4 = -0.25. Correct.So, everything checks out.But just to make sure, let me consider if there are any other critical points or if I missed something. The function f(m) is quadratic, so it only has one critical point, which is the vertex at m = -1.5. Since the parabola opens upwards, that's the only minimum, and the maximums are at the endpoints.Therefore, the conclusion is that the minimum value of f(x) is -0.25 at x = sqrt(3)/9, and the maximum value is 12 at x = 9. At x = 1/9, f(x) is 0, which is higher than the minimum but not the maximum.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check another point in the interval to see the behavior. For example, take x = 1, which is within [1/9, 9].Compute f(1):log₃(9*1) * log₃(3*1) = log₃(9) * log₃(3) = 2 * 1 = 2.So, f(1) = 2. Which is between 0 and 12, so it's consistent.Another point, say x = 3:f(3) = log₃(27) * log₃(9) = 3 * 2 = 6.So, f(3) = 6, which is less than 12 but more than 0.And x = 1/3:f(1/3) = log₃(3) * log₃(1) = 1 * 0 = 0.Wait, that's interesting. So, at x = 1/3, f(x) is 0. Similarly, at x = 1/9, f(x) is 0, and at x = 1, it's 2, at x = 3, it's 6, and at x = 9, it's 12.So, the function starts at 0 when x = 1/9, goes up to 2 at x = 1, then up to 6 at x = 3, and peaks at 12 at x = 9. But wait, earlier we found a minimum at x = sqrt(3)/9, which is approximately 0.192, which is between 1/9 (~0.111) and 1. So, the function actually dips below zero between x = 1/9 and x = 1, reaching a minimum of -0.25 at x = sqrt(3)/9, then increases again.So, this makes sense because when we converted f(x) into f(m), we saw that it's a quadratic opening upwards, so it will have a minimum in the middle and rise on both sides. But in terms of x, since m = log₃x is a monotonic function, increasing x corresponds to increasing m.Therefore, the function f(x) decreases from x = 1/9 to x = sqrt(3)/9, reaching a minimum, then increases from x = sqrt(3)/9 to x = 9.So, all in all, the maximum is at x = 9, which is 12, and the minimum is at x = sqrt(3)/9, which is -0.25.Just to recap:(I) m = log₃x, with x ∈ [1/9, 9], so m ∈ [-2, 2].(II) f(x) can be rewritten as f(m) = m² + 3m + 2, which is a quadratic with vertex at m = -1.5, which is within the interval [-2, 2]. The minimum value is f(-1.5) = -0.25, and the maximum values are at the endpoints: f(-2) = 0 and f(2) = 12. So, the maximum is 12, and the minimum is -0.25.Therefore, the corresponding x values are:For m = -1.5: x = 3^(-1.5) = sqrt(3)/9.For m = 2: x = 3^2 = 9.For m = -2: x = 3^(-2) = 1/9.But since f(1/9) = 0, which is not the maximum or minimum, just another point.So, summarizing:(I) The range of m is [-2, 2].(II) The maximum value of f(x) is 12 at x = 9, and the minimum value is -0.25 at x = sqrt(3)/9.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the calculations check out.**Final Answer**(I) The range of ( m ) is boxed{[-2, 2]}.(II) The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is boxed{12} at ( x = boxed{9} ), and the minimum value is boxed{-frac{1}{4}} at ( x = boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{9}} )."},{"question":"In right triangle ( triangle ACB ), (angle C = 90^{circ}), points (D) and (E) lie on (BC) and (CA) respectively, and (frac{BD}{AC} = frac{AE}{CD} = K). Let (BE) intersect (AD) at (O). If (angle BOD = 75^{circ}), what is (K)?","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here about a right triangle, and I need to find the value of K. Let me try to visualize it first.We have triangle ACB with a right angle at C. So, point C is the right angle, and sides AC and BC are the legs, with AB being the hypotenuse. Points D and E are on BC and AC respectively. The problem states that BD/AC = K and AE/CD = K. So, both these ratios are equal to K, which is the value we need to find.BE intersects AD at point O, and the angle BOD is 75 degrees. So, angle at O between BO and OD is 75 degrees. Hmm, okay.Let me try to sketch this mentally. Triangle ACB, right-angled at C. Let me denote the coordinates to make it easier. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, since it's a right triangle at C, I can let point A be at (0, b) and point B at (a, 0), where a and b are positive real numbers. So, AC is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0, b), and BC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (a, 0). Then, AB is the hypotenuse connecting (0, b) to (a, 0).Now, point D is on BC. Let me denote point D as (d, 0), where d is between 0 and a. Similarly, point E is on AC, so let me denote point E as (0, e), where e is between 0 and b.Given that BD/AC = K. BD is the length from B to D. Since B is at (a, 0) and D is at (d, 0), BD is |a - d|. AC is the length from A to C, which is b. So, BD/AC = (a - d)/b = K. Therefore, (a - d)/b = K, which implies that d = a - Kb.Similarly, AE/CD = K. AE is the length from A to E. A is at (0, b) and E is at (0, e), so AE is |b - e|. CD is the length from C to D, which is d. So, AE/CD = (b - e)/d = K. Therefore, (b - e)/d = K, which implies that e = b - Kd.But from earlier, we have d = a - Kb. So, substituting that into the expression for e, we get e = b - K(a - Kb) = b - Ka + K²b.So, e = b(1 + K²) - Ka.Alright, so now we have coordinates for points D and E in terms of a, b, and K.Point D is (d, 0) = (a - Kb, 0).Point E is (0, e) = (0, b(1 + K²) - Ka).Now, BE is the line connecting points B(a, 0) and E(0, e). Similarly, AD is the line connecting points A(0, b) and D(d, 0). These two lines intersect at point O.We need to find the coordinates of point O, which is the intersection of BE and AD. Then, we can analyze the angle BOD, which is given as 75 degrees, to find K.So, let's find the equations of lines BE and AD.First, equation of BE: passing through points B(a, 0) and E(0, e). The slope of BE is (e - 0)/(0 - a) = -e/a. So, the equation is y = (-e/a)(x - a). Simplifying, y = (-e/a)x + e.Similarly, equation of AD: passing through points A(0, b) and D(d, 0). The slope is (0 - b)/(d - 0) = -b/d. So, the equation is y = (-b/d)x + b.Now, to find point O, we need to solve these two equations:1. y = (-e/a)x + e2. y = (-b/d)x + bSet them equal:(-e/a)x + e = (-b/d)x + bLet me rearrange:[(-e/a) + (b/d)]x = b - eSo,x = (b - e) / [(-e/a) + (b/d)]Hmm, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.Numerator: b - eDenominator: (-e/a) + (b/d) = (b/d - e/a)So,x = (b - e) / (b/d - e/a)Let me write this as:x = (b - e) / ( (b a - e d) / (a d) ) ) = (b - e) * (a d) / (b a - e d)So,x = [a d (b - e)] / (a b - e d)Similarly, once we have x, we can find y by plugging back into one of the equations, say y = (-e/a)x + e.But before I proceed, let me substitute the expressions for d and e in terms of a, b, and K.Recall that d = a - K bAnd e = b(1 + K²) - K aSo, let's compute numerator and denominator step by step.First, compute numerator: b - e = b - [b(1 + K²) - K a] = b - b - b K² + K a = K a - b K² = K(a - b K)Denominator: a b - e dCompute e d:e d = [b(1 + K²) - K a] * (a - K b)Let me expand this:= b(1 + K²)(a - K b) - K a (a - K b)= [b a (1 + K²) - b K b (1 + K²)] - [K a² - K² a b]= b a (1 + K²) - b² K (1 + K²) - K a² + K² a bNow, let's collect like terms:Terms with a²: - K a²Terms with a b: b a (1 + K²) + K² a b = a b [1 + K² + K²] = a b (1 + 2 K²)Terms with b²: - b² K (1 + K²)So, e d = - K a² + a b (1 + 2 K²) - b² K (1 + K²)Therefore, denominator: a b - e d = a b - [ - K a² + a b (1 + 2 K²) - b² K (1 + K²) ]= a b + K a² - a b (1 + 2 K²) + b² K (1 + K²)Simplify term by term:a b - a b (1 + 2 K²) = a b [1 - (1 + 2 K²)] = a b (-2 K²)Then, + K a² + b² K (1 + K²)So, denominator = K a² - 2 K² a b + K b² (1 + K²)Factor out K:= K [a² - 2 K a b + b² (1 + K²)]Let me write this as:= K [a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b²]So, denominator = K [a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b²]Similarly, numerator was K(a - b K)So, putting it all together:x = [a d (b - e)] / (a b - e d) = [a d * K(a - b K)] / [K (a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b²)]Notice that K cancels out:x = [a d (a - b K)] / (a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b²)Now, let's substitute d = a - K b:x = [a (a - K b) (a - b K)] / (a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b²)Wait, numerator is a (a - K b)^2, since (a - K b)(a - K b) is (a - K b)^2.So, numerator = a (a - K b)^2Denominator: Let's see, a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b² = (a² - 2 K a b + K² b²) + b² = (a - K b)^2 + b²So, denominator = (a - K b)^2 + b²Therefore, x = [a (a - K b)^2] / [(a - K b)^2 + b²]Similarly, let me compute y.From equation y = (-e/a)x + e.We have e = b(1 + K²) - K a.So, y = [ - (b(1 + K²) - K a)/a ] x + (b(1 + K²) - K a )Simplify the slope:= [ (-b(1 + K²) + K a)/a ] x + (b(1 + K²) - K a )= [ (-b(1 + K²)/a + K ) ] x + (b(1 + K²) - K a )Let me write this as:y = [ K - (b(1 + K²)/a ) ] x + (b(1 + K²) - K a )Now, substitute x from above:x = [a (a - K b)^2] / [(a - K b)^2 + b²]So, let me compute each term.First, compute [ K - (b(1 + K²)/a ) ] x:= [ K - (b(1 + K²)/a ) ] * [a (a - K b)^2 / ( (a - K b)^2 + b² ) ]= [ (K a - b(1 + K²)) / a ] * [ a (a - K b)^2 / ( (a - K b)^2 + b² ) ]The a cancels:= (K a - b(1 + K²)) * (a - K b)^2 / ( (a - K b)^2 + b² )Then, the other term is (b(1 + K²) - K a )So, y = [ (K a - b(1 + K²)) * (a - K b)^2 / ( (a - K b)^2 + b² ) ] + (b(1 + K²) - K a )Let me factor out (b(1 + K²) - K a ) which is equal to - (K a - b(1 + K²)).So, y = - (K a - b(1 + K²)) * [ (a - K b)^2 / ( (a - K b)^2 + b² ) - 1 ]Wait, let me see:Let me write y as:y = [ (K a - b(1 + K²)) * (a - K b)^2 / D ] + (b(1 + K²) - K a )Where D = (a - K b)^2 + b²Let me factor out (K a - b(1 + K²)):= (K a - b(1 + K²)) * [ (a - K b)^2 / D - 1 ]But (K a - b(1 + K²)) is negative of (b(1 + K²) - K a )Wait, maybe another approach.Let me combine the two terms:y = [ (K a - b(1 + K²)) * (a - K b)^2 + (b(1 + K²) - K a ) * D ] / DWhere D = (a - K b)^2 + b²Compute numerator:= (K a - b(1 + K²)) * (a - K b)^2 + (b(1 + K²) - K a ) * [ (a - K b)^2 + b² ]Let me factor out (K a - b(1 + K²)) as - (b(1 + K²) - K a )So, numerator:= - (b(1 + K²) - K a ) * (a - K b)^2 + (b(1 + K²) - K a ) * [ (a - K b)^2 + b² ]Factor out (b(1 + K²) - K a ):= (b(1 + K²) - K a ) [ - (a - K b)^2 + (a - K b)^2 + b² ]Simplify inside the brackets:- (a - K b)^2 + (a - K b)^2 + b² = 0 + b² = b²Therefore, numerator = (b(1 + K²) - K a ) * b²Thus, y = [ (b(1 + K²) - K a ) * b² ] / DWhere D = (a - K b)^2 + b²So, y = [ b² (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / [ (a - K b)^2 + b² ]Therefore, coordinates of O are:x = [a (a - K b)^2] / [ (a - K b)^2 + b² ]y = [ b² (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / [ (a - K b)^2 + b² ]Okay, so now we have coordinates of O in terms of a, b, and K.Now, we need to find angle BOD = 75 degrees.Point B is at (a, 0), point O is at (x, y), and point D is at (d, 0) = (a - K b, 0).So, angle at O between points B, O, D is 75 degrees.To find angle BOD, we can use vector analysis or coordinate geometry.Let me consider vectors OB and OD.Vector OB is from O to B: (a - x, 0 - y)Vector OD is from O to D: (d - x, 0 - y)Then, the angle between vectors OB and OD is 75 degrees.The formula for the angle θ between two vectors u and v is:cosθ = (u · v) / (|u| |v| )So, cos(75°) = [ (a - x)(d - x) + (0 - y)(0 - y) ] / [ sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 ) * sqrt( (d - x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 ) ]Simplify numerator and denominator.First, compute numerator:= (a - x)(d - x) + y²Denominator:= sqrt( (a - x)^2 + y² ) * sqrt( (d - x)^2 + y² )So, let me compute each part.First, compute (a - x):From x = [a (a - K b)^2] / [ (a - K b)^2 + b² ]So, a - x = a - [a (a - K b)^2 / D ] where D = (a - K b)^2 + b²= [ a D - a (a - K b)^2 ] / D= [ a ( (a - K b)^2 + b² ) - a (a - K b)^2 ] / D= [ a (a - K b)^2 + a b² - a (a - K b)^2 ] / D= [ a b² ] / DSimilarly, (d - x):d = a - K bSo, d - x = (a - K b) - [a (a - K b)^2 / D ]= [ (a - K b) D - a (a - K b)^2 ] / D= [ (a - K b)( (a - K b)^2 + b² ) - a (a - K b)^2 ] / D= [ (a - K b)^3 + (a - K b) b² - a (a - K b)^2 ] / DFactor out (a - K b):= (a - K b) [ (a - K b)^2 + b² - a (a - K b) ] / DCompute inside the brackets:= (a - K b)^2 + b² - a (a - K b )= (a² - 2 K a b + K² b² ) + b² - a² + K a b= (a² - 2 K a b + K² b² + b² - a² + K a b )Simplify:a² - a² = 0-2 K a b + K a b = - K a bK² b² + b² = b² (K² + 1 )So, inside the brackets: - K a b + b² (K² + 1 )Therefore,d - x = (a - K b) [ - K a b + b² (K² + 1 ) ] / DFactor out b:= (a - K b) b [ - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ] / DSo, d - x = (a - K b) b [ - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ] / DNow, let's compute (a - x)(d - x):From above, a - x = a b² / DAnd d - x = (a - K b) b [ - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ] / DSo,(a - x)(d - x) = (a b² / D ) * ( (a - K b) b [ - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ] / D )= a b² (a - K b) b [ - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ] / D²= a b³ (a - K b) [ - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ] / D²Similarly, compute y²:From y = [ b² (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / DSo, y² = [ b² (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ]² / D²= b⁴ (b(1 + K²) - K a )² / D²Therefore, numerator:= (a - x)(d - x) + y²= [ a b³ (a - K b) ( - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ) + b⁴ (b(1 + K²) - K a )² ] / D²Let me factor out b³ from both terms:= b³ [ a (a - K b) ( - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ) + b (b(1 + K²) - K a )² ] / D²Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:First term: a (a - K b) ( - K a + b (K² + 1 ) )Second term: b (b(1 + K²) - K a )²Let me compute the first term:a (a - K b) ( - K a + b (K² + 1 ) )Let me expand (a - K b)( - K a + b (K² + 1 ) )Multiply term by term:= a*(-K a) + a*b (K² + 1 ) - K b*(-K a) + (-K b)*b (K² + 1 )= - K a² + a b (K² + 1 ) + K² a b - K b² (K² + 1 )Simplify:- K a² + a b (K² + 1 + K² ) - K b² (K² + 1 )= - K a² + a b (2 K² + 1 ) - K b² (K² + 1 )So, first term is a times that:= a [ - K a² + a b (2 K² + 1 ) - K b² (K² + 1 ) ]= - K a³ + a² b (2 K² + 1 ) - K a b² (K² + 1 )Second term: b (b(1 + K²) - K a )²Let me expand (b(1 + K²) - K a )²:= [b(1 + K²)]² - 2 b(1 + K²) K a + (K a )²= b² (1 + K²)^2 - 2 K a b (1 + K² ) + K² a²Multiply by b:= b³ (1 + K²)^2 - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) + K² a² bSo, the second term is:= b³ (1 + K²)^2 - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) + K² a² bNow, combine first and second terms:Total inside the brackets:First term:- K a³ + a² b (2 K² + 1 ) - K a b² (K² + 1 )Second term:+ b³ (1 + K²)^2 - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) + K² a² bCombine like terms:- K a³+ a² b (2 K² + 1 ) + K² a² b = a² b (2 K² + 1 + K² ) = a² b (3 K² + 1 )- K a b² (K² + 1 ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - K a b² (K² + 1 + 2 (1 + K² )) = Wait, no.Wait, no, actually, the terms are:- K a b² (K² + 1 ) and - 2 K a b² (1 + K² )So, total is - K a b² (K² + 1 ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - K a b² (K² + 1 + 2 (1 + K² )) ?Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, actually, it's - K a b² (K² + 1 ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - K a b² (K² + 1 + 2 (1 + K² )) ?Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me factor out - K a b² (1 + K² ):= - K a b² (1 + K² ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - (1 + 2) K a b² (1 + K² ) = - 3 K a b² (1 + K² )Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, actually:- K a b² (K² + 1 ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - K a b² (K² + 1 + 2 (1 + K² )) ?Wait, no, that's not the way to combine them. Let me see:First term: - K a b² (K² + 1 )Second term: - 2 K a b² (1 + K² )So, total is - K a b² (K² + 1 ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - K a b² (K² + 1 + 2 (1 + K² )) ?Wait, no, that's not correct. It's actually:= - K a b² (K² + 1 ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - K a b² (K² + 1 + 2 (1 + K² )) ?Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently.It's - K a b² (K² + 1 ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - K a b² (K² + 1 + 2 (1 + K² )) ?Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me factor out - K a b² (1 + K² ):= - K a b² (1 + K² ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - (1 + 2) K a b² (1 + K² ) = - 3 K a b² (1 + K² )Wait, that seems correct.Wait, no, because it's - K a b² (K² + 1 ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = - K a b² (K² + 1 + 2 (1 + K² )) ?Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, both terms have (1 + K² ), so:= - K a b² (1 + K² ) - 2 K a b² (1 + K² ) = (-1 - 2) K a b² (1 + K² ) = -3 K a b² (1 + K² )Yes, that's correct.Now, the other terms:+ b³ (1 + K² )²So, putting it all together:Total inside the brackets:- K a³ + a² b (3 K² + 1 ) - 3 K a b² (1 + K² ) + b³ (1 + K² )²So, numerator:= b³ [ - K a³ + a² b (3 K² + 1 ) - 3 K a b² (1 + K² ) + b³ (1 + K² )² ] / D²This is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry, we can compute the slopes of BO and DO, then compute the angle between them.Given that angle BOD is 75 degrees, we can relate the slopes using the tangent formula.Let me try that.First, compute the coordinates of O:x = [a (a - K b)^2] / [ (a - K b)^2 + b² ]y = [ b² (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / [ (a - K b)^2 + b² ]So, point O is (x, y).Point B is (a, 0), point D is (a - K b, 0).So, vector BO is from O to B: (a - x, 0 - y)Vector DO is from O to D: (a - K b - x, 0 - y)So, the angle between vectors BO and DO is 75 degrees.Alternatively, since both vectors have the same y-component, maybe we can compute the angle using the difference in their slopes.Wait, actually, the angle between BO and DO is 75 degrees, so we can use the tangent formula.The tangent of the angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1 m2)|.So, let me compute the slopes of BO and DO.Slope of BO: from O(x, y) to B(a, 0): m1 = (0 - y)/(a - x) = (- y)/(a - x)Slope of DO: from O(x, y) to D(a - K b, 0): m2 = (0 - y)/(a - K b - x) = (- y)/(a - K b - x)So, tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1 m2)|Given that theta = 75 degrees, so tan(theta) = tan(75°) = 2 + sqrt(3)So, let me compute m1 and m2.First, m1 = (- y)/(a - x)From earlier, a - x = a b² / DAnd y = [ b² (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / DSo, m1 = [ - ( b² (b(1 + K²) - K a ) / D ) ] / ( a b² / D ) = [ - (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / aSimilarly, m2 = (- y)/(a - K b - x )From earlier, a - K b - x = d - x = (a - K b) - xWe had computed d - x earlier as (a - K b) b [ - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ] / DBut let me compute a - K b - x:= (a - K b) - x= (a - K b) - [a (a - K b)^2 / D ]= [ (a - K b) D - a (a - K b)^2 ] / D= (a - K b) [ D - a (a - K b) ] / DBut D = (a - K b)^2 + b²So,= (a - K b) [ (a - K b)^2 + b² - a (a - K b) ] / D= (a - K b) [ (a - K b)^2 - a (a - K b) + b² ] / DFactor out (a - K b):= (a - K b) [ (a - K b)(a - K b - a ) + b² ] / D= (a - K b) [ (a - K b)(- K b ) + b² ] / D= (a - K b) [ - K b (a - K b ) + b² ] / D= (a - K b) [ - K a b + K² b² + b² ] / D= (a - K b) [ - K a b + b² (K² + 1 ) ] / DSo, a - K b - x = (a -

K b)( - K a b + b² (K² + 1 ) ) ]Factor out b from numerator and denominator:= [ - b² (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / [ (a - K b) b ( - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ) ]Cancel b:= [ - b (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / [ (a - K b)( - K a + b (K² + 1 ) ) ]Note that (b(1 + K²) - K a ) = - (K a - b(1 + K²))Similarly, (- K a + b (K² + 1 )) = - (K a - b (K² + 1 )) = - (K a - b (1 + K²))Therefore, numerator: - b ( - (K a - b (1 + K²)) ) = b (K a - b (1 + K²))Denominator: (a - K b)( - (K a - b (1 + K²)) ) = - (a - K b)(K a - b (1 + K²))So, m2 = [ b (K a - b (1 + K²)) ] / [ - (a - K b)(K a - b (1 + K²)) ] = - b / (a - K b )So, m2 = - b / (a - K b )Similarly, earlier, m1 = [ - (b(1 + K²) - K a ) ] / a = [ K a - b(1 + K²) ] / aSo, m1 = (K a - b(1 + K²)) / aNow, tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1 m2)|Given theta = 75°, tan(theta) = 2 + sqrt(3)Compute numerator: m2 - m1 = [ - b / (a - K b ) ] - [ (K a - b(1 + K²)) / a ]= [ - b / (a - K b ) - (K a - b(1 + K²)) / a ]Let me compute this:= [ - b a - (K a - b(1 + K²))(a - K b ) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]Wait, no, to subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator.Alternatively, compute each term separately.First term: - b / (a - K b )Second term: - (K a - b(1 + K²)) / aSo, m2 - m1 = [ - b / (a - K b ) ] - [ (K a - b(1 + K²)) / a ]Let me write this as:= [ - b / (a - K b ) ] - [ (K a - b(1 + K²)) / a ]To combine these, find a common denominator, which is a (a - K b )So,= [ - b a - (K a - b(1 + K²))(a - K b ) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]Compute numerator:= - a b - [ K a (a - K b ) - b(1 + K²)(a - K b ) ]= - a b - [ K a² - K² a b - b a (1 + K² ) + K b² (1 + K² ) ]= - a b - K a² + K² a b + b a (1 + K² ) - K b² (1 + K² )Simplify term by term:- a b - K a² + K² a b + a b (1 + K² ) - K b² (1 + K² )= - a b - K a² + K² a b + a b + K² a b - K b² (1 + K² )Simplify:- a b + a b = 0- K a²K² a b + K² a b = 2 K² a b- K b² (1 + K² )So, numerator = - K a² + 2 K² a b - K b² (1 + K² )Factor out - K:= - K [ a² - 2 K a b + b² (1 + K² ) ]So, numerator = - K [ a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b² ]Denominator = a (a - K b )So, m2 - m1 = [ - K ( a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b² ) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]Now, compute 1 + m1 m2:m1 = (K a - b(1 + K² )) / am2 = - b / (a - K b )So, m1 m2 = [ (K a - b(1 + K² )) / a ] * [ - b / (a - K b ) ]= [ - b (K a - b(1 + K² )) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]Note that (K a - b(1 + K² )) = - (b(1 + K² ) - K a )So, m1 m2 = [ - b ( - (b(1 + K² ) - K a ) ) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]= [ b (b(1 + K² ) - K a ) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]Thus, 1 + m1 m2 = 1 + [ b (b(1 + K² ) - K a ) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]= [ a (a - K b ) + b (b(1 + K² ) - K a ) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]Compute numerator:= a (a - K b ) + b (b(1 + K² ) - K a )= a² - K a b + b² (1 + K² ) - K a b= a² - 2 K a b + b² (1 + K² )So, 1 + m1 m2 = [ a² - 2 K a b + b² (1 + K² ) ] / [ a (a - K b ) ]Therefore, tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1 m2)| = | [ - K ( a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b² ) / ( a (a - K b ) ) ] / [ ( a² - 2 K a b + b² (1 + K² ) ) / ( a (a - K b ) ) ] |Simplify:= | [ - K ( a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b² ) ] / ( a² - 2 K a b + b² (1 + K² ) ) |But notice that a² - 2 K a b + b² + K² b² = a² - 2 K a b + b² (1 + K² )So, numerator and denominator are the same except for the K factor.Therefore,tan(theta) = | - K | = KSince K is a positive ratio, tan(theta) = KBut theta is 75°, so tan(75°) = KWe know that tan(75°) = 2 + sqrt(3)Therefore, K = 2 + sqrt(3)So, the value of K is 2 + sqrt(3)**Final Answer**The value of ( K ) is (boxed{2 + sqrt{3}})."},{"question":"Terez has 44 cows on his farm.  50 percent of the cows are female, and 50 percent of the females are pregnant.

For any x in mathbb{R}, it always holds that f(x+4)=f(x)+f(4). Find the value of f(2012).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of ( f(2012) ) given some properties of the function ( y = f(x) ). Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the function is an odd function defined on all real numbers. I remember that an odd function satisfies the condition ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) for every ( x ) in its domain. That might come in handy later.Next, it's given that ( f(2) = 0 ). Hmm, that's a specific value which might be useful when trying to find a pattern or a general formula for ( f(x) ).The other condition is that for any real number ( x ), the function satisfies ( f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(4) ). This looks like a functional equation. I think this kind of equation suggests that the function has some periodic or linear behavior. Let me explore that.Let me consider the functional equation ( f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(4) ). Maybe I can find a general expression for ( f(x) ) using this. Let's try plugging in different values for ( x ) and see if a pattern emerges.If I let ( x = 0 ), then the equation becomes:( f(0 + 4) = f(0) + f(4) )Which simplifies to:( f(4) = f(0) + f(4) )Subtracting ( f(4) ) from both sides gives:( 0 = f(0) )So, ( f(0) = 0 ). That's a good start.Now, since the function is odd, we know that ( f(-0) = -f(0) ), which is just ( 0 = -0 ), so that doesn't give us new information, but it's consistent.Let me try to see if the function is linear. Suppose ( f(x) = kx ) for some constant ( k ). Let's test if this satisfies the functional equation.If ( f(x) = kx ), then:( f(x + 4) = k(x + 4) = kx + 4k )On the other hand, ( f(x) + f(4) = kx + 4k )So, yes, it does satisfy the equation. That suggests that a linear function might be a solution. But is it the only solution?Wait, the problem doesn't specify that the function is linear, just that it's odd and satisfies that functional equation. So maybe it's linear, but perhaps there are other solutions too. Hmm.But let's see if we can use the given information to find ( f(4) ). If ( f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(4) ), then perhaps we can iterate this equation to find a general form.Let me try to compute ( f(x + 4n) ) for some integer ( n ). Using the functional equation recursively, we can write:( f(x + 4n) = f(x) + n f(4) )That seems to be the case. For example, if ( n = 1 ), it's the original equation. If ( n = 2 ), then:( f(x + 8) = f(x + 4) + f(4) = f(x) + f(4) + f(4) = f(x) + 2f(4) )Similarly, for ( n = 3 ):( f(x + 12) = f(x + 8) + f(4) = f(x) + 2f(4) + f(4) = f(x) + 3f(4) )So, in general, ( f(x + 4n) = f(x) + n f(4) ). That seems correct.Now, since we're dealing with ( f(2012) ), let's see how 2012 relates to 4. Well, 2012 divided by 4 is 503, so 2012 is 4 times 503. So, 2012 = 4 * 503. That suggests that if we set ( x = 0 ) and ( n = 503 ), we can write:( f(0 + 4*503) = f(0) + 503 f(4) )Which simplifies to:( f(2012) = 0 + 503 f(4) )So, ( f(2012) = 503 f(4) ). Therefore, if I can find the value of ( f(4) ), I can find ( f(2012) ).So, how can I find ( f(4) )? Let's think about the given information. We know that ( f(2) = 0 ) and the function is odd. Maybe we can relate ( f(4) ) to ( f(2) ) somehow.Let me try plugging ( x = 2 ) into the functional equation:( f(2 + 4) = f(2) + f(4) )Which simplifies to:( f(6) = 0 + f(4) )So, ( f(6) = f(4) ).Now, let's try plugging ( x = 6 ) into the functional equation:( f(6 + 4) = f(6) + f(4) )Which is:( f(10) = f(4) + f(4) = 2f(4) )Similarly, if I plug ( x = 10 ):( f(14) = f(10) + f(4) = 2f(4) + f(4) = 3f(4) )I see a pattern here. It seems that ( f(4n) = n f(4) ) for integer ( n ). Wait, but 4n is just multiples of 4, so that makes sense given the functional equation.But how does this help me find ( f(4) )?Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the function is odd. Let me recall that ( f(-x) = -f(x) ). So, perhaps I can find another equation involving ( f(4) ).Let me try plugging ( x = -2 ) into the functional equation:( f(-2 + 4) = f(-2) + f(4) )Simplify:( f(2) = f(-2) + f(4) )But ( f(2) = 0 ), and since the function is odd, ( f(-2) = -f(2) = -0 = 0 ). So, substituting:( 0 = 0 + f(4) )Which implies ( f(4) = 0 ).Oh, that's useful! So, ( f(4) = 0 ). Therefore, going back to the earlier equation:( f(2012) = 503 f(4) = 503 * 0 = 0 )So, ( f(2012) = 0 ).Wait, let me double-check that step where I plugged in ( x = -2 ). So, ( f(-2 + 4) = f(-2) + f(4) ). That simplifies to ( f(2) = f(-2) + f(4) ). Since ( f(2) = 0 ) and ( f(-2) = -f(2) = 0 ), so indeed ( 0 = 0 + f(4) ), which gives ( f(4) = 0 ). That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can find another way to confirm ( f(4) = 0 ). Let's see.We know that ( f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(4) ). If I set ( x = 4 ), then:( f(8) = f(4) + f(4) = 2f(4) )Similarly, setting ( x = 8 ):( f(12) = f(8) + f(4) = 2f(4) + f(4) = 3f(4) )And so on. So, ( f(4n) = n f(4) ). But since ( f(4) = 0 ), all these values become zero. So, ( f(4n) = 0 ) for any integer ( n ). That makes sense.But wait, is there a way to relate ( f(4) ) to ( f(2) ) without using the oddness? Let's see.We have ( f(6) = f(4) ) from earlier, by plugging ( x = 2 ). So, ( f(6) = f(4) ). But if I plug ( x = 6 ) into the functional equation, I get ( f(10) = f(6) + f(4) = f(4) + f(4) = 2f(4) ). Similarly, ( f(14) = 3f(4) ), etc. But without knowing ( f(4) ), I can't get much further.But using the oddness, I was able to find ( f(4) = 0 ). So that seems solid.Therefore, since ( f(4) = 0 ), ( f(2012) = 503 * 0 = 0 ).Wait, just to make sure, let me try another approach. Suppose I consider the function ( f(x) ) as linear, which we saw earlier satisfies the functional equation. If ( f(x) = kx ), then since it's odd, that's fine because ( f(-x) = -kx = -f(x) ). Also, ( f(2) = 2k = 0 ), which implies ( k = 0 ). So, the function is identically zero. Therefore, ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ), which would make ( f(2012) = 0 ).But wait, is the function necessarily linear? The problem didn't specify that it's linear, just that it's odd and satisfies the functional equation. So, could there be a non-linear function that satisfies these conditions?Let me think. Suppose ( f(x) ) is not linear. For example, maybe it's periodic or something else. But the functional equation ( f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(4) ) suggests that the function has a linear component, because each time you increase ( x ) by 4, the function increases by a constant ( f(4) ). That's characteristic of a linear function.In fact, if we define ( g(x) = f(x) - frac{f(4)}{4}x ), then perhaps ( g(x) ) is periodic with period 4. Let me check:( g(x + 4) = f(x + 4) - frac{f(4)}{4}(x + 4) = f(x) + f(4) - frac{f(4)}{4}x - f(4) = f(x) - frac{f(4)}{4}x = g(x) )So, ( g(x + 4) = g(x) ), meaning ( g ) is periodic with period 4. Therefore, ( f(x) = frac{f(4)}{4}x + g(x) ), where ( g ) is periodic with period 4.But since ( f ) is an odd function, let's see what that implies for ( g(x) ).( f(-x) = -f(x) )So,( frac{f(4)}{4}(-x) + g(-x) = -left( frac{f(4)}{4}x + g(x) right) )Simplify:( -frac{f(4)}{4}x + g(-x) = -frac{f(4)}{4}x - g(x) )Cancel out the ( -frac{f(4)}{4}x ) terms:( g(-x) = -g(x) )So, ( g(x) ) is also an odd function.Therefore, ( g(x) ) is an odd function with period 4. So, ( g(x + 4) = g(x) ) and ( g(-x) = -g(x) ).Now, if ( g(x) ) is periodic and odd, can we say anything else about it? Well, without more information, it's hard to pin down ( g(x) ). However, we do know that ( f(2) = 0 ). Let's use that.( f(2) = frac{f(4)}{4} * 2 + g(2) = frac{f(4)}{2} + g(2) = 0 )So, ( frac{f(4)}{2} + g(2) = 0 )Which implies ( g(2) = -frac{f(4)}{2} )But since ( g(x) ) is periodic with period 4, ( g(2) = g(2 + 4k) ) for any integer ( k ). So, ( g(2) = g(6) = g(10) = dots ). Also, since ( g ) is odd, ( g(-2) = -g(2) ).But let's see if we can find another equation involving ( g(2) ). Let's compute ( f(6) ):( f(6) = frac{f(4)}{4} * 6 + g(6) = frac{3f(4)}{2} + g(6) )But from earlier, we know that ( f(6) = f(4) ). So,( frac{3f(4)}{2} + g(6) = f(4) )Subtract ( frac{3f(4)}{2} ) from both sides:( g(6) = f(4) - frac{3f(4)}{2} = -frac{f(4)}{2} )But since ( g(6) = g(2) ) (because period is 4), we have:( g(2) = -frac{f(4)}{2} )Which matches our earlier result.So, we have ( g(2) = -frac{f(4)}{2} ). But is there another way to express ( g(2) )?Wait, let's compute ( f(-2) ). Since ( f ) is odd, ( f(-2) = -f(2) = 0 ). So,( f(-2) = frac{f(4)}{4}*(-2) + g(-2) = -frac{f(4)}{2} + g(-2) = 0 )But ( g(-2) = -g(2) ), so:( -frac{f(4)}{2} - g(2) = 0 )Which implies:( -g(2) = frac{f(4)}{2} )So, ( g(2) = -frac{f(4)}{2} )Again, same result.So, it seems consistent. But how does this help us? We still have two variables: ( f(4) ) and ( g(2) ). But since ( g(2) = -frac{f(4)}{2} ), we can't determine ( f(4) ) unless we have another equation.Wait, but earlier, we found that ( f(4) = 0 ) by using the oddness condition. Let me verify that again.From ( x = -2 ):( f(-2 + 4) = f(-2) + f(4) )Which is ( f(2) = f(-2) + f(4) )Since ( f(2) = 0 ) and ( f(-2) = -f(2) = 0 ), we have:( 0 = 0 + f(4) )Therefore, ( f(4) = 0 )So, that's a solid conclusion. Therefore, ( f(4) = 0 ). So, going back to the expression for ( f(x) ):( f(x) = frac{f(4)}{4}x + g(x) = 0 + g(x) = g(x) )So, ( f(x) = g(x) ). But ( g(x) ) is periodic with period 4 and is odd. So, ( f(x) ) is a periodic odd function with period 4.But wait, if ( f(x) ) is periodic with period 4, then ( f(x + 4) = f(x) ). However, the functional equation says ( f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(4) ). Since ( f(4) = 0 ), this reduces to ( f(x + 4) = f(x) ), which is consistent with periodicity.So, ( f(x) ) is a periodic odd function with period 4. But we also know that ( f(2) = 0 ). So, ( f(2) = 0 ), and since it's periodic, ( f(2 + 4k) = 0 ) for any integer ( k ). Therefore, ( f(2012) = f(4*503) = f(0) = 0 ). Wait, but 2012 is 4*503, so ( f(2012) = f(0) = 0 ). Alternatively, since 2012 is a multiple of 4, and ( f(4) = 0 ), so ( f(2012) = 0 ).Alternatively, since ( f(x) ) is periodic with period 4, ( f(2012) = f(2012 mod 4) ). Let's compute ( 2012 mod 4 ). Since 2012 divided by 4 is 503 with no remainder, ( 2012 mod 4 = 0 ). Therefore, ( f(2012) = f(0) = 0 ).So, that's another way to see it.Wait, but earlier, I thought ( f(x) = g(x) ), which is periodic with period 4. So, ( f(2012) = f(0) = 0 ). That's consistent.But let me also think about the function being linear. If ( f(4) = 0 ), then the linear function would be ( f(x) = 0 ), which is indeed an odd function and satisfies all the given conditions.So, whether ( f(x) ) is linear or just periodic and odd, in both cases, ( f(2012) = 0 ).Therefore, I think I can confidently say that ( f(2012) = 0 ).**Final Answer**The value of ( f(2012) ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a common difference of 2, and a_2 is the geometric mean of a_1 and a_5, then the value of a_3 is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:\\"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a common difference of 2, and a_2 is the geometric mean of a_1 and a_5, then the value of a_3 is ______.\\"Alright, so first, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a common difference to the previous term. Here, the common difference is given as 2. So, if I denote the first term as a_1, then:a_2 = a_1 + 2a_3 = a_1 + 4a_4 = a_1 + 6a_5 = a_1 + 8And so on. So, each term increases by 2.Now, the problem also mentions that a_2 is the geometric mean of a_1 and a_5. Hmm, geometric mean. I recall that the geometric mean of two numbers, say x and y, is the square root of their product. So, the geometric mean of a_1 and a_5 would be sqrt(a_1 * a_5). Therefore, according to the problem:a_2 = sqrt(a_1 * a_5)Since I already have expressions for a_2 and a_5 in terms of a_1, I can substitute those in.So, substituting:a_1 + 2 = sqrt(a_1 * (a_1 + 8))Let me write that equation down:a_1 + 2 = sqrt(a_1^2 + 8a_1)Hmm, okay. So, I have an equation involving a_1. Let me try to solve for a_1.First, to eliminate the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. That should help me get rid of the square root and make it easier to solve.So, squaring both sides:(a_1 + 2)^2 = (sqrt(a_1^2 + 8a_1))^2Simplifying both sides:Left side: (a_1 + 2)^2 = a_1^2 + 4a_1 + 4Right side: a_1^2 + 8a_1So, now we have:a_1^2 + 4a_1 + 4 = a_1^2 + 8a_1Hmm, okay. Let me subtract a_1^2 from both sides to simplify:(a_1^2 + 4a_1 + 4) - a_1^2 = (a_1^2 + 8a_1) - a_1^2Which simplifies to:4a_1 + 4 = 8a_1Now, let's subtract 4a_1 from both sides:4a_1 + 4 - 4a_1 = 8a_1 - 4a_1Simplifying:4 = 4a_1So, 4a_1 = 4Divide both sides by 4:a_1 = 1Okay, so the first term is 1. Now, the problem is asking for a_3. Since this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, a_3 is:a_3 = a_1 + 2*(3-1) = a_1 + 4Wait, hold on, let me think. Actually, in an arithmetic sequence, each term is a_1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference. So, for a_3, n=3, so:a_3 = a_1 + (3-1)*2 = a_1 + 4Since a_1 is 1, then:a_3 = 1 + 4 = 5So, a_3 is 5.But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I wrote down the expressions for a_2 and a_5 in terms of a_1, which seems correct.2. Then, I set up the equation a_2 = sqrt(a_1 * a_5), which is given as the geometric mean. That seems right.3. Substituted the expressions:a_1 + 2 = sqrt(a_1*(a_1 + 8))4. Squared both sides:(a_1 + 2)^2 = a_1^2 + 8a_1Which expanded to:a_1^2 + 4a_1 + 4 = a_1^2 + 8a_15. Subtracted a_1^2:4a_1 + 4 = 8a_16. Subtracted 4a_1:4 = 4a_17. So, a_1 = 18. Then, a_3 = a_1 + 4 = 5Wait, that seems consistent. Let me just verify by plugging back into the original condition.If a_1 = 1, then:a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3a_5 = 1 + 8 = 9So, the geometric mean of a_1 and a_5 is sqrt(1*9) = sqrt(9) = 3, which is equal to a_2. So, that checks out.Therefore, a_3 is indeed 5.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The value of ( a_3 ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"Given that the function y=f(x) has an inverse function denoted as y=f^{-1}(x), and the function y=f(x) passes through the point P(2, -1), then f^{-1}(-1) = ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function y = f(x) has an inverse function y = f⁻¹(x). It also says that the function y = f(x) passes through the point P(2, -1). Then, I need to find f⁻¹(-1). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if a function has an inverse, then the inverse function essentially \\"reverses\\" the original function. That means if f(x) maps x to y, then f⁻¹(y) maps y back to x. So, in mathematical terms, if f(a) = b, then f⁻¹(b) = a. That seems right.Given that, the function f passes through the point P(2, -1). So, that means when x is 2, y is -1. In other words, f(2) = -1. So, f(2) = -1.Now, since f has an inverse function, f⁻¹, then by the property I just recalled, f⁻¹(-1) should be equal to 2. Because if f(2) = -1, then applying the inverse function to -1 should give me back the original input, which is 2.Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. So, f maps 2 to -1, so f(2) = -1. Therefore, f⁻¹ should map -1 back to 2. So, f⁻¹(-1) = 2. That seems straightforward.Is there anything else I need to consider here? Maybe I should double-check the definition of inverse functions. The inverse function f⁻¹ is defined such that f(f⁻¹(x)) = x and f⁻¹(f(x)) = x, right? So, if I plug -1 into f⁻¹, I should get the value that when plugged into f gives me -1. Which is exactly 2, as given by the point P(2, -1).So, yeah, that seems consistent. So, f⁻¹(-1) is 2.Wait, just to think about it another way, maybe I can visualize it. If the graph of f passes through (2, -1), then the graph of its inverse function f⁻¹ should pass through (-1, 2). Because inverse functions are reflections over the line y = x. So, reflecting the point (2, -1) over y = x would give me (-1, 2). So, that means f⁻¹(-1) = 2. Yep, that checks out.Is there a chance I could have messed up the coordinates? Let me see. If f(a) = b, then f⁻¹(b) = a. So, in this case, a is 2 and b is -1. So, f⁻¹(-1) = 2. So, no, I don't think I mixed up the coordinates.Another way to think about it: if I have a function and its inverse, their graphs are symmetric with respect to the line y = x. So, if one point is (2, -1), the inverse function would have the point (-1, 2). So, when x is -1, y is 2 for the inverse function. Therefore, f⁻¹(-1) = 2.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It all lines up with the properties of inverse functions. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 2.**Final Answer**The value of ( f^{-1}(-1) ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Wario is a field goal kicker on the high school football team.

Then, I also have to find all the cases where equality holds.Hmm, okay. So, it's an inequality involving a sum of variables squared on the left and a cyclic sum on the right. I think I can approach this using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or maybe by expanding both sides and comparing coefficients. Let me try expanding both sides first to see what's going on.First, let's denote ( S = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_6 ). Then, the left-hand side is ( S^2 ).Expanding ( S^2 ), we get:[S^2 = sum_{i=1}^6 x_i^2 + 2sum_{1 leq i < j leq 6} x_i x_j]So, that's the left side. Now, the right side is ( C ) times a cyclic sum. Let me write out that cyclic sum explicitly.The cyclic sum is:[x_1(x_2 + x_3) + x_2(x_3 + x_4) + x_3(x_4 + x_5) + x_4(x_5 + x_6) + x_5(x_6 + x_1) + x_6(x_1 + x_2)]Let me expand this:[x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3 + x_2x_4 + x_3x_4 + x_3x_5 + x_4x_5 + x_4x_6 + x_5x_6 + x_5x_1 + x_6x_1 + x_6x_2]Hmm, so that's the cyclic sum. Let me count how many times each pair appears. For example, ( x_1x_2 ) appears once in ( x_1x_2 ) and once in ( x_6x_2 ). Wait, actually, let's list all the terms:- ( x_1x_2 )- ( x_1x_3 )- ( x_2x_3 )- ( x_2x_4 )- ( x_3x_4 )- ( x_3x_5 )- ( x_4x_5 )- ( x_4x_6 )- ( x_5x_6 )- ( x_5x_1 )- ( x_6x_1 )- ( x_6x_2 )So, each adjacent pair is included once, but also some non-adjacent pairs. Wait, actually, in a cyclic manner, each variable is multiplied by the next two variables. So, each variable is multiplied by the next two in the cycle.So, in total, each pair ( x_i x_j ) where ( j = i+1 ) or ( j = i+2 ) (mod 6) is included once. So, for each ( x_i ), it's multiplied by ( x_{i+1} ) and ( x_{i+2} ).Therefore, the cyclic sum can be written as:[sum_{i=1}^6 x_i (x_{i+1} + x_{i+2})]Where indices are modulo 6.So, the right-hand side is ( C ) times this sum.Now, going back to the left-hand side, which is ( S^2 ). Let me write both sides again:Left: ( S^2 = sum x_i^2 + 2sum_{i < j} x_i x_j )Right: ( C cdot sum_{i=1}^6 x_i (x_{i+1} + x_{i+2}) )So, to compare these, maybe I can express both sides in terms of the same terms.Let me denote the cyclic sum as ( T = sum_{i=1}^6 x_i (x_{i+1} + x_{i+2}) ). So, the inequality is ( S^2 geq C T ).I need to find the maximum ( C ) such that this holds for all real numbers ( x_i ).Alternatively, this can be thought of as finding the minimal value of ( frac{S^2}{T} ) over all non-zero ( x_i ), and then ( C ) would be the minimal such value.But perhaps another approach is to write this inequality as:( S^2 - C T geq 0 )Which must hold for all real numbers ( x_i ). Therefore, the quadratic form ( S^2 - C T ) must be non-negative definite.So, maybe I can represent this as a quadratic form and find the conditions on ( C ) such that it's non-negative.Alternatively, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.Wait, another idea: maybe express ( S^2 ) in terms of ( T ) and some other terms, and then find the minimal coefficient.Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to minimize ( frac{S^2}{T} ) subject to some constraint, say ( T = 1 ), but that might get complicated.Alternatively, perhaps assume some symmetry in the variables. Maybe set all variables equal? Let me test that.Suppose ( x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_6 = k ). Then, ( S = 6k ), so ( S^2 = 36k^2 ).The cyclic sum ( T ) would be:Each term is ( k(k + k) = 2k^2 ), and there are 6 terms, so ( T = 6 times 2k^2 = 12k^2 ).Therefore, the inequality becomes ( 36k^2 geq C times 12k^2 ), which simplifies to ( 36 geq 12C ), so ( C leq 3 ).Hmm, so that gives an upper bound of 3 for ( C ). But is this the maximum? Or can ( C ) be larger?Wait, but actually, if all variables are equal, then ( C ) can be at most 3. But maybe for other configurations of ( x_i ), ( C ) has to be smaller. So, perhaps 3 is not the maximum.Wait, actually, when all variables are equal, the ratio ( frac{S^2}{T} = frac{36k^2}{12k^2} = 3 ). So, if ( C ) is larger than 3, then for this case, the inequality would fail. So, ( C ) cannot be larger than 3. But is 3 achievable? Or is there another case where the ratio is smaller?Wait, perhaps another test case. Let me set some variables to zero and see.Suppose ( x_1 = x_2 = 1 ) and the rest are zero. Then, ( S = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2 ), so ( S^2 = 4 ).The cyclic sum ( T ) would be:( x_1(x_2 + x_3) = 1(1 + 0) = 1 )( x_2(x_3 + x_4) = 1(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_3(x_4 + x_5) = 0(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_4(x_5 + x_6) = 0(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_5(x_6 + x_1) = 0(0 + 1) = 0 )( x_6(x_1 + x_2) = 0(1 + 1) = 0 )So, ( T = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 )Therefore, the inequality becomes ( 4 geq C times 1 ), so ( C leq 4 ).Wait, that's higher than the previous case. So, in this case, ( C ) can be up to 4. But earlier, when all variables are equal, ( C ) can only be up to 3. So, that suggests that 3 is the minimal upper bound? Wait, no, because the inequality must hold for all real numbers. So, if in one case ( C ) must be at most 3, and in another case, it can be up to 4, but since the inequality must hold for all cases, ( C ) must be at most 3 because in the first case, if ( C ) is 4, the inequality would fail.Wait, no, actually, in the first case, when all variables are equal, ( C ) can't be more than 3, but in the second case, when only two variables are non-zero, ( C ) can be up to 4. So, the minimal upper bound is 3, because if ( C ) is 3, then in the first case, the inequality holds as equality, and in the second case, it's ( 4 geq 3 times 1 ), which is true. So, ( C ) can be 3.But wait, is 3 actually the maximum? Or is there another case where ( C ) has to be smaller?Let me test another case. Suppose ( x_1 = 1 ), ( x_2 = 1 ), ( x_3 = -1 ), and the rest are zero. Let's compute ( S ) and ( T ).( S = 1 + 1 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 ), so ( S^2 = 1 ).Compute ( T ):( x_1(x_2 + x_3) = 1(1 + (-1)) = 0 )( x_2(x_3 + x_4) = 1(-1 + 0) = -1 )( x_3(x_4 + x_5) = (-1)(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_4(x_5 + x_6) = 0(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_5(x_6 + x_1) = 0(0 + 1) = 0 )( x_6(x_1 + x_2) = 0(1 + 1) = 0 )So, ( T = 0 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -1 )Therefore, the inequality becomes ( 1 geq C times (-1) ), which is ( 1 geq -C ). Since ( C ) is a constant, this doesn't impose any new constraints because ( C ) is positive (as the inequality must hold for all real numbers, including positive and negative). So, this case doesn't affect the value of ( C ).Another test case: let me set ( x_1 = 1 ), ( x_2 = 1 ), ( x_3 = 1 ), ( x_4 = 1 ), ( x_5 = 1 ), ( x_6 = 1 ). Wait, that's the same as all variables equal, which we already did.Alternatively, set ( x_1 = 1 ), ( x_2 = -1 ), and the rest zero. Then, ( S = 1 - 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ), so ( S^2 = 0 ).Compute ( T ):( x_1(x_2 + x_3) = 1(-1 + 0) = -1 )( x_2(x_3 + x_4) = (-1)(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_3(x_4 + x_5) = 0(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_4(x_5 + x_6) = 0(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_5(x_6 + x_1) = 0(0 + 1) = 0 )( x_6(x_1 + x_2) = 0(1 + (-1)) = 0 )So, ( T = -1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -1 )Thus, the inequality becomes ( 0 geq C times (-1) ), which is ( 0 geq -C ), which is always true for ( C geq 0 ). So, again, no new information.Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let's consider the inequality as a quadratic form.Let me denote the vector ( mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6)^T ).Then, ( S = mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x} ), where ( mathbf{1} ) is the vector of ones.So, ( S^2 = (mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x})^2 ).The cyclic sum ( T ) can be written as ( mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x} ), where ( A ) is a symmetric matrix with ones in the positions corresponding to the cyclic terms.Wait, actually, let me think about it. The cyclic sum is:( T = sum_{i=1}^6 x_i x_{i+1} + sum_{i=1}^6 x_i x_{i+2} )So, it's the sum of adjacent pairs and next-adjacent pairs.Therefore, the matrix ( A ) would have 1s in the positions corresponding to ( (i, i+1) ), ( (i+1, i) ), ( (i, i+2) ), and ( (i+2, i) ) for each ( i ), with indices modulo 6.So, for example, the first row of ( A ) would have 1s in columns 2 and 3, and similarly for other rows.Therefore, ( T = mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x} ).So, the inequality is:[(mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x})^2 geq C cdot mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x}]Which can be rewritten as:[mathbf{x}^T (mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T) mathbf{x} geq C cdot mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x}]Or,[mathbf{x}^T (mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T - C A) mathbf{x} geq 0]So, for this inequality to hold for all real vectors ( mathbf{x} ), the matrix ( mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T - C A ) must be positive semi-definite.Therefore, the largest ( C ) such that ( mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T - C A ) is positive semi-definite is the maximum ( C ) we are looking for.To find this ( C ), we can consider the generalized eigenvalue problem:[mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x} = lambda A mathbf{x}]The smallest ( lambda ) for which this holds will give us the maximum ( C ) such that ( C leq lambda ).Alternatively, since ( mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T ) is a rank-1 matrix, and ( A ) is symmetric, perhaps we can find the maximum ( C ) such that ( mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T - C A ) is positive semi-definite by looking at the minimum eigenvalue.But this might be complicated because ( A ) is a 6x6 matrix, and computing eigenvalues might be tedious.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that for any vector ( mathbf{x} ), the inequality ( (mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x})^2 geq C mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x} ) must hold. So, the minimal value of ( frac{(mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x})^2}{mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x}} ) over all non-zero ( mathbf{x} ) is equal to ( C ).Therefore, ( C ) is the minimal value of ( frac{(mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x})^2}{mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x}} ).To find this minimal value, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the optimization problem.We need to minimize ( f(mathbf{x}) = frac{(mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x})^2}{mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x}} ).Let me denote ( S = mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x} ) and ( T = mathbf{x}^T A mathbf{x} ). So, ( f = frac{S^2}{T} ).To minimize ( f ), we can set up the Lagrangian:[mathcal{L} = frac{S^2}{T} + lambda (T - 1)]Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to use the method of Lagrange multipliers with the constraint ( T = 1 ), so we can write:We need to minimize ( S^2 ) subject to ( T = 1 ).So, the Lagrangian is:[mathcal{L} = S^2 - lambda (T - 1)]Taking partial derivatives with respect to each ( x_i ), set them equal to zero.Compute ( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial x_i} = 2 S - lambda cdot frac{partial T}{partial x_i} = 0 ).So, ( 2 S = lambda cdot frac{partial T}{partial x_i} ) for each ( i ).But ( T = sum_{i=1}^6 x_i (x_{i+1} + x_{i+2}) ), so ( frac{partial T}{partial x_i} = x_{i-1} + x_{i-2} + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} ), considering the cyclic nature.Wait, let me compute ( frac{partial T}{partial x_i} ):Each ( x_i ) appears in the terms ( x_{i-2} x_i ), ( x_{i-1} x_i ), ( x_i x_{i+1} ), and ( x_i x_{i+2} ). So, the derivative is ( x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} ).Therefore, ( frac{partial T}{partial x_i} = x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} ).So, the condition is:[2 S = lambda (x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2})]For each ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 6 ).This gives a system of equations:For each ( i ),[x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} = frac{2 S}{lambda}]Since the right-hand side is a constant for all ( i ), this suggests that the left-hand side is the same for all ( i ).Therefore, for each ( i ), the sum of ( x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} ) is equal to some constant.This suggests that the vector ( mathbf{x} ) is such that each of these sums is equal.This seems like a circulant system, which might have solutions with some symmetry.Perhaps, let's assume that the vector ( mathbf{x} ) is such that ( x_i = a ) for all ( i ). Let's test this.If ( x_i = a ) for all ( i ), then ( S = 6a ), and ( T = 12a^2 ) as before.Then, the condition ( 2 S = lambda cdot frac{partial T}{partial x_i} ).Compute ( frac{partial T}{partial x_i} = x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} = 4a ).So, ( 2 times 6a = lambda times 4a ), which gives ( 12a = 4a lambda ), so ( lambda = 3 ).So, that works. So, the uniform vector is a critical point.But is this the only critical point? Or are there others?Perhaps, another case where the vector ( mathbf{x} ) has a certain periodicity. For example, maybe ( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = a ) and ( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = b ).Let me try this.Let ( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = a ) and ( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = b ).Then, ( S = 3a + 3b ).Compute ( T ):Each ( x_i ) is multiplied by the next two. So, for ( x_1 = a ), it's multiplied by ( x_2 + x_3 = b + a ).Similarly, ( x_2 = b ) is multiplied by ( x_3 + x_4 = a + b ).And so on. So, each term in ( T ) is either ( a(b + a) ) or ( b(a + b) ).Since the pattern repeats every two variables, each pair contributes ( a(b + a) + b(a + b) = 2ab + a^2 + b^2 ).But since there are 6 terms, each contributing this, but wait, actually, each term is either ( a(b + a) ) or ( b(a + b) ), but in the cyclic sum, each adjacent pair is counted once.Wait, actually, let's compute ( T ):( x_1(x_2 + x_3) = a(b + a) )( x_2(x_3 + x_4) = b(a + b) )( x_3(x_4 + x_5) = a(b + a) )( x_4(x_5 + x_6) = b(a + b) )( x_5(x_6 + x_1) = a(b + a) )( x_6(x_1 + x_2) = b(a + b) )So, in total, ( T = 3a(a + b) + 3b(a + b) = 3(a + b)^2 ).So, ( T = 3(a + b)^2 ).Then, ( S = 3(a + b) ), so ( S^2 = 9(a + b)^2 ).Therefore, the ratio ( frac{S^2}{T} = frac{9(a + b)^2}{3(a + b)^2} = 3 ).So, again, the ratio is 3.So, in this case, the ratio is 3, same as when all variables are equal.But earlier, when only two variables are non-zero, the ratio was 4. So, is 3 the minimal ratio?Wait, but in that case, the ratio was 4, which is higher than 3, so 3 is still the minimal.Wait, but when I set ( x_1 = x_2 = 1 ) and the rest zero, the ratio was 4. So, in that case, the ratio is higher, meaning that the minimal ratio is 3, so ( C = 3 ).But wait, actually, in that case, the ratio was 4, which is higher, so the minimal ratio is 3, so ( C ) can be at most 3.But to confirm, let me see if there exists a vector ( mathbf{x} ) where the ratio ( frac{S^2}{T} ) is less than 3.Suppose I set ( x_1 = 1 ), ( x_2 = t ), and the rest zero. Let's compute ( S ) and ( T ) in terms of ( t ).So, ( S = 1 + t ).Compute ( T ):( x_1(x_2 + x_3) = 1(t + 0) = t )( x_2(x_3 + x_4) = t(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_3(x_4 + x_5) = 0(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_4(x_5 + x_6) = 0(0 + 0) = 0 )( x_5(x_6 + x_1) = 0(0 + 1) = 0 )( x_6(x_1 + x_2) = 0(1 + t) = 0 )So, ( T = t ).Therefore, the ratio ( frac{S^2}{T} = frac{(1 + t)^2}{t} ).We can analyze this function for ( t > 0 ) (since ( T ) must be positive for the ratio to be meaningful, as ( S^2 ) is always non-negative).Let me set ( f(t) = frac{(1 + t)^2}{t} ). To find its minimum, take derivative:( f'(t) = frac{2(1 + t) cdot t - (1 + t)^2}{t^2} = frac{2t(1 + t) - (1 + t)^2}{t^2} = frac{(1 + t)(2t - (1 + t))}{t^2} = frac{(1 + t)(t - 1)}{t^2} ).Set derivative equal to zero:( (1 + t)(t - 1) = 0 )Solutions: ( t = -1 ) or ( t = 1 ). Since ( t > 0 ), we consider ( t = 1 ).At ( t = 1 ), ( f(1) = frac{(1 + 1)^2}{1} = 4 ).So, the minimal value of ( f(t) ) for ( t > 0 ) is 4, achieved at ( t = 1 ).Wait, but that's the same as the earlier case where ( x_1 = x_2 = 1 ). So, in this case, the ratio is 4, which is higher than 3.So, in this case, the minimal ratio is 3, achieved when all variables are equal or when variables are in the pattern ( a, b, a, b, a, b ).Therefore, the minimal value of ( frac{S^2}{T} ) is 3, so the largest ( C ) is 3.Therefore, the inequality holds with ( C = 3 ).Now, to find all ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_6 ) for which equality holds.Equality occurs when ( mathbf{x} ) is such that ( mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x} = 3 A mathbf{x} ).From the earlier Lagrangian conditions, we have:( 2 S = lambda (x_{i-2} + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2}) )But for equality, the vector ( mathbf{x} ) must be such that ( mathbf{1} mathbf{1}^T mathbf{x} = 3 A mathbf{x} ).Alternatively, from the ratio ( frac{S^2}{T} = 3 ), which occurs when ( S^2 = 3 T ).From the earlier test cases, this occurs when all variables are equal, or when variables alternate between two values, like ( a, b, a, b, a, b ).So, let's check the case where ( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = a ) and ( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = b ).As computed earlier, ( S = 3(a + b) ), ( T = 3(a + b)^2 ).So, ( S^2 = 9(a + b)^2 = 3 times 3(a + b)^2 = 3 T ).Therefore, equality holds in this case.Similarly, when all variables are equal, ( x_i = a ), then ( S = 6a ), ( T = 12a^2 ), so ( S^2 = 36a^2 = 3 times 12a^2 = 3 T ). So, equality holds.Are there other cases where equality holds?Suppose ( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = x_5 = x_6 = a ). Then, as above, equality holds.Alternatively, suppose ( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = a ) and ( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = b ). Then, equality holds.Are there other solutions? For example, suppose ( x_1 = x_4 ), ( x_2 = x_5 ), ( x_3 = x_6 ). Let me test this.Let ( x_1 = x_4 = a ), ( x_2 = x_5 = b ), ( x_3 = x_6 = c ).Compute ( S = a + b + c + a + b + c = 2(a + b + c) ).Compute ( T ):Each term:( x_1(x_2 + x_3) = a(b + c) )( x_2(x_3 + x_4) = b(c + a) )( x_3(x_4 + x_5) = c(a + b) )( x_4(x_5 + x_6) = a(b + c) )( x_5(x_6 + x_1) = b(c + a) )( x_6(x_1 + x_2) = c(a + b) )So, ( T = 2[a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b)] = 2[ab + ac + bc + ba + ca + cb] = 2[2ab + 2ac + 2bc] = 4(ab + ac + bc) ).Then, ( S^2 = [2(a + b + c)]^2 = 4(a + b + c)^2 ).So, the ratio ( frac{S^2}{T} = frac{4(a + b + c)^2}{4(ab + ac + bc)} = frac{(a + b + c)^2}{ab + ac + bc} ).We need this ratio to be equal to 3.So,[frac{(a + b + c)^2}{ab + ac + bc} = 3]Which implies:[(a + b + c)^2 = 3(ab + ac + bc)]Expanding the left side:[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 3ab + 3ac + 3bc]Simplify:[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = 0]Which can be written as:[frac{1}{2}[(a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2] = 0]Therefore, each squared term must be zero, so ( a = b = c ).Therefore, in this case, equality holds only when ( a = b = c ), which reduces to the case where all variables are equal.Therefore, the only solutions where equality holds are when all variables are equal, or when variables alternate between two values ( a ) and ( b ) such that the sum ( a + b ) is consistent.Wait, but in the alternating case, when ( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = a ) and ( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = b ), we saw that equality holds regardless of ( a ) and ( b ), as long as they are constants. So, in that case, ( a ) and ( b ) can be any real numbers, not necessarily equal.Wait, but earlier, when I set ( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = a ) and ( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = b ), the ratio was always 3, regardless of ( a ) and ( b ). So, in that case, equality holds for any ( a ) and ( b ).But when I considered the case where ( x_1 = x_4 ), ( x_2 = x_5 ), ( x_3 = x_6 ), equality only holds when ( a = b = c ). So, that's a different case.Therefore, the equality holds in two cases:1. All variables are equal: ( x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_6 = a ).2. Variables alternate between two values: ( x_1 = x_3 = x_5 = a ) and ( x_2 = x_4 = x_6 = b ), for any real numbers ( a ) and ( b ).Therefore, these are the cases where equality holds.To confirm, let me test another case where variables alternate between ( a ) and ( b ).Let ( x_1 = a ), ( x_2 = b ), ( x_3 = a ), ( x_4 = b ), ( x_5 = a ), ( x_6 = b ).Compute ( S = a + b + a + b + a + b = 3(a + b) ).Compute ( T ):Each term:( x_1(x_2 + x_3) = a(b + a) )( x_2(x_3 + x_4) = b(a + b) )( x_3(x_4 + x_5) = a(b + a) )( x_4(x_5 + x_6) = b(a + b) )( x_5(x_6 + x_1) = a(b + a) )( x_6(x_1 + x_2) = b(a + b) )So, ( T = 3a(a + b) + 3b(a + b) = 3(a + b)^2 ).Thus, ( S^2 = 9(a + b)^2 = 3 times 3(a + b)^2 = 3 T ). So, equality holds.Therefore, the cases where equality holds are when all variables are equal, or when variables alternate between two values.Hence, the largest constant ( C ) is 3, and equality holds when all variables are equal or when they alternate between two values.**Final Answer**The largest constant is (boxed{3})."},{"question":"There are three types of items, priced at 2 yuan, 4 yuan, and 6 yuan respectively. Now, with 60 yuan, you buy a total of 16 items of these three types, and the money is exactly used up. The maximum number of items that can be bought for 6 yuan is     .","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the maximum number of 6-yuan items I can buy with 60 yuan, given that I also have to buy a total of 16 items, including 2-yuan and 4-yuan items. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let me note down the given information:- There are three types of items: priced at 2 yuan, 4 yuan, and 6 yuan.- Total money available: 60 yuan.- Total number of items to buy: 16.- We need to maximize the number of 6-yuan items.So, let me assign variables to each type of item to make it easier:Let’s say:- Let x be the number of 2-yuan items.- Let y be the number of 4-yuan items.- Let z be the number of 6-yuan items.So, according to the problem, we have two main equations:1. The total number of items: x + y + z = 162. The total cost: 2x + 4y + 6z = 60Our goal is to find the maximum possible value of z.Alright, so now I have two equations and three variables. That means I need to find integer solutions for x, y, z that satisfy both equations, and then among those solutions, find the one with the highest z.Let me try to express x and y in terms of z to reduce the number of variables.From the first equation: x + y = 16 - zFrom the second equation: 2x + 4y = 60 - 6zHmm, okay, so I can write the second equation as:2x + 4y = 60 - 6zI can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 2:x + 2y = 30 - 3zSo now I have:1. x + y = 16 - z2. x + 2y = 30 - 3zLet me subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate x:(x + 2y) - (x + y) = (30 - 3z) - (16 - z)Simplify:x + 2y - x - y = 30 - 3z - 16 + zWhich simplifies to:y = 14 - 2zOkay, so y is equal to 14 minus twice z. That's helpful.Now, going back to the first equation:x + y = 16 - zWe can substitute y with (14 - 2z):x + (14 - 2z) = 16 - zSimplify:x + 14 - 2z = 16 - zSubtract 14 from both sides:x - 2z = 2 - zAdd 2z to both sides:x = 2 + zSo, x is equal to 2 plus z.Alright, so now we have expressions for both x and y in terms of z:x = z + 2y = 14 - 2zNow, since x, y, and z are all numbers of items, they must be non-negative integers. So, we can write the constraints:1. x ≥ 0 ⇒ z + 2 ≥ 0 ⇒ z ≥ -2 (But since z is a count, z ≥ 0)2. y ≥ 0 ⇒ 14 - 2z ≥ 0 ⇒ 14 ≥ 2z ⇒ z ≤ 73. z must be an integer.So, z can be at most 7.But wait, let me check if z can actually be 7. Let's plug z = 7 into the equations for x and y:x = 7 + 2 = 9y = 14 - 2*7 = 14 - 14 = 0So, x = 9, y = 0, z = 7.Let me verify if this satisfies the total cost:2x + 4y + 6z = 2*9 + 4*0 + 6*7 = 18 + 0 + 42 = 60Yes, that adds up to 60 yuan. And the total number of items is 9 + 0 + 7 = 16. Perfect.So, z can be 7. But wait, let me check if z can be higher than 7. If z = 8, then y would be 14 - 2*8 = 14 - 16 = -2, which is negative. That's not possible because we can't have a negative number of items. So, z cannot be 8.Therefore, the maximum possible z is 7.But just to be thorough, let me check z = 7, 6, 5, etc., to see if it's possible.Wait, z = 7 works as above.What about z = 6?x = 6 + 2 = 8y = 14 - 12 = 2Total cost: 2*8 + 4*2 + 6*6 = 16 + 8 + 36 = 60Total items: 8 + 2 + 6 = 16That works too, but z is 6, which is less than 7.Similarly, z = 5:x = 5 + 2 = 7y = 14 - 10 = 4Total cost: 2*7 + 4*4 + 6*5 = 14 + 16 + 30 = 60Total items: 7 + 4 + 5 = 16Also works, but z is 5.So, as z decreases, x decreases by 1 and y increases by 2 each time.But since we are looking for the maximum z, z=7 is the highest possible.Wait, but just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.Another method could be to express everything in terms of z and see the constraints.We have:Total cost: 2x + 4y + 6z = 60Total items: x + y + z = 16We can express x as 16 - y - z, then plug into the cost equation:2*(16 - y - z) + 4y + 6z = 60Simplify:32 - 2y - 2z + 4y + 6z = 60Combine like terms:32 + 2y + 4z = 60Subtract 32 from both sides:2y + 4z = 28Divide both sides by 2:y + 2z = 14So, y = 14 - 2zWhich is the same as before.So, same result.Therefore, y = 14 - 2z, and since y must be non-negative, z ≤ 7.Thus, the maximum z is 7.Therefore, the answer is 7.But just to double-check, let me try plugging z =7 into the original equations.x + y + z = 16 ⇒ x + y = 92x + 4y + 6z = 60 ⇒ 2x + 4y = 60 - 42 = 18So, 2x + 4y = 18Divide by 2: x + 2y = 9But from x + y = 9, subtracting gives y = 0, which is consistent with our earlier result.So, x =9, y=0, z=7.Yes, that works.Alternatively, if I think about it, buying as many 6-yuan items as possible would leave less money for the cheaper items, but since we have a fixed number of items, we have to balance between the number and the cost.But in this case, since 6 is the most expensive, buying more of them would require fewer of the cheaper ones, but since the total number is fixed, we have to see how much we can push z.But in our equations, we found that z can be up to 7, which is possible because y becomes 0, but x becomes 9, which is still a valid number.So, yeah, 7 is the maximum.I think that's solid.**Final Answer**The maximum number of items that can be bought for 6 yuan is boxed{7}."},{"question":"Given a sequence {a_n} that satisfies: a_1=1, a_{n+1}=2a_n (nin mathbb{N}^*), find the value of a_5 and the sum of the first 8 terms, S_8.","answer":"Alright, so I have this sequence problem here. It says that the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_1 = 1, and each subsequent term is twice the previous one, meaning a_{n+1} = 2a_n for any natural number n. I need to find the value of a_5 and the sum of the first 8 terms, which is S_8.Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand what kind of sequence this is. The first term is 1, and each term is double the one before it. So, starting from a_1, each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term. That sounds like a geometric sequence, right?In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, which in this case is 2. So, the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a_1 * r^{n-1}, where r is the common ratio.Given that a_1 is 1 and r is 2, the formula for this sequence should be a_n = 1 * 2^{n-1}, which simplifies to a_n = 2^{n-1}. Let me verify that with the given recurrence relation.Starting with a_1 = 1, then a_2 should be 2a_1 = 2*1 = 2. Using the formula, a_2 = 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2. That matches. Similarly, a_3 should be 2a_2 = 2*2 = 4. Using the formula, a_3 = 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4. Perfect, that works too.So, I can confidently say that the nth term is a_n = 2^{n-1}. Now, the problem asks for a_5. Let me compute that.a_5 = 2^{5-1} = 2^4. 2^4 is 16. So, a_5 is 16.Wait, let me double-check by computing each term step by step:a_1 = 1a_2 = 2a_1 = 2*1 = 2a_3 = 2a_2 = 2*2 = 4a_4 = 2a_3 = 2*4 = 8a_5 = 2a_4 = 2*8 = 16Yep, that's correct. So, a_5 is indeed 16.Now, moving on to the sum of the first 8 terms, S_8. Since this is a geometric series, the sum of the first n terms can be calculated using the formula S_n = a_1*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Let me recall that formula correctly.Yes, for a geometric series, the sum S_n is equal to the first term times (r to the power of n minus 1) divided by (r minus 1). So, plugging in the values we have:a_1 = 1, r = 2, n = 8.So, S_8 = 1*(2^8 - 1)/(2 - 1). Let's compute that.First, compute 2^8. 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, 2^7 is 128, and 2^8 is 256. So, 2^8 is 256.Then, 2^8 - 1 is 256 - 1 = 255.The denominator is 2 - 1 = 1.So, S_8 = 1*(255)/1 = 255.Let me verify this by adding up the first 8 terms manually:a_1 = 1a_2 = 2a_3 = 4a_4 = 8a_5 = 16a_6 = 32a_7 = 64a_8 = 128Adding them up: 1 + 2 = 3; 3 + 4 = 7; 7 + 8 = 15; 15 + 16 = 31; 31 + 32 = 63; 63 + 64 = 127; 127 + 128 = 255.Wow, that's the same result. So, S_8 is indeed 255.Just to recap, since this is a geometric sequence with ratio 2, each term is double the previous one, leading to exponential growth. The nth term is 2^{n-1}, so the fifth term is 16, and the sum of the first eight terms is 255.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the formula and the manual addition give the same result for S_8. So, I feel confident about these answers.**Final Answer**The value of (a_5) is boxed{16} and the sum of the first 8 terms, (S_8), is boxed{255}."},{"question":"What is the exact value of the product sin 10^{circ} sin 30^{circ} sin 50^{circ} sin 70^{circ}?","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the exact value of the product sin10° sin30° sin50° sin70°. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about some trigonometric identities that might help here.First, I remember that sin30° is a known value. Let me write that down: sin30° = 1/2. So, if I can compute the product of the other three sines and then multiply by 1/2, that might simplify things.So, the product becomes (1/2) * sin10° sin50° sin70°. Now, I need to figure out sin10° sin50° sin70°. I wonder if there's a way to pair these terms or use some product-to-sum identities. I recall that the product of sines can sometimes be expressed as a sum, which might make it easier to compute.Let me write down the product-to-sum formula for two sines: sinA sinB = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2. Maybe I can apply this to two of the sines first and then see what happens.Let's take sin10° sin50° first. Applying the formula, we get:sin10° sin50° = [cos(10° - 50°) - cos(10° + 50°)] / 2= [cos(-40°) - cos60°] / 2= [cos40° - cos60°] / 2Since cosine is an even function, cos(-40°) is equal to cos40°. Also, cos60° is 1/2. So, substituting that in:= [cos40° - 1/2] / 2= (cos40°)/2 - 1/4Okay, so sin10° sin50° simplifies to (cos40°)/2 - 1/4. Now, I need to multiply this by sin70°. So, the product becomes:[(cos40°)/2 - 1/4] * sin70°Let me distribute sin70°:= (cos40° / 2) * sin70° - (1/4) * sin70°Hmm, now I have two terms. Let me handle each term separately. Maybe I can use the product-to-sum identity again for each term.Starting with the first term: (cos40° / 2) * sin70°. Let me factor out the 1/2:= (1/2) * cos40° sin70°Again, using the product-to-sum identity, but this time for cosA sinB. I think the identity is:cosA sinB = [sin(A + B) + sin(B - A)] / 2So, applying that:cos40° sin70° = [sin(40° + 70°) + sin(70° - 40°)] / 2= [sin110° + sin30°] / 2We know that sin30° is 1/2, and sin110° is sin(180° - 70°) = sin70°, which is approximately 0.9397, but I need the exact value. Wait, maybe I can express sin110° in terms of another angle? Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me just write it as sin110° for now.So, substituting back:= (1/2) * [sin110° + sin30°] / 2= (1/2) * [sin110° + 1/2] / 2= [sin110° + 1/2] / 4Okay, so the first term simplifies to [sin110° + 1/2] / 4.Now, moving on to the second term: - (1/4) * sin70°. That's straightforward; it's just - sin70° / 4.So, putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:[sin110° + 1/2] / 4 - sin70° / 4Combine the terms over a common denominator:= [sin110° + 1/2 - sin70°] / 4Hmm, let's see if we can simplify sin110° - sin70°. I remember there's a sine subtraction formula: sinA - sinB = 2 cos[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2]. Let me apply that.So, sin110° - sin70° = 2 cos[(110° + 70°)/2] sin[(110° - 70°)/2]= 2 cos[180°/2] sin[40°/2]= 2 cos90° sin20°But cos90° is 0, so this simplifies to 0. Wait, that can't be right because sin110° is not equal to sin70°. Let me double-check the formula.Wait, no, actually, sin110° - sin70° = 2 cos[(110 + 70)/2] sin[(110 - 70)/2] = 2 cos90° sin20°. Since cos90° is 0, this term becomes 0. So, sin110° - sin70° = 0.Wait, that doesn't make sense because sin110° is sin(180° - 70°) = sin70°, so sin110° = sin70°, so sin110° - sin70° = 0. Oh, right! So, that term cancels out.So, going back to our expression:= [0 + 1/2] / 4= (1/2) / 4= 1/8Wait, so putting it all together, the product sin10° sin30° sin50° sin70° simplifies to 1/8? Let me verify that because that seems a bit too straightforward.Wait, let me recap:We started with sin10° sin30° sin50° sin70°.We know sin30° = 1/2, so we have (1/2) * sin10° sin50° sin70°.Then, we expressed sin10° sin50° as [cos40° - 1/2]/2.Then, multiplied by sin70°, leading to two terms: [cos40° sin70°]/2 - sin70°/4.Then, we expressed cos40° sin70° as [sin110° + sin30°]/2, which gave us [sin110° + 1/2]/4.Subtracting sin70°/4, we had [sin110° + 1/2 - sin70°]/4.But since sin110° = sin70°, the sin110° - sin70° cancels out, leaving [1/2]/4 = 1/8.So, that seems correct. Therefore, the exact value is 1/8.Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute the numerical value to check.Compute sin10° ≈ 0.1736, sin30° = 0.5, sin50° ≈ 0.7660, sin70° ≈ 0.9397.Multiplying them together: 0.1736 * 0.5 = 0.0868; 0.0868 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.0665; 0.0665 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.0625.And 1/8 is 0.125, wait, that's not matching. Wait, 0.0625 is 1/16, not 1/8. Hmm, that's a problem. So, my earlier conclusion must be wrong.Wait, so something's wrong here. Let me check my steps again.Starting from the beginning:sin10° sin30° sin50° sin70°.sin30° = 1/2, so it's (1/2) * sin10° sin50° sin70°.Then, sin10° sin50° = [cos40° - cos60°]/2 = [cos40° - 1/2]/2.So, [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70°.Which is [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, hold on. Wait, [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° is equal to [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, actually, it's [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me clarify:[cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° = [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me do it step by step.Let me denote A = [cos40° - 1/2]/2.Then, A * sin70° = [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° = [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, that's not correct. Because [cos40° - 1/2]/2 multiplied by sin70° is equal to [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, actually, that is correct. Because you distribute the multiplication over the subtraction.So, [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° = [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.So, that's correct.Then, we have:= [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2= [cos40° sin70°]/2 - [ (1/2) sin70° ] / 2= [cos40° sin70°]/2 - sin70° / 4So, that's correct.Then, we expressed cos40° sin70° as [sin110° + sin30°]/2.So, substituting back:= [ [sin110° + sin30°]/2 ] / 2 - sin70° / 4= [sin110° + sin30°]/4 - sin70° / 4= [sin110° + sin30° - sin70°] / 4But sin110° = sin70°, so sin110° - sin70° = 0.Therefore, we have [0 + sin30°] / 4 = sin30° / 4 = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.But when I numerically compute the product, I get approximately 0.0625, which is 1/16, not 1/8. So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, let me compute the numerical value again:sin10° ≈ 0.1736sin30° = 0.5sin50° ≈ 0.7660sin70° ≈ 0.9397Multiplying all together:0.1736 * 0.5 = 0.08680.0868 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.06650.0665 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.0625Which is 1/16, not 1/8. So, that suggests that my earlier conclusion of 1/8 is wrong.Wait, so where did I go wrong?Let me go back step by step.Starting with sin10° sin30° sin50° sin70°.I wrote sin30° = 1/2, so the product is (1/2) * sin10° sin50° sin70°.Then, I expressed sin10° sin50° as [cos40° - cos60°]/2, which is correct because sinA sinB = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.So, sin10° sin50° = [cos40° - cos60°]/2 = [cos40° - 1/2]/2.So, that's correct.Then, I multiplied this by sin70°, so:[cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° = [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° is equal to [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, actually, that is correct. Because you distribute the multiplication over the subtraction.So, [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° = [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.So, that's correct.Then, we have:= [cos40° sin70°]/2 - [ (1/2) sin70° ] / 2= [cos40° sin70°]/2 - sin70° / 4So, that's correct.Then, we expressed cos40° sin70° as [sin110° + sin30°]/2.So, substituting back:= [ [sin110° + sin30°]/2 ] / 2 - sin70° / 4= [sin110° + sin30°]/4 - sin70° / 4= [sin110° + sin30° - sin70°] / 4But sin110° = sin70°, so sin110° - sin70° = 0.Therefore, we have [0 + sin30°] / 4 = sin30° / 4 = (1/2)/4 = 1/8.But the numerical calculation gives 1/16. So, clearly, there's a mistake in the process.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the product-to-sum identity? Let me double-check.The identity is sinA sinB = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2. That's correct.Similarly, cosA sinB = [sin(A + B) + sin(B - A)] / 2. That's also correct.So, when I did cos40° sin70°, I used the identity correctly:cos40° sin70° = [sin(40 + 70) + sin(70 - 40)] / 2 = [sin110° + sin30°]/2. That's correct.So, that part is fine.Wait, but when I substituted back, I had:[ [sin110° + sin30°]/2 ] / 2 - sin70° / 4Which is [sin110° + sin30°]/4 - sin70° / 4.But sin110° is sin70°, so [sin70° + sin30° - sin70°]/4 = sin30° / 4 = 1/8.But the numerical calculation suggests it's 1/16. So, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.Wait, let me go back to the step where I had:sin10° sin50° sin70° = [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70°.Wait, that's correct.Then, [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° = [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° is equal to [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2.Wait, no, actually, that is correct. Because:[cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70° = (cos40° sin70°)/2 - (1/2 sin70°)/2 = (cos40° sin70°)/2 - sin70°/4.So, that's correct.Then, cos40° sin70° = [sin110° + sin30°]/2.So, substituting:= [ [sin110° + sin30°]/2 ] / 2 - sin70° / 4= [sin110° + sin30°]/4 - sin70° / 4= [sin110° + sin30° - sin70°]/4But sin110° = sin70°, so sin110° - sin70° = 0.Thus, [0 + sin30°]/4 = sin30° /4 = 1/8.But the numerical value is 1/16. So, that suggests that my process is wrong.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me try a different approach.I remember that for multiple sine products, sometimes using complex numbers or other identities can help. Alternatively, maybe pairing the terms differently.Let me try pairing sin10° sin70° and sin30° sin50°.So, sin10° sin70° and sin30° sin50°.Compute each pair separately.First, sin10° sin70°. Using the product-to-sum identity:sinA sinB = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.So, sin10° sin70° = [cos(10° - 70°) - cos(10° + 70°)] / 2= [cos(-60°) - cos80°] / 2= [cos60° - cos80°] / 2= [1/2 - cos80°] / 2= 1/4 - (cos80°)/2Similarly, sin30° sin50° = [cos(30° - 50°) - cos(30° + 50°)] / 2= [cos(-20°) - cos80°] / 2= [cos20° - cos80°] / 2So, now, the original product becomes:[sin10° sin70°] * [sin30° sin50°] = [1/4 - (cos80°)/2] * [cos20° - cos80°]/2Hmm, that seems complicated, but let's try to expand it.Let me denote A = 1/4 - (cos80°)/2 and B = [cos20° - cos80°]/2.So, the product is A * B.Expanding A * B:= (1/4)(cos20° - cos80°)/2 - (cos80°)/2 * (cos20° - cos80°)/2Simplify each term:First term: (1/4)(cos20° - cos80°)/2 = (cos20° - cos80°)/8Second term: - (cos80°)/2 * (cos20° - cos80°)/2 = - [cos80° cos20° - (cos80°)^2] / 4So, putting it all together:= (cos20° - cos80°)/8 - [cos80° cos20° - (cos80°)^2]/4Let me write this as:= (cos20° - cos80°)/8 - cos80° cos20° /4 + (cos80°)^2 /4Hmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe I can use more identities here.First, let's compute cos20° - cos80°. Using the identity cosA - cosB = -2 sin[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2].So, cos20° - cos80° = -2 sin[(20 + 80)/2] sin[(20 - 80)/2]= -2 sin50° sin(-30°)= -2 sin50° (-1/2)= sin50°So, cos20° - cos80° = sin50°.Therefore, the first term becomes sin50° /8.Now, the second term: - cos80° cos20° /4.We can use the product-to-sum identity again: cosA cosB = [cos(A + B) + cos(A - B)] / 2.So, cos80° cos20° = [cos100° + cos60°]/2.Therefore, - cos80° cos20° /4 = - [cos100° + cos60°]/8.Similarly, the third term: (cos80°)^2 /4.We can use the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.So, (cos80°)^2 = (1 + cos160°)/2.Thus, (cos80°)^2 /4 = (1 + cos160°)/8.Putting it all together:= sin50° /8 - [cos100° + cos60°]/8 + (1 + cos160°)/8Combine all terms over a common denominator of 8:= [sin50° - cos100° - cos60° + 1 + cos160°] /8Now, let's simplify each term:First, sin50° is just sin50°.Second, -cos100°. Cos100° is equal to -cos80°, since cos(180° - θ) = -cosθ.Third, -cos60° = -1/2.Fourth, +1.Fifth, +cos160°. Cos160° is equal to -cos20°, since cos(180° - θ) = -cosθ.So, substituting these:= [sin50° - (-cos80°) - 1/2 + 1 + (-cos20°)] /8= [sin50° + cos80° - 1/2 + 1 - cos20°] /8= [sin50° + cos80° + 1/2 - cos20°] /8Now, let's see if we can simplify sin50° + cos80° - cos20°.Note that cos80° = sin10°, since cosθ = sin(90° - θ). So, cos80° = sin10°.Similarly, cos20° = sin70°, since cosθ = sin(90° - θ). So, cos20° = sin70°.Therefore, sin50° + cos80° - cos20° = sin50° + sin10° - sin70°.Hmm, let's see if we can combine these sines.We can use the identity sinA + sinB = 2 sin[(A + B)/2] cos[(A - B)/2].So, sin50° + sin10° = 2 sin[(50 + 10)/2] cos[(50 - 10)/2]= 2 sin30° cos20°= 2*(1/2)*cos20°= cos20°So, sin50° + sin10° = cos20°.Therefore, sin50° + sin10° - sin70° = cos20° - sin70°.But sin70° = cos20°, since sinθ = cos(90° - θ). So, sin70° = cos20°.Thus, cos20° - sin70° = cos20° - cos20° = 0.Therefore, the numerator simplifies to 0 + 1/2 = 1/2.So, putting it all together:= [1/2] /8 = 1/16Ah! So, the exact value is 1/16, which matches the numerical calculation.Wait, so where did I go wrong earlier? It seems that in my first approach, I incorrectly concluded that sin110° - sin70° = 0, but in reality, when I paired the terms differently, I ended up with a different result.Wait, let me see. In the first approach, I had:[sin110° + sin30° - sin70°]/4But sin110° = sin70°, so sin110° - sin70° = 0, leaving sin30° /4 = 1/8.But in the second approach, I ended up with 1/16. So, clearly, one of the approaches is wrong.Wait, but the numerical calculation suggests 1/16, so the second approach must be correct. Therefore, the first approach must have an error.Looking back, in the first approach, I had:sin10° sin50° sin70° = [cos40° - 1/2]/2 * sin70°Then, [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2Then, expressed cos40° sin70° as [sin110° + sin30°]/2.So, substituting:= [ [sin110° + sin30°]/2 - (1/2) sin70° ] /2Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me clarify:Wait, [cos40° sin70° - (1/2) sin70°]/2 is equal to [cos40° sin70°]/2 - [ (1/2) sin70° ] /2= [cos40° sin70°]/2 - sin70° /4Then, cos40° sin70° = [sin110° + sin30°]/2So, substituting:= [ [sin110° + sin30°]/2 ] /2 - sin70° /4= [sin110° + sin30°]/4 - sin70° /4= [sin110° + sin30° - sin70°]/4But sin110° = sin70°, so sin110° - sin70° = 0, so we have [0 + sin30°]/4 = 1/8.But that contradicts the second approach which gives 1/16.Wait, but in the second approach, I paired the terms differently and ended up with 1/16.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach in the step where I expressed sin10° sin50° as [cos40° - cos60°]/2.Wait, let me verify that:sin10° sin50° = [cos(10 - 50) - cos(10 + 50)] /2 = [cos(-40) - cos60]/2 = [cos40 - 1/2]/2.Yes, that's correct.Then, multiplying by sin70°:[cos40 - 1/2]/2 * sin70° = [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2.Yes, that's correct.Then, cos40 sin70 = [sin110 + sin30]/2.Yes, that's correct.So, substituting:= [ [sin110 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2 is equal to [ [sin110 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2.Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify:cos40 sin70 = [sin110 + sin30]/2So, [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2 = [ [sin110 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2= [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/4But sin110 = sin70, so sin110 - sin70 = 0, leaving sin30 /4 = 1/8.But in the second approach, I got 1/16.This is confusing. Let me compute both approaches numerically.First approach:sin10 ≈ 0.1736, sin30 = 0.5, sin50 ≈ 0.7660, sin70 ≈ 0.9397Product ≈ 0.1736 * 0.5 * 0.7660 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.0625, which is 1/16.Second approach, first step:sin10 sin70 ≈ 0.1736 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.1632sin30 sin50 ≈ 0.5 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.3830Then, product ≈ 0.1632 * 0.3830 ≈ 0.0625, which is 1/16.So, both approaches should give the same result, but in the first approach, I ended up with 1/8, which is wrong.Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the first approach.Wait, in the first approach, I had:sin10 sin30 sin50 sin70 = (1/2) * sin10 sin50 sin70Then, sin10 sin50 = [cos40 - 1/2]/2Then, multiplied by sin70:[cos40 - 1/2]/2 * sin70 = [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2Then, cos40 sin70 = [sin110 + sin30]/2So, substituting:= [ [sin110 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2= [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/4But sin110 = sin70, so sin110 - sin70 = 0, leaving sin30 /4 = 1/8.But this contradicts the numerical result.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where I substituted cos40 sin70.Wait, cos40 sin70 = [sin110 + sin30]/2But sin110 = sin70, so [sin70 + sin30]/2.Therefore, [sin70 + sin30]/2.So, substituting back:= [ [sin70 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2= [ (sin70 + sin30)/2 - sin70/2 ] /2= [ (sin70 + sin30 - sin70)/2 ] /2= [ sin30 /2 ] /2= sin30 /4 = 1/8.But that's not matching the numerical value.Wait, but in reality, when I compute [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2, it's equal to [cos40 sin70]/2 - sin70 /4.But cos40 sin70 = [sin110 + sin30]/2, which is [sin70 + 1/2]/2.So, [sin70 + 1/2]/2 /2 - sin70 /4= [sin70 + 1/2]/4 - sin70 /4= [sin70 + 1/2 - sin70]/4= 1/8.But numerically, the product is 1/16.Therefore, my first approach is wrong, but I can't see where.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step when I paired sin10 sin50.Wait, let me compute [cos40 - 1/2]/2 * sin70 numerically.cos40 ≈ 0.7660, so [0.7660 - 0.5]/2 = [0.2660]/2 = 0.1330.Then, 0.1330 * sin70 ≈ 0.1330 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.125.Then, multiplying by sin30 (1/2): 0.125 * 0.5 = 0.0625, which is 1/16.Wait, but in my first approach, I had:[cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2 = [ [sin110 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2But [sin110 + sin30]/2 = [sin70 + 1/2]/2 ≈ [0.9397 + 0.5]/2 ≈ 1.4397/2 ≈ 0.71985Then, subtracting (1/2) sin70 ≈ 0.5 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.46985So, 0.71985 - 0.46985 ≈ 0.25Then, dividing by 2: 0.25 /2 ≈ 0.125Then, multiplying by sin30 (1/2): 0.125 * 0.5 = 0.0625, which is 1/16.Wait, so in my first approach, I had:[ [sin110 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2 = [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/4But sin110 = sin70, so [sin70 + sin30 - sin70]/4 = sin30 /4 = 1/8.But numerically, it's 1/16.So, clearly, my algebraic manipulation is wrong somewhere.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where I substituted cos40 sin70.Wait, cos40 sin70 = [sin110 + sin30]/2.But sin110 = sin70, so [sin70 + sin30]/2.Therefore, [sin70 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 = [sin70 + sin30 - sin70]/2 = sin30 /2.Then, dividing by 2: sin30 /4 = 1/8.But numerically, it's 1/16.Wait, but in reality, when I compute [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2, it's equal to [cos40 sin70]/2 - sin70 /4.But cos40 sin70 ≈ 0.7660 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.71985.Then, 0.71985 /2 ≈ 0.3599.Then, subtracting sin70 /4 ≈ 0.9397 /4 ≈ 0.2349.So, 0.3599 - 0.2349 ≈ 0.125.Then, multiplying by sin30 (1/2): 0.125 * 0.5 = 0.0625, which is 1/16.So, in reality, the expression [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2 is equal to 0.125, not 1/8.Therefore, my mistake was in the algebraic manipulation where I thought [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/4 = 1/8, but in reality, it's [sin70 + sin30 - sin70]/4 = sin30 /4 = 1/8, but that's not matching the numerical value.Wait, but in reality, [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/4 is equal to [sin70 + sin30 - sin70]/4 = sin30 /4 = 1/8, but the numerical calculation shows that the expression is 0.125, which is 1/8, but then multiplied by sin30 (1/2), giving 1/16.Wait, no, in the first approach, I had:sin10 sin30 sin50 sin70 = (1/2) * [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2Which is (1/2) * [ [sin110 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2= (1/2) * [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/4= [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/8But sin110 = sin70, so [sin70 + sin30 - sin70]/8 = sin30 /8 = 1/16.Ah! There we go. I see now. I had missed the multiplication by 1/2 from the sin30° term.In the first approach, I had:sin10 sin30 sin50 sin70 = (1/2) * [cos40 sin70 - (1/2) sin70]/2Which is (1/2) * [ [sin110 + sin30]/2 - (1/2) sin70 ] /2= (1/2) * [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/4= [sin110 + sin30 - sin70]/8Since sin110 = sin70, this becomes [sin70 + sin30 - sin70]/8 = sin30 /8 = (1/2)/8 = 1/16.Ah! So, I had forgotten to multiply by the initial 1/2 from sin30°, which was outside the brackets. Therefore, the correct result is 1/16.So, the exact value is 1/16.Therefore, the correct answer is 1/16."},{"question":"Five runners ran a relay race. If the first runner had run twice as fast, they would have spent 5 % less time. If the second runner had run twice as fast, they would have spent 10 % less time. If the third runner had run twice as fast, they would have spent 12 % less time. If the fourth runner had run twice as fast, they would have spent 15 % less time. By what percentage less time would they have spent if the fifth runner had run twice as fast?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about five runners in a relay race. Each runner has a certain time they take to run their part, and if each runner had run twice as fast, the total time would decrease by a certain percentage. The question is asking, if the fifth runner had run twice as fast, by what percentage less time would they have spent?Let me try to break this down. First, I need to understand what it means for a runner to run twice as fast. If someone runs twice as fast, their speed is doubled, which means the time they take would be halved, right? Because speed and time are inversely related when distance is constant. So, if a runner's speed doubles, the time they take to cover their segment would be half of the original time.So, for each runner, if they had run twice as fast, their individual time would be halved. The problem states that for each runner, this halving of their time leads to a certain percentage decrease in the total relay race time. For example, the first runner running twice as fast would result in 5% less total time. Similarly, the second runner would lead to 10% less, and so on.I think the key here is to figure out how each runner's time contributes to the total time. Let me denote the original times of the five runners as ( t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5 ). The total original time ( T ) is ( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 ).Now, if the first runner runs twice as fast, their time becomes ( frac{t_1}{2} ). The new total time ( T_1 ) would be ( frac{t_1}{2} + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 ). The problem says this results in 5% less time, so:( T_1 = T - 0.05T = 0.95T )Similarly, for the second runner, if they run twice as fast, their time becomes ( frac{t_2}{2} ), so the new total time ( T_2 ) is ( t_1 + frac{t_2}{2} + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 = 0.90T ).Wait, actually, the problem says 10% less time, so ( T_2 = 0.90T ). Similarly, for the third runner, it's 12% less, so ( T_3 = 0.88T ), and for the fourth runner, 15% less, so ( T_4 = 0.85T ).So, for each runner, when their time is halved, the total time decreases by a certain percentage. I need to find the percentage decrease if the fifth runner runs twice as fast.Let me write down the equations for each case.For the first runner:( frac{t_1}{2} + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 = 0.95T )But the original total time is ( T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 ). So, substituting:( frac{t_1}{2} + (T - t_1) = 0.95T )Simplify:( frac{t_1}{2} + T - t_1 = 0.95T )Combine like terms:( T - frac{t_1}{2} = 0.95T )Subtract ( 0.95T ) from both sides:( T - 0.95T - frac{t_1}{2} = 0 )( 0.05T - frac{t_1}{2} = 0 )So,( frac{t_1}{2} = 0.05T )Multiply both sides by 2:( t_1 = 0.10T )So, the first runner's time is 10% of the total time.Similarly, let's do this for the second runner.When the second runner runs twice as fast, their time becomes ( frac{t_2}{2} ), so the new total time is:( t_1 + frac{t_2}{2} + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 = 0.90T )Again, original total time is ( T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 ). So,( frac{t_2}{2} + (T - t_2) = 0.90T )Simplify:( frac{t_2}{2} + T - t_2 = 0.90T )Combine like terms:( T - frac{t_2}{2} = 0.90T )Subtract ( 0.90T ) from both sides:( T - 0.90T - frac{t_2}{2} = 0 )( 0.10T - frac{t_2}{2} = 0 )So,( frac{t_2}{2} = 0.10T )Multiply both sides by 2:( t_2 = 0.20T )So, the second runner's time is 20% of the total time.Moving on to the third runner.When the third runner runs twice as fast, their time becomes ( frac{t_3}{2} ), so the new total time is:( t_1 + t_2 + frac{t_3}{2} + t_4 + t_5 = 0.88T )Again, original total time is ( T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 ). So,( frac{t_3}{2} + (T - t_3) = 0.88T )Simplify:( frac{t_3}{2} + T - t_3 = 0.88T )Combine like terms:( T - frac{t_3}{2} = 0.88T )Subtract ( 0.88T ) from both sides:( T - 0.88T - frac{t_3}{2} = 0 )( 0.12T - frac{t_3}{2} = 0 )So,( frac{t_3}{2} = 0.12T )Multiply both sides by 2:( t_3 = 0.24T )So, the third runner's time is 24% of the total time.Next, the fourth runner.When the fourth runner runs twice as fast, their time becomes ( frac{t_4}{2} ), so the new total time is:( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + frac{t_4}{2} + t_5 = 0.85T )Again, original total time is ( T = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 ). So,( frac{t_4}{2} + (T - t_4) = 0.85T )Simplify:( frac{t_4}{2} + T - t_4 = 0.85T )Combine like terms:( T - frac{t_4}{2} = 0.85T )Subtract ( 0.85T ) from both sides:( T - 0.85T - frac{t_4}{2} = 0 )( 0.15T - frac{t_4}{2} = 0 )So,( frac{t_4}{2} = 0.15T )Multiply both sides by 2:( t_4 = 0.30T )So, the fourth runner's time is 30% of the total time.Now, let's summarize what we have so far:- ( t_1 = 0.10T )- ( t_2 = 0.20T )- ( t_3 = 0.24T )- ( t_4 = 0.30T )We need to find ( t_5 ). Since the total time is ( T ), we can write:( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5 = T )Substituting the known values:( 0.10T + 0.20T + 0.24T + 0.30T + t_5 = T )Adding up the percentages:0.10 + 0.20 + 0.24 + 0.30 = 0.84So,( 0.84T + t_5 = T )Subtract 0.84T from both sides:( t_5 = T - 0.84T = 0.16T )So, the fifth runner's time is 16% of the total time.Now, the question is, if the fifth runner had run twice as fast, by what percentage less time would they have spent?So, if the fifth runner runs twice as fast, their time becomes ( frac{t_5}{2} = frac{0.16T}{2} = 0.08T ).The new total time ( T_5 ) would be:( t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + frac{t_5}{2} = 0.10T + 0.20T + 0.24T + 0.30T + 0.08T )Adding these up:0.10 + 0.20 + 0.24 + 0.30 + 0.08 = 0.92So, ( T_5 = 0.92T )Therefore, the total time decreases from ( T ) to ( 0.92T ), which is a decrease of ( 1 - 0.92 = 0.08 ) or 8%.So, the total time would have been 8% less if the fifth runner had run twice as fast.Wait, let me double-check that.Original total time: ( T )After fifth runner runs twice as fast: ( T_5 = 0.92T )So, the decrease is ( T - 0.92T = 0.08T ), which is 8% of the original time.Yes, that seems correct.But just to make sure, let's go through the steps again.We found each runner's time as a percentage of the total time:- Runner 1: 10%- Runner 2: 20%- Runner 3: 24%- Runner 4: 30%- Runner 5: 16%Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 16 = 100%, which checks out.If Runner 5's time is 16%, then halving it would save 8% of the total time. So, the total time would decrease by 8%.Therefore, the answer should be 8%.**Final Answer**The total time would have been reduced by boxed{8%}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = x^{3} + 2, then f'(2) =  ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = x³ + 2, and I need to find f'(2). Hmm, alright, let's see. I remember that f'(x) is the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. So, I need to find the derivative first and then plug in x = 2 into that derivative.Alright, let's start by recalling how to find the derivative of a function. I think the power rule is what I need here. The power rule says that if you have a function like f(x) = xⁿ, then the derivative f'(x) is n*xⁿ⁻¹. Yeah, that sounds right. So, applying that to each term in my function.My function is f(x) = x³ + 2. So, it's two terms: x³ and 2. Let's take the derivative term by term.First term: x³. Using the power rule, the derivative should be 3*x². Because the exponent is 3, so we bring that down as a coefficient and subtract one from the exponent, making it 2. So, 3x².Second term: 2. Hmm, what's the derivative of a constant? I think it's zero. Because the slope of a constant function is flat, right? So, the derivative of 2 is 0.So, putting it all together, the derivative f'(x) is 3x² + 0, which simplifies to just 3x².Okay, so f'(x) = 3x². Now, I need to evaluate this derivative at x = 2. That means I substitute 2 into the derivative function wherever there's an x.So, f'(2) = 3*(2)². Let's compute that step by step. First, square 2: 2² is 4. Then, multiply that by 3: 3*4 is 12.So, f'(2) should be 12.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, f(x) = x³ + 2. The derivative is 3x², correct. Plugging in 2: 3*(2)^2 = 3*4 = 12. Yeah, that seems right.I don't think I made any errors here. The process was straightforward: apply the power rule to each term, remember that the derivative of a constant is zero, and then substitute the value. Everything checks out.Just to be thorough, maybe I can use another method to verify. Maybe using the limit definition of the derivative. The limit as h approaches 0 of [f(2 + h) - f(2)] / h.Let's compute that. f(2 + h) is (2 + h)³ + 2. Let's expand (2 + h)³. I remember that (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So, applying that:(2 + h)³ = 2³ + 3*(2)²*h + 3*(2)*h² + h³ = 8 + 12h + 6h² + h³.So, f(2 + h) = 8 + 12h + 6h² + h³ + 2 = 10 + 12h + 6h² + h³.f(2) is 2³ + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10.So, f(2 + h) - f(2) = (10 + 12h + 6h² + h³) - 10 = 12h + 6h² + h³.Then, [f(2 + h) - f(2)] / h = (12h + 6h² + h³) / h = 12 + 6h + h².Now, take the limit as h approaches 0 of that expression. As h approaches 0, 6h approaches 0, and h² approaches 0. So, the limit is 12 + 0 + 0 = 12.So, using the limit definition, I also get f'(2) = 12. That confirms my earlier result.Alright, so I feel confident that f'(2) is indeed 12. I used two different methods: the power rule and the limit definition, and both gave me the same answer. So, I think that's solid.I guess another way to think about it is graphically. The function f(x) = x³ + 2 is a cubic function shifted up by 2 units. Its derivative, f'(x) = 3x², represents the slope of the tangent line at any point x on the curve. So, at x = 2, the slope of the tangent line is 12. That makes sense because the cubic function is increasing at that point, and the slope is positive.If I were to sketch the graph, at x = 2, the function is going upwards, and the tangent line there would have a steepness corresponding to a slope of 12. That seems reasonable for a cubic function, which grows rapidly as x increases.Just to recap, the steps I took were:1. Identify the function: f(x) = x³ + 2.2. Recall the power rule for differentiation.3. Apply the power rule to each term of the function.4. Remember that the derivative of a constant is zero.5. Combine the results to get the derivative function f'(x) = 3x².6. Substitute x = 2 into f'(x) to get f'(2) = 12.7. Verify the result using the limit definition of the derivative.8. Confirm that the result makes sense both algebraically and graphically.I think that's a thorough process. It's always good to check your work, especially when first learning calculus, to make sure you haven't missed anything. In this case, both methods led me to the same answer, so I can be pretty sure it's correct.I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using implicit differentiation or logarithmic differentiation. But in this case, since the function is straightforward, those methods might be overcomplicating things. The power rule is the most direct and efficient method here.Another thought: if I had a more complex function, say with multiple terms or higher exponents, the process would be similar. Just apply the power rule term by term, remembering to handle constants appropriately. It's all about breaking down the function into manageable parts and differentiating each part separately.Also, understanding why the derivative is 3x² is important. It's not just a formula to memorize, but it's based on the concept of the instantaneous rate of change. Each term's derivative tells us how that part of the function contributes to the overall slope at any given point.So, in summary, f'(2) is 12 because the derivative of x³ is 3x², and plugging in 2 gives 3*(2)^2 = 12. This is consistent with both the power rule and the limit definition, and it aligns with the behavior of the cubic function.**Final Answer**The value of ( f'(2) ) is boxed{12}."},{"question":"Evaluate log_{sqrt{6}} (216sqrt{6}).","answer":"Okay, so I need to evaluate the logarithm base sqrt(6) of 216 times sqrt(6). That is, log_{sqrt(6)} (216√6). Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, especially when the base isn't a whole number. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that logarithms can be converted to different bases using the change of base formula. The formula is log_b a = (log_c a) / (log_c b), where c is any positive number. Maybe I can use that here. Alternatively, I can try to express both the base and the argument in terms of the same exponent, which might make it easier.Let me try to express everything in terms of 6, since the base is sqrt(6), which is 6^(1/2). So, sqrt(6) is 6^(1/2). Then, the argument is 216 times sqrt(6). Let me see if I can write 216 as a power of 6. Hmm, 6^3 is 216 because 6*6=36, 36*6=216. So, 216 is 6^3. Then, sqrt(6) is 6^(1/2). So, 216*sqrt(6) is 6^3 * 6^(1/2). When you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So, 6^(3 + 1/2) is 6^(7/2). So, the argument is 6^(7/2).So, now the logarithm becomes log_{sqrt(6)} (6^(7/2)). Since the base is sqrt(6) which is 6^(1/2), and the argument is 6^(7/2), I can use the logarithm power rule. Remember, log_b (a^c) = c * log_b a. But in this case, the base is also a power of 6, so maybe I can write it in terms of exponents.Alternatively, I can use the change of base formula. Let me try that. So, log_{sqrt(6)} (6^(7/2)) can be written as (log_6 (6^(7/2))) / (log_6 (sqrt(6))). Because the change of base formula allows me to write the logarithm in terms of base 6, which might simplify things.Calculating the numerator first: log_6 (6^(7/2)). Since log_b (b^x) = x, this simplifies directly to 7/2.Now, the denominator: log_6 (sqrt(6)). Again, sqrt(6) is 6^(1/2), so log_6 (6^(1/2)) is 1/2.So, putting it together, the logarithm is (7/2) divided by (1/2). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so (7/2) * (2/1) = 7.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the value of log_{sqrt(6)} (216√6) is 7. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I converted 216 to 6^3, which is correct because 6*6=36, 36*6=216. Then, sqrt(6) is 6^(1/2), so multiplying 6^3 and 6^(1/2) gives 6^(3 + 1/2) = 6^(7/2). That seems right.Then, I used the change of base formula, writing log_{sqrt(6)} (6^(7/2)) as (log_6 (6^(7/2))) / (log_6 (sqrt(6))). Calculating the numerator gives 7/2, and the denominator gives 1/2. Dividing 7/2 by 1/2 is indeed 7. So, that seems correct.Alternatively, I could have approached this without changing the base. Let me try that method to confirm.Let’s denote y = log_{sqrt(6)} (216√6). By definition of logarithm, this means that (sqrt(6))^y = 216√6.Expressing sqrt(6) as 6^(1/2), we have (6^(1/2))^y = 6^(y/2). So, 6^(y/2) = 216√6.But we already established that 216√6 is 6^(7/2). So, 6^(y/2) = 6^(7/2). Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, y/2 = 7/2, which implies y = 7. So, that confirms the result again.Hmm, so both methods give me the same answer, 7. That gives me more confidence that the solution is correct.Just to recap, the key steps were expressing both the base and the argument as powers of 6, which simplified the logarithm. Then, using either the change of base formula or the definition of logarithms, I was able to equate the exponents and solve for the result.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same answer. So, I can confidently say that log_{sqrt(6)} (216√6) is equal to 7.**Final Answer**The value of log_{sqrt{6}} (216sqrt{6}) is boxed{7}."},{"question":"If y=left(x-1right)^{2}+ax+sin (x+frac{π}{2}) is an even function, then a=______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If ( y = (x - 1)^2 + ax + sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) ) is an even function, then what is ( a )? Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that an even function satisfies the condition ( f(-x) = f(x) ) for all ( x ) in its domain. So, that means if I plug in ( -x ) into the function, it should give me the same result as plugging in ( x ). That seems like the key here.Alright, let's write down the function again:( y = (x - 1)^2 + ax + sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) )I need to find the value of ( a ) such that this function is even. So, let me compute ( f(-x) ) and set it equal to ( f(x) ), then solve for ( a ).First, let's compute ( f(-x) ):( f(-x) = (-x - 1)^2 + a(-x) + sinleft(-x + frac{pi}{2}right) )Let me simplify each term step by step.Starting with the first term: ( (-x - 1)^2 ). Let's expand that.( (-x - 1)^2 = (-x - 1)(-x - 1) )Multiply it out:First, multiply ( -x ) by ( -x ): ( (-x)(-x) = x^2 )Then, ( -x ) times ( -1 ): ( (-x)(-1) = x )Then, ( -1 ) times ( -x ): ( (-1)(-x) = x )Finally, ( -1 ) times ( -1 ): ( (-1)(-1) = 1 )So, adding all those together: ( x^2 + x + x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1 )Wait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. Alternatively, I can recognize that ( (-x - 1)^2 ) is the same as ( (x + 1)^2 ) because squaring a negative gives the same result as squaring the positive. So, ( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 ). Yeah, that's correct.So, the first term simplifies to ( x^2 + 2x + 1 ).Next term: ( a(-x) ) is straightforward, that's just ( -ax ).Third term: ( sinleft(-x + frac{pi}{2}right) ). Hmm, sine is an odd function, so ( sin(-theta) = -sin(theta) ). But here, the argument is ( -x + frac{pi}{2} ), which can be rewritten as ( frac{pi}{2} - x ). Maybe I can use a trigonometric identity here.I remember that ( sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright) = cos(x) ). Let me verify that: yes, because ( sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright) = cos(x) ). So, that simplifies the third term to ( cos(x) ).Putting it all together, ( f(-x) ) becomes:( f(-x) = (x^2 + 2x + 1) - ax + cos(x) )Simplify that:( f(-x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) )Now, let's write down the original function ( f(x) ):( f(x) = (x - 1)^2 + ax + sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) )Let me expand ( (x - 1)^2 ):( (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 )And the sine term: ( sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) ). Again, using a trigonometric identity, ( sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) = cos(x) ). Let me confirm that: yes, because shifting sine by ( frac{pi}{2} ) gives cosine. So, that term simplifies to ( cos(x) ).So, substituting back into ( f(x) ):( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 + ax + cos(x) )Simplify:( f(x) = x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) )Now, we have expressions for both ( f(x) ) and ( f(-x) ). Since the function is even, ( f(-x) = f(x) ). So, let's set them equal:( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) = x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) )Hmm, let's subtract ( x^2 + 1 + cos(x) ) from both sides to simplify:Left side: ( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) - x^2 - 1 - cos(x) = 2x - ax )Right side: ( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) - x^2 - 1 - cos(x) = (a - 2)x )So, we have:( 2x - ax = (a - 2)x )Let me write that as:( (2 - a)x = (a - 2)x )Hmm, so ( (2 - a)x = (a - 2)x ). Let's bring all terms to one side:( (2 - a)x - (a - 2)x = 0 )Factor out the x:( [ (2 - a) - (a - 2) ]x = 0 )Simplify inside the brackets:( 2 - a - a + 2 = (2 + 2) + (-a - a) = 4 - 2a )So, we have:( (4 - 2a)x = 0 )This equation must hold for all ( x ) in the domain of the function, which is all real numbers since it's a polynomial plus a sine function, which is defined everywhere.The only way that ( (4 - 2a)x = 0 ) for all ( x ) is if the coefficient of ( x ) is zero. So:( 4 - 2a = 0 )Solving for ( a ):( 4 = 2a )Divide both sides by 2:( a = 2 )Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from ( f(-x) = f(x) ), expanded both sides correctly. The first term in ( f(-x) ) was ( x^2 + 2x + 1 ), correct. The second term was ( -ax ), correct. The third term became ( cos(x) ), correct.Original ( f(x) ) expanded to ( x^2 - 2x + 1 + ax + cos(x) ), which simplifies to ( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) ), correct.Setting ( f(-x) = f(x) ):Left side: ( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) )Right side: ( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) )Subtracting right side from left side:( (x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x)) - (x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x)) = 0 )Simplify:( x^2 - x^2 + 2x - (a - 2)x + 1 - 1 + cos(x) - cos(x) - ax = 0 )Wait, hold on, that seems a bit different. Let me do it term by term:- ( x^2 - x^2 = 0 )- ( 2x - (a - 2)x = 2x - a x + 2x = (4 - a)x )- ( 1 - 1 = 0 )- ( cos(x) - cos(x) = 0 )- And then the remaining term is ( -ax ). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the left side, it's ( -ax ), and in the right side, it's ( (a - 2)x ). So, when subtracting, it's ( -ax - (a - 2)x = -ax - a x + 2x = (-2a + 2)x ). Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.Wait, maybe I should do it step by step.Let me write it again:Left side: ( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) )Right side: ( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) )Subtract right side from left side:( (x^2 - x^2) + (2x - (a - 2)x) + (1 - 1) + (cos(x) - cos(x)) + (-ax) = 0 )Wait, actually, no. Wait, the left side is ( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) ), and the right side is ( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) ). So, subtracting right side from left side:( (x^2 - x^2) + (2x - (a - 2)x) + (1 - 1) + (cos(x) - cos(x)) + (-ax - 0) = 0 )Wait, that seems off. Wait, actually, in the left side, the term is ( -ax ), and in the right side, the linear term is ( (a - 2)x ). So, when subtracting, it's ( -ax - (a - 2)x ).So, let's compute:( -ax - (a - 2)x = -ax - a x + 2x = (-2a + 2)x )So, putting it all together:( 0 + (-2a + 2)x + 0 + 0 = 0 )So, ( (-2a + 2)x = 0 )Which simplifies to:( (-2a + 2)x = 0 )Since this must hold for all ( x ), the coefficient must be zero:( -2a + 2 = 0 )Solving for ( a ):( -2a = -2 )Divide both sides by -2:( a = 1 )Wait, hold on! Earlier I got ( a = 2 ), but now I'm getting ( a = 1 ). That means I must have made a mistake somewhere.Let me go back to the step where I set ( f(-x) = f(x) ):( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) = x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) )Subtract ( x^2 + 1 + cos(x) ) from both sides:Left side: ( 2x - ax )Right side: ( (a - 2)x )So, ( 2x - ax = (a - 2)x )Bring all terms to the left:( 2x - ax - (a - 2)x = 0 )Factor out x:( [2 - a - (a - 2)]x = 0 )Simplify inside the brackets:( 2 - a - a + 2 = (2 + 2) + (-a - a) = 4 - 2a )So, ( (4 - 2a)x = 0 )Therefore, ( 4 - 2a = 0 ) => ( a = 2 )Wait, so earlier, when I subtracted right side from left side, I think I messed up the signs.Wait, let me clarify:When I set ( f(-x) = f(x) ), it's:( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) = x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) )Subtract ( x^2 + 1 + cos(x) ) from both sides:Left side: ( 2x - ax )Right side: ( (a - 2)x )So, bringing everything to the left:( 2x - ax - (a - 2)x = 0 )Which is:( 2x - ax - a x + 2x = 0 )Combine like terms:( (2x + 2x) + (-ax - a x) = 4x - 2a x = 0 )Factor out x:( (4 - 2a)x = 0 )So, ( 4 - 2a = 0 ) => ( a = 2 )So, that's consistent. So, why did I get confused earlier? Because when I subtracted right side from left side, I think I incorrectly included the ( -ax ) term. Let me try that again.Left side: ( x^2 + 2x + 1 - ax + cos(x) )Right side: ( x^2 + (a - 2)x + 1 + cos(x) )Subtract right side from left side:( (x^2 - x^2) + (2x - (a - 2)x) + (1 - 1) + (cos(x) - cos(x)) + (-ax - 0) = 0 )Wait, that's not correct because the left side has ( -ax ) and the right side has ( (a - 2)x ). So, when subtracting, it's ( -ax - (a - 2)x ), which is ( -ax - a x + 2x = (-2a + 2)x ). But that's only part of the equation.Wait, actually, in the left side, the linear terms are ( 2x - ax ), and in the right side, it's ( (a - 2)x ). So, when subtracting right side from left side, it's ( (2x - ax) - (a - 2)x ).So, let's compute that:( 2x - ax - a x + 2x = (2x + 2x) + (-ax - a x) = 4x - 2a x )So, ( 4x - 2a x = 0 ), which gives ( (4 - 2a)x = 0 ), so ( 4 - 2a = 0 ), ( a = 2 ). So, that's consistent.Earlier, when I thought I got ( a = 1 ), I must have made a mistake in the subtraction step, perhaps incorrectly handling the signs.So, to summarize:We have ( f(-x) = f(x) ), which leads to ( 4 - 2a = 0 ), so ( a = 2 ).Let me verify this result by plugging ( a = 2 ) back into the original function and checking if it's even.Original function with ( a = 2 ):( y = (x - 1)^2 + 2x + sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) )Simplify:( (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 )( sinleft(x + frac{pi}{2}right) = cos(x) )So, ( y = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 2x + cos(x) )Simplify:( x^2 + 0x + 1 + cos(x) )So, ( y = x^2 + 1 + cos(x) )Now, let's check if this is even. Compute ( f(-x) ):( f(-x) = (-x)^2 + 1 + cos(-x) )Simplify:( x^2 + 1 + cos(x) ) because ( cos(-x) = cos(x) )Which is equal to ( f(x) ). So, yes, it is even.Therefore, ( a = 2 ) is indeed the correct answer.I think my confusion earlier was due to a miscalculation when subtracting the terms, but upon careful re-examination, ( a = 2 ) is consistent.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Find the equation of the tangent line to the given curve at the point with abscissa ( x_{0} ).[ y = 3 left( sqrt[3]{x} - 2 sqrt{x} right), quad x_{0} = 1 ]","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the equation of the tangent line to the curve given by ( y = 3 left( sqrt[3]{x} - 2 sqrt{x} right) ) at the point where the abscissa (which is the x-coordinate) is ( x_0 = 1 ). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that the equation of a tangent line at a point ( x_0 ) is given by:[ y = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0) ]So, I need to find two things: the value of the function at ( x_0 ) and the derivative of the function evaluated at ( x_0 ).Let me start by finding ( f(x_0) ), which is ( f(1) ). Plugging ( x = 1 ) into the function:[ f(1) = 3 left( sqrt[3]{1} - 2 sqrt{1} right) ]Calculating the cube root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 1 is also 1. So this simplifies to:[ f(1) = 3 left( 1 - 2 times 1 right) = 3(1 - 2) = 3(-1) = -3 ]Okay, so the point where the tangent line touches the curve is ( (1, -3) ).Next, I need to find the derivative ( f'(x) ) to get the slope of the tangent line at ( x = 1 ).

Let me rewrite the radicals as exponents to make differentiation easier:[ f(x) = 3 left( x^{1/3} - 2x^{1/2} right) ]Now, I can apply the power rule for differentiation term by term.First, differentiate ( x^{1/3} ):The derivative of ( x^n ) is ( nx^{n-1} ), so:[ frac{d}{dx} x^{1/3} = frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} ]Then, differentiate ( -2x^{1/2} ):Again, using the power rule:[ frac{d}{dx} (-2x^{1/2}) = -2 times frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2} = -x^{-1/2} ]Putting it all together, the derivative of the inside function is:[ frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} - x^{-1/2} ]But remember, the entire function is multiplied by 3, so we have to multiply the derivative by 3 as well:[ f'(x) = 3 left( frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} - x^{-1/2} right) ]Simplifying this, the 3 and the 1/3 cancel out in the first term:[ f'(x) = x^{-2/3} - 3x^{-1/2} ]Alternatively, we can write this using radicals:[ f'(x) = frac{1}{x^{2/3}} - frac{3}{x^{1/2}} ]Or, more neatly:[ f'(x) = frac{1}{sqrt[3]{x^2}} - frac{3}{sqrt{x}} ]Now, I need to evaluate this derivative at ( x = 1 ):[ f'(1) = frac{1}{sqrt[3]{1^2}} - frac{3}{sqrt{1}} ]Calculating each term:- ( sqrt[3]{1^2} = 1 ), so the first term is ( 1/1 = 1 ).- ( sqrt{1} = 1 ), so the second term is ( 3/1 = 3 ).Therefore:[ f'(1) = 1 - 3 = -2 ]So, the slope of the tangent line at ( x = 1 ) is ( -2 ).Now, putting it all together into the tangent line equation:[ y = f(1) + f'(1)(x - 1) ]We already found ( f(1) = -3 ) and ( f'(1) = -2 ), so plugging these in:[ y = -3 + (-2)(x - 1) ]Simplify the equation:First, distribute the -2:[ y = -3 - 2x + 2 ]Combine like terms (-3 + 2):[ y = -2x - 1 ]So, the equation of the tangent line is ( y = -2x - 1 ).Let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the function:[ y = 3 left( sqrt[3]{x} - 2 sqrt{x} right) ]At ( x = 1 ), ( y = 3(1 - 2(1)) = 3(-1) = -3 ). That seems correct.Derivative steps:- ( d/dx [x^{1/3}] = (1/3)x^{-2/3} )- ( d/dx [x^{1/2}] = (1/2)x^{-1/2} )So, derivative of inside function is ( (1/3)x^{-2/3} - 2*(1/2)x^{-1/2} = (1/3)x^{-2/3} - x^{-1/2} )Multiply by 3: ( 3*(1/3)x^{-2/3} - 3x^{-1/2} = x^{-2/3} - 3x^{-1/2} ). That looks right.Evaluating at x=1:- ( 1^{-2/3} = 1 )- ( 3*1^{-1/2} = 3*1 = 3 )So, derivative is 1 - 3 = -2. Correct.Tangent line equation:Using point-slope form: ( y - y_0 = m(x - x_0) )Which is ( y - (-3) = -2(x - 1) )Simplify: ( y + 3 = -2x + 2 ) => ( y = -2x + 2 - 3 ) => ( y = -2x -1 ). Yep, that's correct.I think I did everything right. Maybe I can also check by plugging in x=1 into the tangent line equation to see if I get y=-3:[ y = -2(1) -1 = -2 -1 = -3 ]Yes, that matches. So, the tangent line passes through (1, -3) and has a slope of -2, which is consistent.Therefore, I'm confident that the equation of the tangent line is ( y = -2x -1 ).**Final Answer**The equation of the tangent line is boxed{y = -2x - 1}."},{"question":"Insert three numbers x, y, z between 1 and 4 to make these five numbers 1, x, y, z, 4 form a geometric sequence. Then, the product of these five numbers equals _.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to insert three numbers x, y, z between 1 and 4 to form a geometric sequence. The sequence will be 1, x, y, z, 4. Then, I need to find the product of these five numbers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, if the first term is 1, then the next term x would be 1 multiplied by the common ratio r, right? So, x = r. Then, the term after that, y, would be x multiplied by r, which is r^2. Similarly, z would be y multiplied by r, which is r^3. And the last term is 4, which should be z multiplied by r, so 4 = r^4.Wait, so if 4 = r^4, then r must be the fourth root of 4. Let me write that down:r = 4^(1/4)Hmm, 4 is 2 squared, so 4^(1/4) is (2^2)^(1/4) which simplifies to 2^(2/4) or 2^(1/2), which is the square root of 2. So, r = sqrt(2). Let me confirm that:sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, and if I raise that to the fourth power: (sqrt(2))^4 = (2^(1/2))^4 = 2^(2) = 4. Yep, that works.So, the common ratio r is sqrt(2). Now, let's find the terms x, y, z.x is the first term multiplied by r, so x = 1 * sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).y is x multiplied by r, so y = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.z is y multiplied by r, so z = 2 * sqrt(2) = 2sqrt(2).And the last term is 4, which is z multiplied by r: 2sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) = 2*(sqrt(2))^2 = 2*2 = 4. Perfect, that checks out.So, the five numbers are 1, sqrt(2), 2, 2sqrt(2), 4.Now, the problem asks for the product of these five numbers. Let me compute that.Product = 1 * sqrt(2) * 2 * 2sqrt(2) * 4.Let me multiply them step by step.First, 1 * sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).Then, sqrt(2) * 2 = 2sqrt(2).Next, 2sqrt(2) * 2sqrt(2) = (2*2)*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 4*2 = 8.Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that step again.Wait, actually, 2sqrt(2) * 2sqrt(2) is (2*2)*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 4*2 = 8. That part is correct. So, up to that point, we have 8.Then, 8 * 4 = 32.So, the product is 32.Wait, let me verify that another way. Maybe using exponents.Since it's a geometric sequence, the product of the terms can be calculated as (first term * last term)^(number of terms / 2). Wait, is that correct?Wait, actually, in an arithmetic sequence, the product isn't straightforward like that, but in a geometric sequence, the product of terms equidistant from the ends is equal. So, for a geometric sequence with n terms, the product is (a1 * an)^(n/2). Let me see.In this case, n = 5, so the product would be (1 * 4)^(5/2) = (4)^(5/2).Compute 4^(5/2): 4^(1/2) is 2, so 2^5 = 32. Yep, same result.So, that's a good check. So, the product is 32.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute it term by term again:1 * sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)sqrt(2) * 2 = 2sqrt(2)2sqrt(2) * 2sqrt(2) = (2*2)*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 4*2 = 88 * 4 = 32Yep, that's consistent.Alternatively, I can write all the terms as powers of sqrt(2):1 = (sqrt(2))^0sqrt(2) = (sqrt(2))^12 = (sqrt(2))^22sqrt(2) = (sqrt(2))^34 = (sqrt(2))^4So, the product is (sqrt(2))^0 * (sqrt(2))^1 * (sqrt(2))^2 * (sqrt(2))^3 * (sqrt(2))^4Which is (sqrt(2))^(0+1+2+3+4) = (sqrt(2))^10Compute (sqrt(2))^10: sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^10 = 2^(10/2) = 2^5 = 32.Perfect, that's another way to get 32.So, all methods confirm that the product is 32.Therefore, the answer is 32.**Final Answer**The product of these five numbers equals boxed{32}."},{"question":"Find all natural numbers  n  such that when we multiply all divisors of  n , we will obtain  10^9 .

A *divisor* of  n  is a natural number that divides  n  without any remainder. For example,  5  is a divisor of  30  because  30 div 5 = 6 ; but  5  is not a divisor of  47  because  47 div 5 = 9  with remainder  2 . In this problem, we consider only positive integer numbers  n  and positive integer divisors of  n . Thus, for example, if we multiply all divisors of  6  we will obtain  36 .)","answer":"Okay, so I need to find all natural numbers ( n ) such that when we multiply all the divisors of ( n ), the result is ( 10^9 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for any number ( n ), if it has divisors ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k ), then the product of all the divisors is ( n^{k/2} ). Is that right? Let me verify with an example. Take ( n = 6 ). Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. The product is ( 1 times 2 times 3 times 6 = 36 ). And ( 6^{4/2} = 6^2 = 36 ). Yeah, that works. So, the formula seems correct.So, if the product of all divisors of ( n ) is ( 10^9 ), then ( n^{k/2} = 10^9 ), where ( k ) is the number of divisors of ( n ). Therefore, ( n^{k} = (10^9)^2 = 10^{18} ).So, ( n^k = 10^{18} ). Now, ( 10^{18} ) is ( (2 times 5)^{18} = 2^{18} times 5^{18} ). So, ( n ) must be a product of powers of 2 and 5 only, right? Because if ( n ) had any other prime factor, then ( n^k ) would have that prime factor too, which isn't present in ( 10^{18} ).Therefore, ( n ) must be of the form ( 2^a times 5^b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are non-negative integers. Then, ( n^k = (2^a times 5^b)^k = 2^{a k} times 5^{b k} ). This must equal ( 2^{18} times 5^{18} ). Therefore, we have the equations:1. ( a k = 18 )2. ( b k = 18 )So, both ( a ) and ( b ) must be such that when multiplied by ( k ), the result is 18. That suggests that ( a = b ), since both are multiplied by ( k ) to get 18. So, ( a = b ). Let me denote ( a = b = c ). Then, ( c k = 18 ).So, ( c ) and ( k ) are positive integers such that ( c k = 18 ). So, the possible pairs ( (c, k) ) are the factor pairs of 18. Let me list them:1. ( c = 1 ), ( k = 18 )2. ( c = 2 ), ( k = 9 )3. ( c = 3 ), ( k = 6 )4. ( c = 6 ), ( k = 3 )5. ( c = 9 ), ( k = 2 )6. ( c = 18 ), ( k = 1 )But wait, ( k ) is the number of divisors of ( n ). So, ( k ) must be equal to the number of divisors of ( n ), which is given by the formula ( (a + 1)(b + 1) ) when ( n = 2^a times 5^b ). Since ( a = b = c ), the number of divisors is ( (c + 1)^2 ). So, ( k = (c + 1)^2 ).So, from earlier, ( c k = 18 ), and ( k = (c + 1)^2 ). Therefore, substituting, we have ( c (c + 1)^2 = 18 ).So, now, we can set up the equation:( c (c + 1)^2 = 18 )We need to find positive integers ( c ) such that this equation holds. Let me try plugging in the possible values of ( c ) from the factor pairs above:1. If ( c = 1 ): ( 1 times (2)^2 = 4 neq 18 )2. If ( c = 2 ): ( 2 times (3)^2 = 18 ). Oh, that works!3. If ( c = 3 ): ( 3 times (4)^2 = 48 neq 18 )4. If ( c = 6 ): ( 6 times (7)^2 = 294 neq 18 )5. If ( c = 9 ): ( 9 times (10)^2 = 900 neq 18 )6. If ( c = 18 ): ( 18 times (19)^2 = 6846 neq 18 )So, the only solution is ( c = 2 ). Therefore, ( a = b = 2 ), and ( k = (2 + 1)^2 = 9 ).So, ( n = 2^2 times 5^2 = 4 times 25 = 100 ).Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let's compute the product of all divisors of 100.First, find all the divisors of 100. Since ( 100 = 2^2 times 5^2 ), the number of divisors is ( (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 9 ). The divisors are:1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.Now, let's compute the product:1 × 2 × 4 × 5 × 10 × 20 × 25 × 50 × 100.Hmm, that's a bit tedious, but let's compute step by step.First, pair the divisors such that each pair multiplies to 100:1 × 100 = 1002 × 50 = 1004 × 25 = 1005 × 20 = 10010 × 10 = 100Wait, but 10 is repeated, but in reality, 10 is only once. So, actually, the middle divisor is 10, which is the square root of 100. So, the product is ( 100^{(9 - 1)/2} times 10 ). Wait, maybe I should use the formula.The product of all divisors is ( n^{k/2} ). So, ( 100^{9/2} = (10^2)^{9/2} = 10^9 ). Yes, that's correct. So, the product is indeed ( 10^9 ).But wait, is 100 the only solution? Let me think.Earlier, I assumed that ( a = b ). Is that necessarily true? Because both ( a k = 18 ) and ( b k = 18 ). So, unless ( a = b ), we can have different exponents. Wait, but if ( a ) and ( b ) are different, then ( a k = 18 ) and ( b k = 18 ) would imply that ( a = b ), since ( k ) is the same. So, yeah, ( a ) must equal ( b ). Therefore, 100 is the only solution.Wait, but let me test another possibility. Suppose ( n ) is a square number, then the number of divisors is odd, right? So, in our case, ( k = 9 ), which is odd, so ( n ) is a square. So, 100 is a square, which fits.But could there be another ( n ) which is not of the form ( 2^a 5^b )? For example, if ( n ) had another prime factor, say 3, then ( n^k ) would have 3 as a prime factor, but ( 10^{18} ) doesn't have 3 as a prime factor. Therefore, ( n ) cannot have any prime factors other than 2 and 5. So, ( n ) must be of the form ( 2^a 5^b ).Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 100 ).Wait, but let me make sure. Let me check another possible value for ( c ). Earlier, when I tried ( c = 2 ), it worked. What if ( c = 1 )? Then, ( k = (1 + 1)^2 = 4 ). Then, ( a k = 1 times 4 = 4 neq 18 ). So, that doesn't work. Similarly, ( c = 3 ) gives ( k = 16 ), but ( a k = 3 times 16 = 48 neq 18 ). So, no.Alternatively, is there a case where ( c ) is not an integer? But ( c ) must be an integer because it's the exponent in the prime factorization. So, no.Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 100 ).Wait, but hold on. Let me think about the case when ( k = 1 ). If ( k = 1 ), then ( n ) has only one divisor, which is itself. So, ( n = 1 ). Then, the product of all divisors is 1. But ( 1 neq 10^9 ). So, that's not a solution.Similarly, if ( k = 2 ), then ( n ) is prime. Then, the product of its divisors is ( n times 1 = n ). So, ( n = 10^9 ). But wait, let's check if ( n = 10^9 ) satisfies the condition.Wait, ( n = 10^9 ) is ( 2^9 times 5^9 ). The number of divisors ( k = (9 + 1)(9 + 1) = 100 ). Then, the product of all divisors is ( n^{k/2} = (10^9)^{50} = 10^{450} ), which is way bigger than ( 10^9 ). So, that doesn't work.Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, we had ( c k = 18 ). If ( k = 2 ), then ( c = 9 ). So, ( n = 2^9 times 5^9 = 10^9 ). But as we saw, the product is ( 10^{450} ), which is not ( 10^9 ). So, that doesn't satisfy the condition.Therefore, ( k = 2 ) is invalid because it leads to a product much larger than ( 10^9 ). Similarly, ( k = 3 ) would give ( c = 6 ), so ( n = 2^6 times 5^6 = 10^6 ). Then, the number of divisors is ( (6 + 1)(6 + 1) = 49 ). The product is ( (10^6)^{49/2} = 10^{147} ), which is still way larger than ( 10^9 ).Wait, so perhaps only when ( k = 9 ), which gives ( c = 2 ), do we get ( n = 100 ), whose product of divisors is ( 10^9 ). So, that seems to be the only solution.Wait, let me check another case. Suppose ( c = 0 ). Then, ( n = 2^0 times 5^0 = 1 ). The product of its divisors is 1, which is not ( 10^9 ). So, that's not a solution.Alternatively, if ( c = 0 ) for one of the primes, say ( a = 0 ), ( b = c ). Then, ( n = 5^c ). Then, the number of divisors is ( (0 + 1)(c + 1) = c + 1 ). Then, ( a k = 0 times (c + 1) = 0 neq 18 ). So, that doesn't work. Similarly, if ( b = 0 ), same issue.Therefore, both ( a ) and ( b ) must be positive integers.So, to recap, ( n ) must be of the form ( 2^a 5^b ), with ( a = b = c ), such that ( c (c + 1)^2 = 18 ). The only integer solution is ( c = 2 ), leading to ( n = 100 ).Therefore, the only natural number ( n ) satisfying the condition is 100.**Final Answer**The natural number ( n ) is boxed{100}."},{"question":"Given that the graph of the power function f(x) = x^{alpha} (alpha is a real constant) passes through the point (2, sqrt{2}), find f(16).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the graph of the power function f(x) = x^α passes through the point (2, sqrt(2)). I need to find f(16). Hmm, let's see. I remember that a power function is of the form f(x) = x^α, where α is a constant. So, in this case, the function is given as f(x) = x^α, and it goes through the point (2, sqrt(2)). That means when x is 2, f(x) is sqrt(2). So, I can plug those values into the equation to find α.Let me write that down. If x is 2, then f(2) = 2^α = sqrt(2). So, 2^α equals sqrt(2). I need to solve for α. Hmm, I know that sqrt(2) is the same as 2^(1/2). So, 2^α = 2^(1/2). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, α must be 1/2. So, α is 1/2.Wait, let me make sure I did that right. If I have 2^α = sqrt(2), and sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), then yes, α is 1/2. That makes sense because if you take 2 to the power of 1/2, you get sqrt(2). So, that seems correct.Now that I know α is 1/2, the function f(x) is x^(1/2), which is the square root of x. So, f(x) = sqrt(x). Now, the question is asking for f(16). So, I need to compute f(16) = 16^(1/2). Hmm, 16^(1/2) is the square root of 16, which is 4. So, f(16) should be 4.Wait, let me double-check. If f(x) is x^(1/2), then f(16) is sqrt(16). And sqrt(16) is indeed 4 because 4 times 4 is 16. So, that seems right.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. The function is f(x) = x^α, passes through (2, sqrt(2)). So, plug in x=2, f(x)=sqrt(2). So, 2^α = sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^α = 2^(1/2), which implies α = 1/2. So, f(x) = x^(1/2). Then, f(16) = 16^(1/2) = 4. Yep, that all checks out.I was a bit worried that maybe I misapplied the exponent rules, but it seems okay. I remember that when you have the same base, you can set the exponents equal if the expressions are equal. So, 2^α = 2^(1/2) implies α = 1/2. That's a basic exponent rule, so that should be correct.Another thing I thought about was whether the function could be something else, but since it's specified as a power function, it's definitely of the form x^α. So, there's no other form to consider here. It's straightforward.I also considered if maybe I made a mistake in calculating sqrt(16). But no, 4 squared is 16, so sqrt(16) is definitely 4. So, f(16) is 4.So, just to recap: Given f(x) = x^α passes through (2, sqrt(2)), so 2^α = sqrt(2). Solving for α gives α = 1/2. Therefore, f(x) = x^(1/2). Then, f(16) = 16^(1/2) = 4. So, the answer is 4.I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems pretty straightforward once you recognize that sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2). So, I feel confident that f(16) is 4.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(16) ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Is it true that at the vertices of any triangle, one can place positive numbers so that the sum of the numbers at the ends of each side of the triangle equals the length of that side?","answer":"Okay, so I came across this interesting problem: \\"Is it true that at the vertices of any triangle, one can place positive numbers so that the sum of the numbers at the ends of each side of the triangle equals the length of that side?\\" Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around this.First off, let me visualize a triangle. Let's say the triangle has vertices A, B, and C, and the lengths of the sides opposite these vertices are a, b, and c respectively. So, side opposite A is a, opposite B is b, and opposite C is c. Got it.Now, the problem is asking if we can assign positive numbers to each vertex such that the sum of the numbers at the ends of each side equals the length of that side. Let me denote the numbers at vertices A, B, and C as x, y, and z respectively. So, according to the problem, we should have:1. x + y = a (since side opposite C is a, which connects A and B)2. y + z = b (side opposite A is b, connecting B and C)3. z + x = c (side opposite B is c, connecting C and A)So, we have a system of three equations:1. x + y = a2. y + z = b3. z + x = cOur goal is to find positive numbers x, y, z that satisfy these equations. If such numbers exist for any triangle, then the answer is yes; otherwise, no.Let me try to solve this system of equations. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c.From equation 1: x = a - yFrom equation 2: z = b - yNow, substitute x and z into equation 3:z + x = c(b - y) + (a - y) = cb + a - 2y = cSo, 2y = a + b - cTherefore, y = (a + b - c)/2Similarly, from equation 1: x = a - y = a - (a + b - c)/2 = (2a - a - b + c)/2 = (a - b + c)/2From equation 2: z = b - y = b - (a + b - c)/2 = (2b - a - b + c)/2 = (-a + b + c)/2So, we have:x = (a - b + c)/2y = (a + b - c)/2z = (-a + b + c)/2Now, since x, y, z must be positive numbers, each of these expressions must be greater than zero.So, let's write down the conditions:1. x > 0 ⇒ (a - b + c)/2 > 0 ⇒ a - b + c > 0 ⇒ a + c > b2. y > 0 ⇒ (a + b - c)/2 > 0 ⇒ a + b - c > 0 ⇒ a + b > c3. z > 0 ⇒ (-a + b + c)/2 > 0 ⇒ -a + b + c > 0 ⇒ b + c > aWait a second, these are the triangle inequalities! For any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a are always true for a valid triangle.Therefore, each of x, y, z is positive because each numerator is positive, and since we're dividing by 2, which is positive, the result is positive.So, for any triangle, these values of x, y, z will satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, it is indeed true that at the vertices of any triangle, one can place positive numbers such that the sum of the numbers at the ends of each side equals the length of that side.But wait, let me double-check with an example to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Let's take a simple triangle with sides a=3, b=4, c=5 (a right-angled triangle). Let's compute x, y, z.x = (3 - 4 + 5)/2 = (4)/2 = 2y = (3 + 4 - 5)/2 = (2)/2 = 1z = (-3 + 4 + 5)/2 = (6)/2 = 3So, x=2, y=1, z=3.Let's check the sums:x + y = 2 + 1 = 3 = a ✔️y + z = 1 + 3 = 4 = b ✔️z + x = 3 + 2 = 5 = c ✔️Perfect, it works for this triangle.Let me try another triangle, maybe an equilateral triangle with sides a=2, b=2, c=2.Compute x, y, z:x = (2 - 2 + 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1y = (2 + 2 - 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1z = (-2 + 2 + 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1So, x=1, y=1, z=1.Check the sums:1 + 1 = 2 ✔️1 + 1 = 2 ✔️1 + 1 = 2 ✔️Works again.What about an isosceles triangle, say a=5, b=5, c=6.Compute x, y, z:x = (5 - 5 + 6)/2 = 6/2 = 3y = (5 + 5 - 6)/2 = 4/2 = 2z = (-5 + 5 + 6)/2 = 6/2 = 3So, x=3, y=2, z=3.Check sums:3 + 2 = 5 ✔️2 + 3 = 5 ✔️3 + 3 = 6 ✔️Perfect.Wait, let me try a degenerate triangle, but actually, a degenerate triangle isn't a valid triangle because one side equals the sum of the other two, which violates the triangle inequality. So, in that case, the triangle inequalities wouldn't hold, and hence, the numbers x, y, z might not be positive. But since the problem states \\"any triangle,\\" which I assume is a non-degenerate triangle, so the triangle inequalities are satisfied, so x, y, z are positive.Therefore, it seems that the answer is yes, it's always possible.But just to be thorough, let me consider a triangle with sides a=1, b=1, c=1.999. This is a very \\"flat\\" triangle, almost degenerate, but still valid since 1 + 1 > 1.999.Compute x, y, z:x = (1 - 1 + 1.999)/2 = 1.999/2 ≈ 0.9995y = (1 + 1 - 1.999)/2 = 0.001/2 = 0.0005z = (-1 + 1 + 1.999)/2 = 1.999/2 ≈ 0.9995So, x ≈ 0.9995, y ≈ 0.0005, z ≈ 0.9995Check the sums:x + y ≈ 0.9995 + 0.0005 = 1 ✔️y + z ≈ 0.0005 + 0.9995 = 1 ✔️z + x ≈ 0.9995 + 0.9995 ≈ 1.999 ✔️So, even in this case, the numbers are positive, albeit very small for y.Therefore, as long as the triangle is valid (satisfies triangle inequalities), the numbers x, y, z will be positive.Therefore, the answer is yes, it's always possible.**Final Answer**boxed{Yes}"},{"question":"A certain program, as shown in the figure, when the input x is 5, the output value is ______.<br/>Input xrightarrow  squarerightarrow  subtract xrightarrow  divide by 2rightarrow  take the oppositerightarrow  output","answer":"To determine the output when the input ( x ) is 5, I will follow the sequence of operations provided.First, I square the input: ( 5^2 = 25 ).Next, I subtract the original input from this result: ( 25 - 5 = 20 ).Then, I divide the result by 2: ( 20 div 2 = 10 ).Finally, I take the opposite of this value: ( -10 ).Therefore, when the input ( x ) is 5, the output is -10."},{"question":"Aunt Wang walked around a square playground for 2 laps and covered a distance of 400 meters.

Determine the monotonicity of the function f(x) and prove it using the definition method.2. If a = 1, calculate the value of f(-5) + f(-3) + f(-1) + f(1) + f(3) + f(5).","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) = a - 2/(2^x + 1), where a is a real number. There are two parts to the problem. The first part is to determine the monotonicity of f(x) and prove it using the definition method. The second part is, if a = 1, to calculate the sum f(-5) + f(-3) + f(-1) + f(1) + f(3) + f(5). Hmm, okay, let's tackle each part step by step.Starting with part 1: determining the monotonicity of f(x). Monotonicity refers to whether the function is increasing or decreasing over its domain. To prove this using the definition method, I think I need to show that for any two points x1 and x2 where x1 < x2, either f(x1) < f(x2) (if increasing) or f(x1) > f(x2) (if decreasing). Alternatively, I can compute the difference f(x2) - f(x1) and show it's positive or negative.But wait, another approach is to compute the derivative of f(x). If the derivative is positive everywhere, the function is increasing; if negative everywhere, it's decreasing. Since the problem mentions using the definition method, maybe they want me to use the difference quotient or something without calculus. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I can analyze the function f(x) by breaking it down. The function is a constant a minus another function, which is 2/(2^x + 1). So, if I can determine whether 2/(2^x + 1) is increasing or decreasing, then I can figure out the monotonicity of f(x).Let me consider the function g(x) = 2/(2^x + 1). Let's see if g(x) is increasing or decreasing. To do this, I can compute the difference g(x2) - g(x1) for x2 > x1 and see if it's positive or negative.So, g(x2) - g(x1) = [2/(2^{x2} + 1)] - [2/(2^{x1} + 1)]. Let's compute this:= 2[1/(2^{x2} + 1) - 1/(2^{x1} + 1)]= 2[(2^{x1} + 1 - 2^{x2} - 1)/((2^{x2} + 1)(2^{x1} + 1))]= 2[(2^{x1} - 2^{x2}) / ((2^{x2} + 1)(2^{x1} + 1))]Now, since x2 > x1, 2^{x2} > 2^{x1} because the exponential function is increasing. Therefore, 2^{x1} - 2^{x2} is negative. The denominator is always positive because 2^x is always positive, so (2^{x2} + 1)(2^{x1} + 1) > 0. Therefore, the entire expression is negative. So, g(x2) - g(x1) < 0, which means g(x) is decreasing.Since f(x) = a - g(x), and g(x) is decreasing, then f(x) is increasing because subtracting a decreasing function makes the overall function increasing. So, f(x) is monotonically increasing.Wait, let me verify this. If g(x) is decreasing, then -g(x) is increasing, so adding a constant a doesn't change the monotonicity. So yes, f(x) is increasing. So, that's part 1.Alternatively, if I were to use calculus, I could compute the derivative f'(x). Let's see, f(x) = a - 2/(2^x + 1). The derivative of a is 0. The derivative of 2/(2^x + 1) is -2*(derivative of denominator)/(denominator)^2. The derivative of 2^x is ln(2)*2^x. So,f'(x) = 0 - [ -2*(ln(2)*2^x) / (2^x + 1)^2 ] = 2 ln(2) 2^x / (2^x + 1)^2.Since 2 ln(2) 2^x is positive for all x, and the denominator is always positive, f'(x) is positive everywhere. Therefore, f(x) is strictly increasing. So, that confirms it as well.But since the problem says to use the definition method, maybe the first approach without calculus is better. So, I think I can conclude that f(x) is monotonically increasing because the subtracted function g(x) is decreasing.Moving on to part 2: If a = 1, calculate the sum f(-5) + f(-3) + f(-1) + f(1) + f(3) + f(5). So, first, let me write down f(x) when a = 1:f(x) = 1 - 2/(2^x + 1).So, I need to compute f at x = -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, and add them up.Let me compute each term:First, f(-5) = 1 - 2/(2^{-5} + 1) = 1 - 2/(1/32 + 1) = 1 - 2/(33/32) = 1 - (64/33) = (33/33 - 64/33) = (-31/33).Wait, hold on, let me double-check that:2^{-5} is 1/32, so 2^{-5} + 1 is 1 + 1/32 = 33/32. Then, 2 divided by that is 2*(32/33) = 64/33. So, f(-5) = 1 - 64/33 = (33/33 - 64/33) = (-31)/33. Hmm, that's correct.Similarly, f(-3) = 1 - 2/(2^{-3} + 1) = 1 - 2/(1/8 + 1) = 1 - 2/(9/8) = 1 - (16/9) = (9/9 - 16/9) = (-7)/9.Wait, 2^{-3} is 1/8, so 1/8 + 1 = 9/8, 2 divided by 9/8 is 16/9. So, 1 - 16/9 is indeed (-7)/9.f(-1) = 1 - 2/(2^{-1} + 1) = 1 - 2/(1/2 + 1) = 1 - 2/(3/2) = 1 - (4/3) = (-1)/3.Similarly, f(1) = 1 - 2/(2^1 + 1) = 1 - 2/(2 + 1) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.f(3) = 1 - 2/(2^3 + 1) = 1 - 2/(8 + 1) = 1 - 2/9 = 7/9.f(5) = 1 - 2/(2^5 + 1) = 1 - 2/(32 + 1) = 1 - 2/33 = 31/33.So, now let's list all these:f(-5) = -31/33f(-3) = -7/9f(-1) = -1/3f(1) = 1/3f(3) = 7/9f(5) = 31/33Now, let's add them up:(-31/33) + (-7/9) + (-1/3) + (1/3) + (7/9) + (31/33)Let me pair the terms:(-31/33 + 31/33) + (-7/9 + 7/9) + (-1/3 + 1/3)Each pair cancels out:0 + 0 + 0 = 0Wait, that's interesting. So, the sum is zero?But let me verify each computation step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Compute f(-5):2^{-5} = 1/32, so 2^{-5} + 1 = 33/32. Then 2 divided by that is 64/33. So, 1 - 64/33 = (33 - 64)/33 = (-31)/33. Correct.f(-3):2^{-3} = 1/8, 1/8 +1 = 9/8, 2/(9/8) = 16/9, so 1 - 16/9 = (-7)/9. Correct.f(-1):2^{-1} = 1/2, 1/2 +1 = 3/2, 2/(3/2) = 4/3, so 1 - 4/3 = (-1)/3. Correct.f(1):2^1 = 2, 2 +1 = 3, 2/3, so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. Correct.f(3):2^3 = 8, 8 +1 = 9, 2/9, so 1 - 2/9 = 7/9. Correct.f(5):2^5 = 32, 32 +1 = 33, 2/33, so 1 - 2/33 = 31/33. Correct.So, all the computations are correct.Now, adding them:(-31/33) + (-7/9) + (-1/3) + (1/3) + (7/9) + (31/33)Let me group the positive and negative terms:Negative terms: (-31/33) + (-7/9) + (-1/3)Positive terms: (1/3) + (7/9) + (31/33)Compute negative terms:Convert all to 33 denominator:-31/33 - (7/9)*(33/33) - (1/3)*(33/33)= -31/33 - (7*3.666.../33) Wait, maybe better to compute each term:-31/33 is already in 33.-7/9 = -(7* (33/9))/33 = -(7*11/3)/33? Wait, maybe better to compute each as fractions:-31/33 -7/9 -1/3Convert all to 99 denominator:-31/33 = -93/99-7/9 = -77/99-1/3 = -33/99So total negative terms: (-93 -77 -33)/99 = (-203)/99Positive terms:1/3 +7/9 +31/33Convert to 99 denominator:1/3 = 33/997/9 = 77/9931/33 = 93/99Total positive terms: (33 +77 +93)/99 = (203)/99So, total sum: (-203)/99 + 203/99 = 0.So, yes, the sum is zero.Wait, that's interesting. So, when a = 1, the sum of f at these symmetric points is zero. Is this a coincidence or is there a reason?Looking back at the function f(x) = 1 - 2/(2^x + 1). Let me see if f(x) + f(-x) equals something.Compute f(x) + f(-x):= [1 - 2/(2^x + 1)] + [1 - 2/(2^{-x} + 1)]Simplify:= 2 - 2/(2^x + 1) - 2/(2^{-x} + 1)Note that 2^{-x} = 1/(2^x). So, 2^{-x} +1 = (1 + 2^x)/2^x.Thus, 2/(2^{-x} +1) = 2/( (1 + 2^x)/2^x ) = 2*(2^x)/(1 + 2^x) = 2*2^x/(2^x +1)So, f(x) + f(-x) = 2 - 2/(2^x +1) - 2*2^x/(2^x +1)Combine the terms:= 2 - [2 + 2*2^x]/(2^x +1)= 2 - [2(1 + 2^x)]/(2^x +1)= 2 - 2 = 0.Wow, so f(x) + f(-x) = 0 for all x. That means f is an odd function when a = 1.Therefore, in the sum, each pair f(k) + f(-k) = 0. So, when we have f(-5) + f(5) =0, f(-3)+f(3)=0, f(-1)+f(1)=0. Therefore, the total sum is 0.So, that's why the sum is zero. It's because f(x) is odd when a=1, so the function is symmetric about the origin, and adding f(k) and f(-k) cancels them out.Therefore, the answer is 0.So, summarizing:1. The function f(x) is monotonically increasing because its derivative is positive everywhere, or because the subtracted function is decreasing.2. When a =1, the sum f(-5) + f(-3) + f(-1) + f(1) + f(3) + f(5) is zero because f(x) is odd, so each pair cancels out.**Final Answer**1. The function ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing.2. The value of the sum is boxed{0}."},{"question":"A rectangular billiard table with sides 1 and sqrt{2} is given. A ball is shot from one of its corners at an angle of 45^{circ} to the side. Will it ever fall into a pocket? (The pockets are located at the corners of the billiard table).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a billiard table that's rectangular with sides of length 1 and √2. A ball is shot from one of the corners at a 45-degree angle to the side. The question is whether it will ever fall into a pocket, which are located at the corners. Hmm, interesting. I remember that billiard problems often involve reflections, so maybe I need to think about how the ball bounces off the sides.First, let me visualize the table. It's a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. One side is 1 unit, and the other is √2 units. The ball starts from a corner, say the bottom-left corner, and is shot at a 45-degree angle. Since it's a 45-degree angle, that means the ball is moving equally in the x and y directions, right? So, in terms of velocity components, if I consider the table's sides as the x and y axes, the ball's velocity would have equal horizontal and vertical components.But wait, the sides are different lengths. So, the ball will take different times to reach the top and the right sides. Let me think about how reflections work in billiards. When a ball hits a side, it reflects off with the same angle it came in. So, instead of thinking about the ball bouncing, sometimes it's easier to think about reflecting the table itself. That way, the ball travels in a straight line through these reflected tables, and if it reaches a corner in any of these reflected tables, it means it would have gone into a pocket.So, if I imagine reflecting the table across its sides repeatedly, the ball's path becomes a straight line in this grid of reflected tables. The question then becomes: does this straight line ever pass through a corner of one of these reflected tables?Since the original table has sides 1 and √2, the reflected tables will create a grid where each cell is 1 unit in one direction and √2 units in the other. The ball is moving at a 45-degree angle, so in terms of the grid, it's moving with a slope of 1. So, the path is y = x + c, where c is some constant. But since the grid is made up of rectangles, not squares, the slope relative to the grid isn't 1 in terms of the actual distances.Wait, maybe I need to adjust for the different side lengths. The table is 1 by √2, so the aspect ratio is 1:√2. If I were to tile the plane with these tables, the grid would have a spacing of 1 in the x-direction and √2 in the y-direction. So, the slope of the ball's path in this grid would be (1 unit in x)/(√2 units in y) = 1/√2. Hmm, so the slope is 1/√2.But the ball is moving at a 45-degree angle relative to the sides. So, in terms of the table's coordinate system, the slope is 1. But when considering the tiling, the slope is different because of the different scaling in x and y.This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should use the method of reflections more carefully. When reflecting the table, each reflection over a vertical side (length 1) will flip the x-coordinate, and each reflection over a horizontal side (length √2) will flip the y-coordinate. So, the ball's trajectory can be represented as a straight line in this reflected grid.To determine if the ball ever reaches a corner, I need to see if the straight line passes through a point that is an integer multiple of the table's dimensions away from the starting corner. That is, the ball will reach a pocket if there exist integers m and n such that the distance traveled in the x-direction is m*1 and in the y-direction is n*√2, and the ratio of these distances corresponds to the slope of the ball's path.Since the ball is moving at a 45-degree angle, the ratio of the y-component to the x-component of its velocity is 1. So, the distance traveled in y should equal the distance traveled in x. Therefore, we need m*1 = n*√2. Simplifying, m/n = √2.But m and n are integers, so we're looking for integers m and n such that m/n equals √2. However, √2 is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. Therefore, there are no such integers m and n that satisfy this equation. This suggests that the ball will never reach a corner pocket.Wait, but hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Because when reflecting the table, the grid isn't just scaled by 1 and √2, but each reflection alternates the direction. So, perhaps the coordinates after reflections can be represented as (k*1, l*√2), where k and l are integers, positive or negative. Then, the ball's trajectory is a straight line from (0,0) with slope 1. So, the equation is y = x.We need to see if y = x intersects any point (k, l√2) where k and l are integers. So, set x = k and y = l√2, so we have l√2 = k. Therefore, we need integers k and l such that k/l = √2. Again, since √2 is irrational, there are no such integers. Therefore, the line y = x never passes through any of these grid points, meaning the ball never reaches a pocket.But wait, another thought: maybe the reflections can lead to a situation where after some number of reflections, the ball's path aligns with a corner. But since √2 is irrational, the reflections in the y-direction will never align with the x-direction reflections in a way that the ball reaches a corner.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the least common multiple of the table's sides. But since one side is 1 and the other is √2, which is irrational, their least common multiple doesn't exist in the traditional sense. So, the ball will never have traveled an integer multiple of both sides simultaneously, meaning it won't reach a corner.Another approach: parametrize the ball's motion. Let's say the ball starts at (0,0) and moves with velocity (v, v) since it's at a 45-degree angle. The position at time t is (vt, vt). The table has width 1 and height √2. So, the ball will hit a vertical wall when vt = 1, which is at t = 1/v, and a horizontal wall when vt = √2, which is at t = √2 / v.Since 1 and √2 are incommensurate (their ratio is irrational), the times when the ball hits vertical and horizontal walls will never coincide. Therefore, the ball will keep bouncing off the walls indefinitely without ever reaching a corner.Wait, but is that necessarily true? Because each reflection changes the direction, so maybe after some reflections, the ball's path could align with a corner. But given that the aspect ratio is irrational, I don't think so.Let me think about the unfolding method again. Each time the ball reflects off a vertical wall, it's like moving into a mirrored table next to the original. Similarly, reflecting off a horizontal wall moves it into a table above or below. So, the ball's path is a straight line in this grid of mirrored tables.The coordinates of the pockets in this grid would be at points (m, n√2) where m and n are integers. The ball's path is y = x, so we need to see if y = x passes through any such points. That is, does x = m and y = n√2 satisfy y = x? So, m = n√2. Again, since √2 is irrational, m/n = √2, which is impossible for integers m and n. Therefore, the ball never reaches a pocket.Alternatively, maybe the ball could reach a corner after an even number of reflections, both in x and y directions. But even so, the distances would have to satisfy the same condition, which they can't because of the irrational ratio.Wait, another thought: perhaps the number of reflections needed to reach a corner is related to the continued fraction expansion of √2. Since √2 is irrational, its continued fraction is infinite and doesn't repeat, meaning that the ball would never exactly reach a corner, only approach it arbitrarily closely.So, putting it all together, since the ratio of the table's sides is irrational, the ball's trajectory, which has a slope of 1, will never align with any corner in the grid of reflected tables. Therefore, the ball will never fall into a pocket.But just to double-check, let's consider the least common multiple idea. If the table had sides with a rational ratio, say p/q, then after p reflections in one direction and q in the other, the ball would reach a corner. But since √2 is irrational, there's no such p and q, so the ball never reaches a corner.Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is no, the ball will never fall into a pocket.**Final Answer**The ball will never fall into a pocket, so the answer is boxed{No}.**Final Answer**boxed{No}"},{"question":"The product of five numbers is not equal to zero. Each of these numbers was decreased by one, and their product did not change. Provide an example of such numbers.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: The product of five numbers is not equal to zero. Each of these numbers was decreased by one, and their product did not change. I need to provide an example of such numbers. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me parse the problem. There are five numbers, let's call them a, b, c, d, e. Their product is not zero, which means none of them can be zero because if any were zero, the product would be zero. So, all five numbers are non-zero.Now, each of these numbers is decreased by one, so we have (a - 1), (b - 1), (c - 1), (d - 1), (e - 1). The product of these new numbers is equal to the original product. So, mathematically, this can be written as:a * b * c * d * e = (a - 1) * (b - 1) * (c - 1) * (d - 1) * (e - 1)Okay, so I need to find five numbers where this equation holds true. Since all numbers are non-zero, I have to be careful about that.I wonder if there's a simple set of numbers that satisfy this condition. Maybe some numbers that when decreased by one, their product remains the same. Let me think about possible candidates.One idea is to consider numbers that are reciprocals or something like that. Because if you have a number and its reciprocal, their product is 1, which might help in keeping the overall product the same.Wait, but we have five numbers, not just two. So maybe if I have some numbers greater than 1 and some less than 1, such that when each is decreased by one, the product remains the same.Alternatively, maybe using 1s and 0s, but wait, the numbers can't be zero because the original product isn't zero. So, 1s are allowed because 1 is non-zero. But if I have a 1, then (1 - 1) = 0, which would make the product zero. But the original product isn't zero, so that can't happen. Therefore, none of the numbers can be 1 either because that would make one of the terms in the new product zero, which would make the entire product zero, contradicting the original product being non-zero.So, all numbers must be different from 1 as well. So, all numbers are non-zero and not equal to 1.Hmm, okay, so maybe numbers that when decreased by one, the product remains the same. Let me think about specific numbers.What if I take numbers that are symmetric around 1? For example, if I have a number x, then maybe 2 - x? Because if x is 2 - x, then x = 1, but we can't have 1. So, maybe something else.Wait, let's think about the equation again:a * b * c * d * e = (a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1)(d - 1)(e - 1)Let me denote P = a * b * c * d * e. Then, the equation becomes P = (a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1)(d - 1)(e - 1). So, P is equal to the product of each number decreased by one.I need to find numbers where this holds. Maybe if I set some numbers to be 2, because 2 - 1 = 1, which is non-zero. Let me try that.Suppose I have four numbers as 2 and one number as something else. Let's see:Let a = b = c = d = 2, and e = x.Then, the original product is 2^4 * x = 16x.The new product is (2 - 1)^4 * (x - 1) = 1^4 * (x - 1) = x - 1.So, setting 16x = x - 1. That would give 15x = -1, so x = -1/15.So, the numbers would be 2, 2, 2, 2, and -1/15.Let me check if this works.Original product: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * (-1/15) = 16 * (-1/15) = -16/15.New product: (2 - 1)^4 * (-1/15 - 1) = 1^4 * (-16/15) = -16/15.Yes, that works! So, the numbers are 2, 2, 2, 2, and -1/15.Wait, but is this the only solution? Probably not, but it's a valid example.Alternatively, maybe using more numbers that are not 2. Let me see.Suppose I have three numbers as 2 and two numbers as something else. Let's say a = b = c = 2, d = y, e = z.Original product: 8 * y * z.New product: 1^3 * (y - 1)(z - 1).So, 8yz = (y - 1)(z - 1).This is a bit more complex, but maybe we can find y and z such that this holds.Let me set y = z for simplicity. Then, 8y^2 = (y - 1)^2.So, 8y^2 = y^2 - 2y + 1.Bringing all terms to one side: 7y^2 + 2y - 1 = 0.Solving this quadratic equation: y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 28)] / 14 = [-2 ± sqrt(32)] / 14 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(2)] / 14 = [-1 ± 2*sqrt(2)] / 7.So, y could be (-1 + 2√2)/7 ≈ (-1 + 2.828)/7 ≈ 1.828/7 ≈ 0.261, or y = (-1 - 2√2)/7 ≈ negative number.But since we need the original product to be non-zero, and y can be positive or negative, but let's check if y is positive.So, y ≈ 0.261, then z = y ≈ 0.261.So, the numbers would be 2, 2, 2, 0.261, 0.261.Let me check the original product: 2*2*2*0.261*0.261 ≈ 8 * 0.068 ≈ 0.544.New product: (2-1)^3*(0.261-1)^2 ≈ 1*1*(-0.739)^2 ≈ 1*0.546 ≈ 0.546.Hmm, close enough considering the approximation. So, this also works.But the first example with four 2s and one -1/15 is simpler, so maybe that's a better example.Alternatively, maybe using numbers like 3 and 1/2. Let me try.Suppose I have two 3s and three 1/2s.Original product: 3*3*(1/2)^3 = 9*(1/8) = 9/8.New product: (3-1)^2*(1/2 -1)^3 = 2^2*(-1/2)^3 = 4*(-1/8) = -0.5.But 9/8 is not equal to -0.5, so that doesn't work.Hmm, okay, maybe another approach.Let me think about the equation again:a*b*c*d*e = (a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1)(d - 1)(e - 1)Let me divide both sides by a*b*c*d*e, assuming none are zero, which they aren't.So, 1 = [(a - 1)/a] * [(b - 1)/b] * [(c - 1)/c] * [(d - 1)/d] * [(e - 1)/e]Which simplifies to:1 = product from i=1 to 5 of (1 - 1/x_i), where x_i are the numbers.So, the product of (1 - 1/x_i) equals 1.Hmm, interesting. So, the product of these terms is 1.I need to find five numbers x_i such that the product of (1 - 1/x_i) is 1.Alternatively, taking logarithms, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, maybe choosing numbers such that (1 - 1/x_i) are reciprocals or something.Wait, but the product is 1, so maybe each term is 1, but that would require x_i to be infinity, which isn't practical.Alternatively, maybe some terms are greater than 1 and some less than 1, such that their product is 1.For example, if I have two terms as 2 and three terms as 1/2, then the product would be (1 - 1/2)^2 * (1 - 2/1)^3 = (1/2)^2 * (-1)^3 = (1/4)*(-1) = -1/4, which isn't 1.Not helpful.Alternatively, maybe having some terms as 3 and others as something else.Wait, let me think about the first example I had: four 2s and one -1/15.So, (1 - 1/2)^4 * (1 - 1/(-1/15)) = (1/2)^4 * (1 + 15) = (1/16)*16 = 1. Yes, that works.So, that's why that example works.So, in that case, four of the terms are (1 - 1/2) = 1/2, and one term is (1 - 1/(-1/15)) = 1 + 15 = 16.So, 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 16 = 1.So, that's how it works.Therefore, to construct such numbers, we can have four numbers as 2, and the fifth number as -1/(16 - 1) = -1/15, because when you take (1 - 1/x), you want that term to be 16 to balance the four 1/2s.Wait, let me explain:If I have four numbers as 2, then each (1 - 1/2) = 1/2. So, four of them multiply to (1/2)^4 = 1/16.To get the total product to be 1, the fifth term must be 16, because 1/16 * 16 = 1.So, (1 - 1/x) = 16 => 1 - 16 = 1/x => -15 = 1/x => x = -1/15.Yes, that makes sense.So, that's how we get four 2s and one -1/15.Alternatively, we could have a different distribution. For example, three numbers as 2, and two numbers such that their (1 - 1/x) terms multiply to 1/(1/2)^3 = 8.So, (1 - 1/x1)*(1 - 1/x2) = 8.But 8 is greater than 1, so we need terms greater than 1.So, (1 - 1/x) > 1 implies that -1/x > 0, so x < 0.So, x is negative.Let me set x1 = x2 = x.Then, (1 - 1/x)^2 = 8.So, 1 - 1/x = sqrt(8) or -sqrt(8).But 1 - 1/x must be positive because sqrt(8) is positive, and if it's negative, then 1 - 1/x = -2√2, which would make 1/x = 1 + 2√2, which is positive, so x would be positive, but then 1 - 1/x would be less than 1, which contradicts.Wait, let me solve it properly.(1 - 1/x)^2 = 8So, 1 - 1/x = ±2√2Case 1: 1 - 1/x = 2√2Then, -1/x = 2√2 - 1So, 1/x = 1 - 2√2Thus, x = 1/(1 - 2√2) = (1 + 2√2)/( (1)^2 - (2√2)^2 ) = (1 + 2√2)/(1 - 8) = (1 + 2√2)/(-7) = -(1 + 2√2)/7Case 2: 1 - 1/x = -2√2Then, -1/x = -2√2 -1So, 1/x = 2√2 +1Thus, x = 1/(2√2 +1) = (2√2 -1)/( (2√2)^2 -1^2 ) = (2√2 -1)/(8 -1) = (2√2 -1)/7So, x could be -(1 + 2√2)/7 or (2√2 -1)/7.So, if I take two numbers as (2√2 -1)/7, then the product would be:(1 - 1/x)^2 = (1 - 7/(2√2 -1))^2.Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/x where x = (2√2 -1)/7.1 - 1/x = 1 - 7/(2√2 -1) = (2√2 -1 -7)/(2√2 -1) = (2√2 -8)/(2√2 -1)Hmm, that doesn't seem to be 2√2. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, no, actually, in this case, we set (1 - 1/x)^2 = 8, so 1 - 1/x = ±2√2.But when x = (2√2 -1)/7, 1 - 1/x = 2√2.Wait, let me compute 1/x:x = (2√2 -1)/7, so 1/x = 7/(2√2 -1). Multiply numerator and denominator by (2√2 +1):1/x = 7*(2√2 +1)/( (2√2)^2 -1^2 ) = 7*(2√2 +1)/(8 -1) = 7*(2√2 +1)/7 = 2√2 +1.So, 1 - 1/x = 1 - (2√2 +1) = -2√2.Ah, so 1 - 1/x = -2√2, which squared is 8. So, that works.Therefore, if I take two numbers as x = (2√2 -1)/7, then (1 - 1/x)^2 = 8.So, in this case, if I have three numbers as 2, and two numbers as (2√2 -1)/7, then the product would be:(1/2)^3 * (-2√2)^2 = (1/8) * 8 = 1.So, that works as well.Therefore, another set of numbers could be 2, 2, 2, (2√2 -1)/7, (2√2 -1)/7.But this seems more complicated than the first example with four 2s and one -1/15.So, maybe the first example is simpler.Alternatively, maybe using other numbers.Wait, another idea: if I have two numbers as 3 and three numbers as something else.Let me try:Let a = b = 3, and c = d = e = x.Original product: 9x^3.New product: (3 -1)^2 * (x -1)^3 = 4*(x -1)^3.So, 9x^3 = 4(x -1)^3.Let me solve for x:9x^3 = 4(x -1)^3Divide both sides by (x -1)^3:9(x/(x -1))^3 = 4So, (x/(x -1))^3 = 4/9Take cube roots:x/(x -1) = (4/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.7368So, x ≈ 0.7368(x -1)x ≈ 0.7368x - 0.7368x - 0.7368x ≈ -0.73680.2632x ≈ -0.7368x ≈ -0.7368 / 0.2632 ≈ -2.799So, x ≈ -2.8.Let me check:Original product: 3*3*(-2.8)^3 ≈ 9*(-21.952) ≈ -197.568New product: (3-1)^2*(-2.8 -1)^3 ≈ 4*(-3.8)^3 ≈ 4*(-54.872) ≈ -219.488Hmm, not equal. So, maybe my approximation is off.Wait, let me compute more accurately.Let me write the equation again:9x^3 = 4(x -1)^3Let me expand (x -1)^3:x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x -1So, 9x^3 = 4x^3 -12x^2 +12x -4Bring all terms to left:9x^3 -4x^3 +12x^2 -12x +4 =05x^3 +12x^2 -12x +4=0Hmm, solving this cubic equation.Let me try rational roots. Possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±1/5, etc.Testing x=1: 5 +12 -12 +4=9≠0x=-1: -5 +12 +12 +4=23≠0x=2: 40 +48 -24 +4=68≠0x=-2: -40 +48 +24 +4=36≠0x= -4: -320 + 192 +48 +4= -76≠0x=1/5: 5*(1/125) +12*(1/25) -12*(1/5) +4= 1/25 + 12/25 -12/5 +4= (13/25) - (60/25) + (100/25)= (13 -60 +100)/25=53/25≠0x= -1/5: 5*(-1/125) +12*(1/25) -12*(-1/5) +4= -1/25 +12/25 +12/5 +4= (11/25) + (60/25) + (100/25)=171/25≠0So, no rational roots. Maybe need to use the cubic formula or numerical methods.Alternatively, maybe this approach isn't the best. Let me try another idea.Wait, going back to the first example, four 2s and one -1/15 works. Maybe that's the simplest example.Alternatively, maybe using numbers like 3 and -1/2.Wait, let me try:Suppose I have two numbers as 3 and three numbers as -1/2.Original product: 3*3*(-1/2)^3 = 9*(-1/8) = -9/8.New product: (3 -1)^2*(-1/2 -1)^3 = 2^2*(-3/2)^3 = 4*(-27/8) = -108/8 = -13.5.Not equal to -9/8.So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe three numbers as 3 and two numbers as something else.But this might get too complicated.Alternatively, maybe using numbers like 4 and -1/3.Wait, let me try:Suppose I have one number as 4 and four numbers as -1/3.Original product: 4*(-1/3)^4 = 4*(1/81) = 4/81.New product: (4 -1)*(-1/3 -1)^4 = 3*(-4/3)^4 = 3*(256/81) = 768/81 ≈ 9.48.Not equal to 4/81.So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe two numbers as 4 and three numbers as something else.But this is getting too time-consuming.I think the first example I found is the simplest: four 2s and one -1/15.So, let me verify it again.Numbers: 2, 2, 2, 2, -1/15.Original product: 2*2*2*2*(-1/15) = 16*(-1/15) = -16/15.New product: (2-1)^4*(-1/15 -1) = 1^4*(-16/15) = -16/15.Yes, same as original product.So, that works.Therefore, an example of such numbers is four 2s and one -1/15.Alternatively, I can write them as 2, 2, 2, 2, -1/15.I think that's a valid and simple example.Another thought: maybe using more numbers, but I think four 2s and one -1/15 is the simplest.Alternatively, maybe using other numbers, but I think this is the most straightforward.So, I think I'll go with that as the example."},{"question":"In the figure, PA is tangent to semicircle SAR, PB is tangent to semicircle RBT, and SRT is a straight line.

Let me try to visualize it first. There's a figure with two semicircles, SAR and RBT, and SRT is a straight line. PA is tangent to the first semicircle, and PB is tangent to the second one. The arcs AS and BT are given as 58 degrees and 37 degrees, respectively. I need to find the measure of angle APB.Hmm, okay. Let me recall some geometry concepts. When a tangent is drawn to a circle, the angle between the tangent and the radius at the point of contact is 90 degrees. That might be useful here since PA and PB are tangents.First, let me note down the given information:- Arc AS is 58 degrees.- Arc BT is 37 degrees.- SRT is a straight line, so points S, R, T are colinear.- PA is tangent to semicircle SAR.- PB is tangent to semicircle RBT.I think it might help to draw a diagram or at least sketch it mentally. There's a straight line SRT. On this line, there are two semicircles: one above SAR and another above RBT. So, semicircle SAR is above the line SRT, and semicircle RBT is also above the same line. Points A and B are on these semicircles, respectively.PA is tangent to semicircle SAR at point A, and PB is tangent to semicircle RBT at point B. So, point P is outside both semicircles, and PA and PB are the tangent lines from P to each semicircle.Since PA is tangent to the first semicircle, the radius from the center of that semicircle to point A is perpendicular to PA. Similarly, the radius from the center of the second semicircle to point B is perpendicular to PB.Let me denote the centers of the semicircles. For semicircle SAR, the center should be the midpoint of SR. Similarly, for semicircle RBT, the center should be the midpoint of RT.Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it defines points S, R, T with specific coordinates. Let me parse that:- S is at (-2*r1, 0)- R is at (0,0)- T is at (2*r2, 0)- A is O1 + dir(180 - 58)*r1- B is O2 + dir(37)*r2Where O1 is (-r1, 0), and O2 is (r2, 0). So, semicircle SAR has center at (-r1, 0) and radius r1, and semicircle RBT has center at (r2, 0) and radius r2.So, point A is on the first semicircle, and point B is on the second semicircle.Given that arc AS is 58 degrees, which is the measure of the arc from A to S on the first semicircle. Similarly, arc BT is 37 degrees, the measure from B to T on the second semicircle.Since these are semicircles, the total measure is 180 degrees. So, the arc from S to A is 58 degrees, meaning the central angle for arc SA is 58 degrees. Similarly, the arc from B to T is 37 degrees, so the central angle for arc BT is 37 degrees.Therefore, the central angles for arcs SA and BT are 58° and 37°, respectively.Since SRT is a straight line, the centers O1 and O2 are on this line, as well as points S, R, T.Let me try to find the positions of points A and B.For point A on semicircle SAR, since arc SA is 58°, the central angle ∠SO1A is 58°. Similarly, for point B on semicircle RBT, the central angle ∠RO2B is 37°.Given that, point A is located 58° above the diameter SR, and point B is located 37° above the diameter RT.Since PA is tangent to the first semicircle at A, the radius O1A is perpendicular to PA. Similarly, radius O2B is perpendicular to PB.Therefore, triangles O1AP and O2BP are right-angled at A and B, respectively.So, if I can find the lengths of O1A, O2B, and the distances from P to O1 and O2, perhaps I can find some relationships.But maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the angles involved.Since PA is tangent to the first semicircle, the angle between PA and the radius O1A is 90°. Similarly, the angle between PB and O2B is 90°.Therefore, if I can find the angles at O1 and O2, maybe I can relate them to angle APB.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the property that the angle between two tangents can be related to the arcs they intercept.Wait, in circle geometry, the angle between two tangents from a common external point is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.But in this case, the two semicircles are separate, so I'm not sure if that applies directly.Wait, but maybe I can consider the two tangent points and the centers.Let me denote:- O1 as the center of semicircle SAR.- O2 as the center of semicircle RBT.So, O1 is the midpoint of SR, and O2 is the midpoint of RT.Given that S is at (-2r1, 0), R is at (0,0), and T is at (2r2, 0). So, O1 is at (-r1, 0), and O2 is at (r2, 0).Given that, the distance between O1 and O2 is r1 + r2, since O1 is at (-r1,0) and O2 is at (r2, 0). So, the distance between them is r1 + r2.But wait, in the Asymptote code, r1 is 1 and r2 is 0.8. So, O1 is at (-1,0), O2 is at (0.8,0), and the distance between them is 1 + 0.8 = 1.8 units.But maybe the exact radii aren't necessary. Let me see.Alternatively, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to all points.Given that, let me set up a coordinate system where R is at (0,0). Then, S is at (-2r1, 0), and T is at (2r2, 0). O1 is at (-r1, 0), and O2 is at (r2, 0).Point A is on semicircle SAR, 58° from S. So, in polar coordinates, with center O1, point A is at an angle of 180° - 58° = 122° from the positive x-axis.Similarly, point B is on semicircle RBT, 37° from T. So, with center O2, point B is at an angle of 37° from the positive x-axis.Wait, let me confirm that.For semicircle SAR, since it's a semicircle above SR, the angle from O1 to S is 180°, and moving 58° towards A, so point A is at 180° - 58° = 122° from the positive x-axis.Similarly, for semicircle RBT, the angle from O2 to T is 0°, and moving 37° towards B, so point B is at 37° from the positive x-axis.Therefore, coordinates of A:x-coordinate: O1_x + r1 * cos(122°)y-coordinate: O1_y + r1 * sin(122°)Similarly, coordinates of B:x-coordinate: O2_x + r2 * cos(37°)y-coordinate: O2_y + r2 * sin(37°)Given that O1 is (-r1, 0) and O2 is (r2, 0), we can write:A = (-r1 + r1 * cos(122°), 0 + r1 * sin(122°))B = (r2 + r2 * cos(37°), 0 + r2 * sin(37°))Simplify:A = ( -r1(1 - cos(122°)), r1 sin(122°) )B = ( r2(1 + cos(37°)), r2 sin(37°) )Now, PA is tangent to semicircle SAR at A, so the line PA is perpendicular to O1A. Similarly, PB is tangent to semicircle RBT at B, so PB is perpendicular to O2B.Therefore, the slope of PA is perpendicular to the slope of O1A, and the slope of PB is perpendicular to the slope of O2B.Let me compute the slope of O1A first.Coordinates of O1: (-r1, 0)Coordinates of A: ( -r1(1 - cos(122°)), r1 sin(122°) )So, the vector O1A is:Δx = -r1(1 - cos(122°)) - (-r1) = -r1 + r1 cos(122°) + r1 = r1 cos(122°)Δy = r1 sin(122°) - 0 = r1 sin(122°)Therefore, the slope of O1A is (Δy)/(Δx) = (r1 sin(122°))/(r1 cos(122°)) = tan(122°)Since PA is perpendicular to O1A, the slope of PA is the negative reciprocal of tan(122°), which is -cot(122°)Similarly, let's compute the slope of O2B.Coordinates of O2: (r2, 0)Coordinates of B: ( r2(1 + cos(37°)), r2 sin(37°) )Vector O2B is:Δx = r2(1 + cos(37°)) - r2 = r2 cos(37°)Δy = r2 sin(37°) - 0 = r2 sin(37°)Slope of O2B is (Δy)/(Δx) = (r2 sin(37°))/(r2 cos(37°)) = tan(37°)Therefore, the slope of PB is the negative reciprocal, which is -cot(37°)Now, since we have the slopes of PA and PB, and we know points A and B, we can find the equations of lines PA and PB, then find their intersection point P.Once we have P, we can compute the angle APB.Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without getting into coordinate geometry.Wait, let me think about the angles involved.Since PA is tangent to the first semicircle, and PB is tangent to the second, and we know the arcs AS and BT, maybe we can relate these arcs to angles at point P.In circle theorems, the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, the angle between tangent PA and chord AS is equal to the angle that AS makes with the alternate segment.Wait, but in this case, the chord would be AS, but since it's a semicircle, the alternate segment is the rest of the semicircle.But maybe that's complicating things.Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the angles at P.Let me denote some variables.Let’s denote the centers O1 and O2.We know that O1A is perpendicular to PA, and O2B is perpendicular to PB.Therefore, quadrilateral O1APO2B has two right angles at A and B.Wait, but it's not necessarily a quadrilateral unless P is connected to both O1 and O2. Hmm, maybe not directly helpful.Alternatively, perhaps we can consider triangles PAO1 and PBO2.Both are right-angled triangles.In triangle PAO1, we have:- Right angle at A.- O1A = r1 (radius)- PA is tangent, so PA^2 = PO1^2 - r1^2 (by Pythagoras)Similarly, in triangle PBO2:- Right angle at B.- O2B = r2 (radius)- PB^2 = PO2^2 - r2^2But without knowing the distances PO1 and PO2, it's hard to proceed.Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that points A, P, B are colinear in some way, but I don't think so.Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that the angle APB is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.But in this case, the two arcs are on different circles, so I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe we can relate the angles at P to the angles at the centers.Wait, let me think about the angles at O1 and O2.We know the central angles for arcs AS and BT.Arc AS is 58°, so central angle ∠AO1S = 58°, and arc BT is 37°, so central angle ∠BO2T = 37°.Since SRT is a straight line, the distance between O1 and O2 is O1O2 = O1R + RO2 = r1 + r2.Wait, in the Asymptote code, r1 is 1 and r2 is 0.8, so O1O2 is 1 + 0.8 = 1.8.But maybe I can assign specific values to r1 and r2 to make calculations easier.Let me assume r1 = 1 and r2 = 0.8 as in the Asymptote code. So, O1 is at (-1, 0), O2 is at (0.8, 0). Then, S is at (-2, 0), R is at (0,0), T is at (1.6, 0).Point A is on semicircle SAR, 58° from S. So, in polar coordinates from O1, point A is at angle 180° - 58° = 122°.Therefore, coordinates of A:x = O1_x + r1 * cos(122°) = -1 + 1 * cos(122°)y = O1_y + r1 * sin(122°) = 0 + 1 * sin(122°)Similarly, point B is on semicircle RBT, 37° from T. So, in polar coordinates from O2, point B is at angle 37°.Coordinates of B:x = O2_x + r2 * cos(37°) = 0.8 + 0.8 * cos(37°)y = O2_y + r2 * sin(37°) = 0 + 0.8 * sin(37°)Let me compute these coordinates numerically.First, compute cos(122°) and sin(122°):122° is in the second quadrant.cos(122°) = cos(180° - 58°) = -cos(58°) ≈ -0.5299sin(122°) = sin(180° - 58°) = sin(58°) ≈ 0.8480Therefore, coordinates of A:x = -1 + (-0.5299) ≈ -1.5299y = 0 + 0.8480 ≈ 0.8480Similarly, compute cos(37°) and sin(37°):cos(37°) ≈ 0.7986sin(37°) ≈ 0.6018Coordinates of B:x = 0.8 + 0.8 * 0.7986 ≈ 0.8 + 0.6389 ≈ 1.4389y = 0 + 0.8 * 0.6018 ≈ 0.4814So, A ≈ (-1.5299, 0.8480)B ≈ (1.4389, 0.4814)Now, we need to find point P, which is the intersection of the two tangents PA and PB.Since PA is tangent to the first semicircle at A, and PB is tangent to the second semicircle at B.We can find the equations of PA and PB by using the fact that they are perpendicular to the radii O1A and O2B, respectively.First, let's find the slope of PA.Slope of O1A: from O1(-1,0) to A(-1.5299, 0.8480)Δx = -1.5299 - (-1) = -0.5299Δy = 0.8480 - 0 = 0.8480Slope of O1A = Δy / Δx ≈ 0.8480 / (-0.5299) ≈ -1.599Therefore, the slope of PA, being perpendicular, is the negative reciprocal: 1 / 1.599 ≈ 0.625Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.Slope of O1A: m1 = (0.8480) / (-0.5299) ≈ -1.599Therefore, slope of PA is m_PA = -1 / m1 ≈ -1 / (-1.599) ≈ 0.625Similarly, slope of O2B: from O2(0.8,0) to B(1.4389, 0.4814)Δx = 1.4389 - 0.8 ≈ 0.6389Δy = 0.4814 - 0 ≈ 0.4814Slope of O2B = Δy / Δx ≈ 0.4814 / 0.6389 ≈ 0.752Therefore, slope of PB, being perpendicular, is m_PB = -1 / 0.752 ≈ -1.33Wait, let me compute it more accurately.Slope of O2B: m2 ≈ 0.4814 / 0.6389 ≈ 0.752Therefore, slope of PB is m_PB = -1 / 0.752 ≈ -1.33Now, we have the slopes of PA and PB, and points A and B. So, we can write the equations of PA and PB.Equation of PA:Point A is (-1.5299, 0.8480), slope ≈ 0.625Using point-slope form: y - 0.8480 = 0.625(x + 1.5299)Similarly, equation of PB:Point B is (1.4389, 0.4814), slope ≈ -1.33Using point-slope form: y - 0.4814 = -1.33(x - 1.4389)Now, let's solve these two equations to find point P.First, write both equations in slope-intercept form.Equation of PA:y = 0.625x + 0.625*1.5299 + 0.8480Compute 0.625 * 1.5299 ≈ 0.625 * 1.53 ≈ 0.95625So, y ≈ 0.625x + 0.95625 + 0.8480 ≈ 0.625x + 1.80425Equation of PB:y = -1.33x + 1.33*1.4389 + 0.4814Compute 1.33 * 1.4389 ≈ 1.33 * 1.44 ≈ 1.9152So, y ≈ -1.33x + 1.9152 + 0.4814 ≈ -1.33x + 2.3966Now, set the two equations equal to find x:0.625x + 1.80425 = -1.33x + 2.3966Bring all terms to left:0.625x + 1.33x + 1.80425 - 2.3966 = 0(0.625 + 1.33)x + (1.80425 - 2.3966) = 01.955x - 0.59235 ≈ 01.955x ≈ 0.59235x ≈ 0.59235 / 1.955 ≈ 0.303Now, plug x ≈ 0.303 into equation of PA to find y:y ≈ 0.625*(0.303) + 1.80425 ≈ 0.189375 + 1.80425 ≈ 1.9936So, point P is approximately at (0.303, 1.9936)Now, we have coordinates of A, B, and P.Coordinates:A ≈ (-1.5299, 0.8480)B ≈ (1.4389, 0.4814)P ≈ (0.303, 1.9936)Now, we need to find angle APB.To find angle APB, we can use vector analysis or coordinate geometry.First, compute vectors PA and PB.Vector PA = A - P ≈ (-1.5299 - 0.303, 0.8480 - 1.9936) ≈ (-1.8329, -1.1456)Vector PB = B - P ≈ (1.4389 - 0.303, 0.4814 - 1.9936) ≈ (1.1359, -1.5122)Now, the angle between vectors PA and PB can be found using the dot product formula:cosθ = (PA • PB) / (|PA| |PB|)Compute the dot product:PA • PB ≈ (-1.8329)(1.1359) + (-1.1456)(-1.5122) ≈ (-2.083) + (1.732) ≈ -0.351Compute |PA|:|PA| ≈ sqrt((-1.8329)^2 + (-1.1456)^2) ≈ sqrt(3.359 + 1.313) ≈ sqrt(4.672) ≈ 2.161Compute |PB|:|PB| ≈ sqrt((1.1359)^2 + (-1.5122)^2) ≈ sqrt(1.290 + 2.286) ≈ sqrt(3.576) ≈ 1.891Now, compute cosθ:cosθ ≈ (-0.351) / (2.161 * 1.891) ≈ (-0.351) / (4.083) ≈ -0.0859Therefore, θ ≈ arccos(-0.0859) ≈ 95 degreesWait, arccos(-0.0859) is approximately 95 degrees? Let me check.cos(90°) = 0cos(180°) = -1cos(95°) ≈ -0.08716Yes, that's very close. So, θ ≈ 95 degrees.But wait, in the Asymptote code, the radii are 1 and 0.8, but in reality, the radii could be different. Did I make an assumption about the radii? Yes, I took r1 = 1 and r2 = 0.8 as per the Asymptote code. But in the problem statement, the radii aren't given, so maybe the answer is general.But in my calculation, I got approximately 95 degrees, but let me see if it's exactly 95.Wait, 58 + 37 = 95. Hmm, interesting. So, is angle APB equal to the sum of arcs AS and BT?But in my calculation, it came out as approximately 95°, which is exactly 58 + 37.Is that a coincidence?Wait, let me think again.In circle theorems, the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.But in this case, the two arcs are on different circles, so that theorem doesn't directly apply.But in my calculation, the angle came out as the sum of the two arcs. Maybe in this specific configuration, it's the sum.Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum because the two semicircles are on the same line SRT, and the external point P is above them, so the angle APB is the sum of the two angles made by the tangents.Wait, let me consider the angles at P.From point P, the tangent PA makes an angle with the horizontal, and tangent PB makes another angle. The angle between PA and PB would be the difference between these two angles.But in my coordinate system, PA has a positive slope, and PB has a negative slope, so the angle between them is the sum of their angles with the horizontal.Wait, let me compute the angles of PA and PB with the horizontal.Slope of PA is approximately 0.625, so angle α = arctan(0.625) ≈ 32°Slope of PB is approximately -1.33, so angle β = arctan(1.33) ≈ 53°, but since it's negative, it's 180° - 53° = 127° from the positive x-axis.Therefore, the angle between PA and PB is 127° - 32° = 95°, which matches my previous calculation.So, angle APB is 95°, which is exactly the sum of arcs AS (58°) and BT (37°).Therefore, the measure of angle APB is 58° + 37° = 95°.Hence, the answer is 95 degrees.**Final Answer**boxed{95}"},{"question":"(1) Calculate: left(-2right)^{3}div left(-2right)^{2}times {(frac{1}{2})}^{0};  (2) Calculate using polynomial multiplication formula: 199times 201+1.","answer":"First, I'll tackle the first problem: ((-2)^3 div (-2)^2 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^0).I know that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so (left(frac{1}{2}right)^0 = 1). Next, I'll calculate the exponents: ((-2)^3 = -8) and ((-2)^2 = 4). Now, the expression simplifies to (-8 div 4 times 1). Dividing (-8) by (4) gives (-2), and multiplying by (1) leaves the result as (-2).Moving on to the second problem: (199 times 201 + 1).I recognize that (199) and (201) are close to (200), so I can express them as (200 - 1) and (200 + 1) respectively. This allows me to use the difference of squares formula: ((a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2).Applying this, (199 times 201 = (200 - 1)(200 + 1) = 200^2 - 1^2 = 40000 - 1 = 39999).

Let ( x ) represent the number of koi fish in the pond.The problem states that 14 less than two times the number of koi fish is 64. This translates to the equation:[ 2x - 14 = 64 ]To solve for ( x ), I'll start by isolating the term with ( x ). I'll add 14 to both sides of the equation:[ 2x = 64 + 14 ][ 2x = 78 ]Next, I'll divide both sides by 2 to find the value of ( x ):[ x = frac{78}{2} ][ x = 39 ]Therefore, there are 39 koi fish in the pond."},{"question":"Natural number  M  has  6  divisors, such that sum of them are equal to  3500 .Find the all values of  M .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all natural numbers M that have exactly 6 divisors, and the sum of these divisors is equal to 3500. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that the number of divisors of a number relates to its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number M has a prime factorization of the form ( M = p_1^{a_1} times p_2^{a_2} times dots times p_n^{a_n} ), then the number of divisors is ( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)dots(a_n + 1) ). Since M has exactly 6 divisors, I need to figure out the possible exponents in its prime factorization that would result in 6 when applying the formula above. Let me think: 6 can be factored as 6 = 6 × 1 or 6 = 3 × 2. So, that means M can be either of the form ( p^5 ) where p is a prime number, or ( p^2 times q ) where p and q are distinct primes. Alright, so there are two cases to consider:1. ( M = p^5 )2. ( M = p^2 times q )Now, for each case, I need to find M such that the sum of its divisors is 3500. The sum of divisors function, often denoted as σ(M), can be calculated using the formula for each prime power. Starting with the first case: ( M = p^5 ). The sum of divisors for this would be ( 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 + p^4 + p^5 ). So, I need to solve the equation:( 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 + p^4 + p^5 = 3500 )Hmm, let me try plugging in some small prime numbers to see if this holds.Starting with p=2:( 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63 ). That's way too small.p=3:( 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364 ). Still too small.p=5:( 1 + 5 + 25 + 125 + 625 + 3125 = 3906 ). Oh, that's actually larger than 3500. Hmm, so p=5 gives a sum of 3906, which is more than 3500. Let me check p=7:Wait, p=7 would be even larger, so the sum would be even bigger. So, maybe p=5 is too big, p=3 is too small. There's no prime between 3 and 5, so maybe this case doesn't work. So, perhaps there is no solution in the form ( p^5 ).Moving on to the second case: ( M = p^2 times q ), where p and q are distinct primes. The sum of divisors for this would be:( (1 + p + p^2)(1 + q) = 3500 )So, I need to find primes p and q such that when I compute ( (1 + p + p^2)(1 + q) ), it equals 3500.Let me denote ( A = 1 + p + p^2 ) and ( B = 1 + q ), so that A × B = 3500. Therefore, A and B must be divisors of 3500.First, let me factorize 3500 to find all possible pairs (A, B). 3500 can be factored as:( 3500 = 2^2 times 5^3 times 7 )So, the divisors of 3500 can be found by taking exponents from 0 up to the exponents in the prime factors.Let me list all the divisors of 3500:Starting with 1:1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 25, 28, 35, 50, 70, 100, 125, 140, 175, 250, 350, 500, 700, 875, 1750, 3500.So, these are all the divisors. Now, since A = 1 + p + p^2 and B = 1 + q, and both A and B must be greater than 1 (since p and q are primes, so p ≥ 2, q ≥ 2, so A ≥ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, and B ≥ 3). So, A must be at least 7, and B must be at least 3.Therefore, I can look for pairs (A, B) where A is a divisor of 3500, A ≥ 7, B is a divisor of 3500, B ≥ 3, and A × B = 3500.Let me list all possible pairs:Starting with A=7, then B=3500/7=500. Check if B-1=499 is prime. 499 is a prime number.So, A=7, B=500. Then, 1 + p + p^2 =7, so p^2 + p +1=7. Let's solve for p:p^2 + p +1 =7p^2 + p -6=0Solutions: p = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +24)] /2 = [-1 ±5]/2So, p=(4)/2=2 or p=(-6)/2=-3. Since p is prime, p=2.So, p=2, q=B-1=500-1=499, which is prime. So, M = p^2 × q = 4 × 499 = 1996. Let me check the number of divisors: exponents are 2 and 1, so (2+1)(1+1)=6, which is correct. Sum of divisors: (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 499)=7×500=3500. Perfect.Next, A=10, B=3500/10=350. Check if B-1=349 is prime. 349 is a prime.So, A=10, B=350. Then, 1 + p + p^2=10. Let's solve:p^2 + p +1=10p^2 + p -9=0Discriminant: 1 +36=37. sqrt(37) is irrational, so p is not integer. So, no solution here.Next, A=14, B=3500/14=250. Check if B-1=249 is prime. 249 is divisible by 3 (2+4+9=15, which is divisible by 3), so 249=3×83. Not prime.So, discard A=14.Next, A=20, B=3500/20=175. Check if B-1=174 is prime. 174 is even, so no.A=25, B=3500/25=140. B-1=139, which is prime.So, A=25, B=140. Then, 1 + p + p^2=25.Solving p^2 + p +1=25p^2 + p -24=0Discriminant: 1 +96=97. sqrt(97) is irrational, so no integer solution. So, discard.A=28, B=3500/28=125. B-1=124, which is even, not prime.A=35, B=3500/35=100. B-1=99, which is divisible by 3, not prime.A=50, B=3500/50=70. B-1=69, which is divisible by 3, not prime.A=70, B=3500/70=50. B-1=49, which is 7^2, not prime.A=100, B=3500/100=35. B-1=34, which is even, not prime.A=125, B=3500/125=28. B-1=27, which is 3^3, not prime.A=140, B=3500/140=25. B-1=24, which is not prime.A=175, B=3500/175=20. B-1=19, which is prime.So, A=175, B=20. Then, 1 + p + p^2=175.Solving p^2 + p +1=175p^2 + p -174=0Discriminant: 1 + 696=697. Hmm, sqrt(697) is approximately 26.4, not integer. So, no solution.A=250, B=3500/250=14. B-1=13, which is prime.So, A=250, B=14. Then, 1 + p + p^2=250.Solving p^2 + p +1=250p^2 + p -249=0Discriminant: 1 + 996=997. sqrt(997) is irrational, so no solution.A=350, B=3500/350=10. B-1=9, which is not prime.A=500, B=3500/500=7. B-1=6, which is not prime.A=700, B=3500/700=5. B-1=4, not prime.A=875, B=3500/875=4. B-1=3, which is prime.So, A=875, B=4. Then, 1 + p + p^2=875.Solving p^2 + p +1=875p^2 + p -874=0Discriminant: 1 + 3496=3497. Hmm, sqrt(3497) is approximately 59.13, not integer. So, no solution.A=1750, B=3500/1750=2. B-1=1, which is not prime.A=3500, B=3500/3500=1. B-1=0, which is not prime.So, the only valid pair is A=7, B=500, which gives p=2 and q=499, so M=2²×499=4×499=1996.Wait, but let me check if there are any other possible pairs where A and B are swapped? For example, if A=500 and B=7, but then A=500 would imply 1 + p + p^2=500, which would lead to p^2 + p -499=0. The discriminant is 1 + 1996=1997, which is prime, so sqrt(1997) is irrational, so no solution. Similarly, other pairs where A is larger than B would not yield integer p.Therefore, the only solution in the second case is M=1996.Wait, but earlier I thought that the first case, M=p^5, didn't yield any solution because p=5 gives a sum of 3906, which is more than 3500, and p=3 gives 364, which is too small. So, maybe there's no solution in the first case, only in the second case.But just to be thorough, let me check p=2 in the first case: sum is 63, which is way too small. p=3: 364, still too small. p=5: 3906, too big. So, no solution in the first case.Therefore, the only M is 1996.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for A=7, B=500. So, p=2, q=499. Then, M=4×499=1996. The divisors of 1996 are: 1, 2, 4, 499, 998, 1996. Sum is 1+2+4+499+998+1996. Let's compute:1+2=3, 3+4=7, 7+499=506, 506+998=1504, 1504+1996=3500. Perfect.So, yes, that works. Any other possibilities? I don't think so because in the second case, only A=7 and B=500 worked, and in the first case, nothing worked.Therefore, the only natural number M with exactly 6 divisors whose sum is 3500 is 1996.**Final Answer**The natural number ( M ) is boxed{1996}."},{"question":"In triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively, and they satisfy (2a-c)cos B=bcos C.(I) Find the measure of angle B;(II) Let overrightarrow{m}=(sin A,1), overrightarrow{n}=(-1,1), find the minimum value of overrightarrow{m}cdot overrightarrow{n}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about triangle ABC. The sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, c respectively. The condition given is (2a - c)cos B = b cos C. I need to find the measure of angle B for part (I), and for part (II), I have vectors m and n defined as (sin A, 1) and (-1, 1) respectively, and I need to find the minimum value of their dot product.Starting with part (I). Hmm, okay, so in triangle ABC, the sides and angles are related by the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines. Maybe I can use those to manipulate the given equation.Given: (2a - c)cos B = b cos C.I know that in any triangle, the Law of Cosines relates the sides and one angle. Specifically, cos B = (a² + c² - b²)/(2ac) and cos C = (a² + b² - c²)/(2ab). Maybe I can substitute these into the equation.Let me write that down:(2a - c) * [(a² + c² - b²)/(2ac)] = b * [(a² + b² - c²)/(2ab)]Simplify both sides:Left side: (2a - c)(a² + c² - b²)/(2ac)Right side: b(a² + b² - c²)/(2ab) = (a² + b² - c²)/(2a)So, left side: [(2a - c)(a² + c² - b²)]/(2ac) = right side: (a² + b² - c²)/(2a)Multiply both sides by 2ac to eliminate denominators:(2a - c)(a² + c² - b²) = c(a² + b² - c²)Let me expand the left side:(2a)(a² + c² - b²) - c(a² + c² - b²) = c(a² + b² - c²)Compute each term:First term: 2a(a²) + 2a(c²) - 2a(b²) = 2a³ + 2a c² - 2a b²Second term: -c(a²) - c(c²) + c(b²) = -a² c - c³ + b² cSo, combining these:2a³ + 2a c² - 2a b² - a² c - c³ + b² c = c(a² + b² - c²)Let me write the right side:c(a² + b² - c²) = a² c + b² c - c³So, putting it all together:Left side: 2a³ + 2a c² - 2a b² - a² c - c³ + b² cRight side: a² c + b² c - c³Subtract right side from both sides:2a³ + 2a c² - 2a b² - a² c - c³ + b² c - (a² c + b² c - c³) = 0Simplify term by term:2a³ + 2a c² - 2a b² - a² c - c³ + b² c - a² c - b² c + c³ = 0Now, let's cancel like terms:- c³ + c³ cancels out.b² c - b² c cancels out.- a² c - a² c becomes -2a² c.So, remaining terms:2a³ + 2a c² - 2a b² - 2a² c = 0Factor out 2a:2a(a² + c² - b² - a c) = 0Since 2a is not zero (a is a side length, so it's positive), we have:a² + c² - b² - a c = 0So, a² + c² - b² = a cWait, from the Law of Cosines, a² + c² - b² = 2ac cos B.So, 2ac cos B = a cDivide both sides by ac (since a and c are positive, we can do this):2 cos B = 1So, cos B = 1/2Therefore, angle B is arccos(1/2), which is 60 degrees or π/3 radians.So, part (I) is 60 degrees.Moving on to part (II). We have vectors m = (sin A, 1) and n = (-1, 1). We need to find the minimum value of their dot product.First, let's compute the dot product:m · n = (sin A)(-1) + (1)(1) = -sin A + 1So, m · n = 1 - sin AWe need to find the minimum value of this expression. Since sin A varies between -1 and 1, 1 - sin A will vary between 0 and 2. So, the minimum value would be 0, achieved when sin A = 1, which is when A = 90 degrees.But wait, hold on. In triangle ABC, angle A is one of the angles, and we already found that angle B is 60 degrees. So, the triangle has angles A, 60 degrees, and C, which must add up to 180 degrees. So, A + C = 120 degrees. Therefore, angle A can't be 90 degrees unless angle C is 30 degrees. But is that possible?Wait, but in the given condition, is there any restriction on angle A? Or is it just any triangle with angle B = 60 degrees?Wait, in part (I), we found angle B is 60 degrees, but in part (II), is the triangle still under the same condition? The problem says \\"Let vectors m and n...\\", so I think part (II) is still within the context of triangle ABC with angle B = 60 degrees.So, in triangle ABC, angle B is 60 degrees, so angles A and C sum to 120 degrees. So, angle A can vary between greater than 0 and less than 120 degrees.Therefore, sin A can vary between sin(0) = 0 and sin(90) = 1, but since angle A can go up to 120 degrees, sin(120) is √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So, sin A can go up to √3/2, but cannot reach 1 because angle A can't reach 90 degrees if angle C is also positive.Wait, no, actually, if angle A is 90 degrees, then angle C would be 30 degrees, which is allowed because all angles would be positive. So, angle A can be 90 degrees, making angle C 30 degrees, so sin A can indeed reach 1.Wait, but if angle A is 90 degrees, then side a would be the hypotenuse, so a would be the longest side. Let's see if that's consistent with the given condition in part (I).Wait, in part (I), we had (2a - c)cos B = b cos C. If angle A is 90 degrees, then angle C is 30 degrees, angle B is 60 degrees.So, let's check if that satisfies the condition.In a triangle with angles 90, 60, 30, sides are in the ratio 2 : √3 : 1, with the side opposite 90 degrees being the longest.So, let me denote sides:a is opposite angle A, which is 90 degrees, so a = 2k.b is opposite angle B, which is 60 degrees, so b = √3 k.c is opposite angle C, which is 30 degrees, so c = k.So, plugging into the given condition:(2a - c)cos B = (2*2k - k)cos 60 = (4k - k)*(1/2) = 3k*(1/2) = (3k)/2On the other side, b cos C = √3 k * cos 30 = √3 k*(√3/2) = (3k)/2So, both sides are equal, so yes, when angle A is 90 degrees, the condition is satisfied.Therefore, angle A can indeed be 90 degrees, so sin A can reach 1, making m · n = 1 - 1 = 0.But wait, is 0 the minimum? Because 1 - sin A is minimized when sin A is maximized, which is 1, so 0 is the minimum.But hold on, let me think again. If angle A is 90 degrees, then sin A is 1, so m · n is 0. If angle A is smaller, say 30 degrees, sin A is 0.5, so m · n is 0.5. If angle A is larger, say 120 degrees, sin 120 is √3/2 ≈ 0.866, so m · n is 1 - √3/2 ≈ 0.134.Wait, so when angle A is 120 degrees, m · n is approximately 0.134, which is less than when angle A is 90 degrees (which is 0). Wait, but 0.134 is greater than 0, so 0 is still the minimum.Wait, but if angle A is 120 degrees, sin A is √3/2, so 1 - √3/2 ≈ 0.134, which is higher than 0. So, 0 is indeed the minimum.But hold on, can angle A be 270 degrees? No, because in a triangle, all angles are less than 180, and angle A is less than 120 degrees since angle B is 60.Wait, but angle A can be between 0 and 120 degrees, so sin A can be between 0 and 1, with the maximum at 90 degrees.Wait, but in reality, angle A can be from just above 0 to 120 degrees, so sin A can be from just above 0 to sin 120, which is √3/2 ≈ 0.866.Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier thought. If angle A is 90 degrees, then angle C is 30 degrees, which is allowed. So, sin A can be 1. So, actually, sin A can go up to 1.Wait, perhaps I was confused earlier. So, sin A can be from 0 to 1, but in this triangle, angle A can be up to 90 degrees, but wait, if angle A is more than 90 degrees, say 100 degrees, then angle C would be 20 degrees, which is still allowed. So, sin A can go up to sin 90 = 1, but beyond 90 degrees, sin A starts decreasing.Wait, no, sin 100 degrees is sin(80 degrees) ≈ 0.9848, which is less than sin 90 degrees. So, the maximum of sin A is at 90 degrees, which is 1.Therefore, in this triangle, sin A can vary from sin(0) = 0 (but angle A can't be 0) up to sin(90) = 1, and then decreases again as angle A approaches 120 degrees, where sin 120 ≈ 0.866.So, the maximum value of sin A is 1, and the minimum is approaching 0 as angle A approaches 0. So, 1 - sin A can vary from 0 (when sin A = 1) up to 1 (when sin A approaches 0). Wait, no, if sin A approaches 0, then 1 - sin A approaches 1. So, the expression 1 - sin A has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.But wait, in our case, angle A can't be 0, so 1 - sin A can't actually reach 1. It can approach 1 as angle A approaches 0, but never actually gets there. Similarly, 1 - sin A can reach 0 when angle A is 90 degrees.Therefore, the minimum value of m · n is 0, achieved when angle A is 90 degrees.But wait, let me think again. If angle A is 90 degrees, then angle C is 30 degrees, and sides are in the ratio 2 : √3 : 1. So, in this case, does the given condition hold? Earlier, when I checked, it did hold. So, yes, angle A can be 90 degrees, so sin A can be 1, making the dot product 0.Therefore, the minimum value is 0.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure that angle A can indeed be 90 degrees. Since angle B is 60 degrees, angle A can be 90 degrees, making angle C 30 degrees. So, the triangle is valid. So, yes, sin A can be 1, so the minimum is 0.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using calculus or another method.Given that m · n = 1 - sin A, and we need to find its minimum. Since sin A has a maximum of 1, the minimum of 1 - sin A is 0. So, regardless of the triangle, as long as angle A can reach 90 degrees, which it can in this case, the minimum is 0.Therefore, the minimum value is 0.Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using vectors or trigonometric identities.Alternatively, since m · n = 1 - sin A, and we need to find its minimum. Since sin A can be at most 1, so 1 - sin A is at least 0. So, 0 is the minimum.Therefore, the minimum value is 0.So, summarizing:(I) Angle B is 60 degrees.(II) The minimum value of m · n is 0.**Final Answer**(I) The measure of angle ( B ) is (boxed{60^circ}).(II) The minimum value of ( overrightarrow{m} cdot overrightarrow{n} ) is (boxed{0})."},{"question":"The number of integer solutions for the inequality ( |x| < 3 pi ) is ( ).(A) 9  (B) 10  (C) 18  (D) 19  (E) 20  ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"The number of integer solutions for the inequality ( |x| < 3 pi ) is ( ).\\" The options are (A) 9, (B) 10, (C) 18, (D) 19, (E) 20. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that ( |x| < a ) means that x is between -a and a, not including a. So in this case, ( |x| < 3pi ) translates to ( -3pi < x < 3pi ). Now, since we're dealing with integer solutions, x has to be an integer within that range.I should figure out what 3π is approximately equal to because π is about 3.1416, right? So multiplying that by 3 gives me roughly 9.4248. So, ( 3pi ) is approximately 9.4248. That means the inequality ( |x| < 9.4248 ) is the same as ( -9.4248 < x < 9.4248 ).Since x has to be an integer, I need to find all integers between -9.4248 and 9.4248. But wait, integers are whole numbers, so the smallest integer greater than -9.4248 is -9, and the largest integer less than 9.4248 is 9. So, x can be any integer from -9 up to 9.Now, how many integers are there from -9 to 9 inclusive? Let me count them. Starting from -9, -8, -7, ..., all the way up to 0, and then 1, 2, ..., up to 9. Hmm, so from -9 to 9, that's 19 numbers because we include both endpoints.Wait, let me make sure. If I count from -9 to 0, that's 10 numbers (including 0), and from 1 to 9, that's another 9 numbers. So 10 + 9 = 19. Yeah, that makes sense.But hold on, the inequality is strict, meaning x has to be less than 9.4248 and greater than -9.4248. So, does that include 9 or -9? Since 9 is less than 9.4248, yes, 9 is included. Similarly, -9 is greater than -9.4248, so it's also included. So, both -9 and 9 are part of the solution set.Therefore, the total number of integer solutions is 19. Looking back at the options, (D) is 19. So, I think that's the answer.But just to double-check, let me list out the integers from -9 to 9:Negative integers: -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1 (that's 9 numbers)Zero: 0 (1 number)Positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (another 9 numbers)Adding them up: 9 + 1 + 9 = 19. Yep, that's correct.I think I might have confused myself earlier if I considered whether 0 was included or not, but since 0 is between -9.4248 and 9.4248, it is included. So, all 19 integers are valid solutions.Another way to think about it is that the number of integers between -n and n exclusive is 2n - 1, but in this case, since n is approximately 9.4248, which is not an integer, we have to take the floor of n, which is 9, and then the number of integers is 2*9 + 1 = 19. That formula works because from -9 to 9, you have 9 negative integers, 9 positive integers, and 0, totaling 19.So, yeah, that solidifies my answer as (D) 19.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"The school store is running out of supplies, but it still has five items: one pencil (costing   1 ), one pen (costing   1 ), one folder (costing   2 ), one pack of paper (costing   3 ), and one binder (costing   4 ).

(The numbers 152 and 553 are two natural numbers that contain the digit 5 at least once, but 430 is not.)","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many numbers from 1 to 600 inclusive have the digit 5 at least once. Hmm, let's see. I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of numbers without the digit 5 and then subtract that from the total number of numbers. That way, I can find how many do have at least one 5. Yeah, that sounds like a plan.First, let's figure out the total number of numbers we're dealing with. From 1 to 600 inclusive, that's 600 numbers. So, total numbers = 600.Now, I need to find how many numbers don't have the digit 5 at all. Then, subtract that count from 600 to get the numbers that do have at least one 5. Cool.To find the numbers without any 5s, I should consider each digit place separately. Let's break it down into units, tens, and hundreds place.But wait, numbers from 1 to 600 can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Maybe it's better to consider all numbers as 3-digit by padding with leading zeros. So, numbers from 001 to 600. That might make it easier to handle each digit place uniformly.But actually, when considering numbers from 1 to 600, the hundreds place can be 0 (for numbers less than 100), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Wait, but 600 is included, so the hundreds place can go up to 6. Hmm, but 600 is a special case because it's exactly 600, which is 6-0-0.But maybe I should treat all numbers as 3-digit numbers, so from 000 to 599 and then 600. Wait, 000 isn't included because we're starting from 1, so maybe it's better to handle 1 to 599 and then add 600 separately.Wait, 600 is a 3-digit number, so maybe I can handle it as part of the 3-digit numbers. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I can separate the numbers into ranges:1-99, 100-599, and 600. Then calculate the numbers without any 5s in each range and add them up.But perhaps a better approach is to think of all numbers as 3-digit numbers, so from 000 to 599, and then 600. Then, calculate the numbers without any 5s in 000-599, subtract the 000 if necessary, and then check if 600 contains a 5.Wait, 600 doesn't contain a 5, so if I include it in the count of numbers without 5s, I need to remember to add it back later. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.Maybe let's stick with the original idea: calculate the total numbers without any 5s from 1 to 600, then subtract that from 600.To calculate numbers without any 5s, we can consider each digit place:- Units place: can be 0-9 except 5, so 9 choices.- Tens place: same, 9 choices.- Hundreds place: 0-6 except 5, but wait, for numbers less than 100, the hundreds place is 0, which is allowed. So, for hundreds place, it can be 0,1,2,3,4,6. So that's 6 choices.Wait, hold on. If we consider numbers from 000 to 599, the hundreds place can be 0-5, but since we're excluding 5, it's 0-4 and 6? Wait, no, 600 is a separate case.Wait, maybe I need to adjust my approach.Let me think of numbers from 000 to 599 as 3-digit numbers, where each digit can be 0-9 except 5. Then, the count would be 6 (hundreds) * 9 (tens) * 9 (units). But wait, 000 isn't included in our original range, so we need to subtract 1 if necessary.But actually, numbers from 1 to 599 can be considered as 001 to 599, so maybe the count without any 5s is 6*9*9 - 1 (for 000). Hmm, but 000 isn't in our range, so maybe it's okay.Wait, maybe it's better to calculate separately for 1-99, 100-599, and 600.Starting with 1-99:Numbers without any 5s:- Units place: 0-9 except 5: 9 choices.- Tens place: 0-9 except 5: 9 choices.But wait, for numbers 1-99, the tens place can be 0-9 except 5, but for numbers 1-9, the tens place is 0. So, actually, numbers from 1-99 without any 5s:- For 1-9: units digit can't be 5, so 8 numbers (since 5 is excluded).- For 10-99: tens digit can't be 5, so 8 choices (0-9 except 5), and units digit can't be 5, so 9 choices. So, 8*9 = 72.Wait, hold on. For 10-99, the tens digit can be 0-9 except 5, which is 9 choices, but actually, the tens digit can't be 0 because we're in the 10-99 range. Wait, no, 10-99 includes numbers like 10, 20, ..., 90, so the tens digit can be 1-9 except 5, which is 8 choices. And the units digit can be 0-9 except 5, which is 9 choices. So, 8*9 = 72.And for 1-9, units digit can't be 5, so 8 numbers.So total numbers without any 5s from 1-99: 8 + 72 = 80.Wait, but 10-99: tens digit can be 1-9 except 5, which is 8, and units digit 0-9 except 5, which is 9, so 8*9=72. Then 1-9: 8 numbers. So total 80. That seems right.Now, moving on to 100-599:Numbers without any 5s.- Hundreds place: can be 1-5 except 5, so 1,2,3,4. So 4 choices.- Tens place: 0-9 except 5: 9 choices.- Units place: 0-9 except 5: 9 choices.So, 4*9*9 = 324.Wait, but 100-599 is 500 numbers, right? From 100 to 599 inclusive, that's 500 numbers.But wait, 100-599 is 500 numbers, but if we calculate numbers without any 5s as 4*9*9=324, that seems correct.Wait, 4 choices for hundreds place (1-4), 9 for tens, 9 for units. 4*9*9=324.So, numbers without any 5s from 100-599: 324.Now, what about 600? 600 is a single number, and it doesn't contain a 5, so it's 1 number without any 5s.So, total numbers without any 5s from 1-600: numbers without 5s from 1-99 (80) + numbers without 5s from 100-599 (324) + 600 (1) = 80 + 324 + 1 = 405.Wait, but hold on. When we considered 1-99, we included numbers from 1-99, which is correct. Then 100-599 is 500 numbers, and 600 is 1 number. So total numbers considered: 99 + 500 +1=600. That's correct.So, numbers without any 5s: 80 + 324 +1=405.Therefore, numbers with at least one 5: total numbers (600) - numbers without any 5s (405) = 195.Wait, so the answer is 195.But let me verify this because sometimes when I break it down, I might have missed something.Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the number of numbers with at least one 5 by considering each digit place.But that might be more complicated because of overlapping cases (numbers with multiple 5s). So, inclusion-exclusion principle might be needed.But since the first method gave me 195, let me see if that makes sense.Wait, another way: for numbers from 1 to 600, how many have at least one 5.We can calculate it as:Total numbers - numbers without any 5s.Which is 600 - 405 = 195.Alternatively, let's think about how many numbers have 5 in units place, 5 in tens place, or 5 in hundreds place.But we have to be careful about overlapping, where a number might have 5 in more than one digit.So, using inclusion-exclusion:Number with at least one 5 = (numbers with 5 in units) + (numbers with 5 in tens) + (numbers with 5 in hundreds) - (numbers with 5 in both units and tens) - (numbers with 5 in units and hundreds) - (numbers with 5 in tens and hundreds) + (numbers with 5 in all three digits).So, let's compute each part.First, numbers with 5 in units place:From 1 to 600, how many numbers end with 5.Every 10 numbers have one such number: 5,15,25,...,595.From 1 to 600, how many? 600 /10 =60. So, 60 numbers.Similarly, numbers with 5 in tens place:Numbers where the tens digit is 5: 50-59, 150-159, ..., 550-559.Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 5. From 1-600, there are 6 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, ..., 500-599, 600). But 600 doesn't have a tens digit. So, 6 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 6*10=60. But wait, 600 is a separate case, but it doesn't have a tens digit of 5, so total is 60.Wait, but actually, in 0-99, 50-59 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199:150-159, etc., up to 500-599:550-559. So, 6 sets of 10, so 60 numbers.Similarly, numbers with 5 in hundreds place:Numbers from 500-599. That's 100 numbers.So, numbers with 5 in hundreds place: 100.Now, numbers with 5 in both units and tens place:These are numbers where both units and tens digits are 5. So, numbers like 55, 155, 255, ..., 555.How many are there? From 0-999, it's every 100 numbers: 55,155,255,355,455,555. So, 6 numbers. But since we're only going up to 600, 555 is included, so 6 numbers.Similarly, numbers with 5 in units and hundreds place:These are numbers where units digit is 5 and hundreds digit is 5. So, numbers like 505,515,...,595.From 500-599, how many numbers end with 5? Every 10 numbers, so 10 numbers: 505,515,...,595.So, 10 numbers.Similarly, numbers with 5 in tens and hundreds place:Numbers where tens digit is 5 and hundreds digit is 5. So, numbers from 550-559. That's 10 numbers.Finally, numbers with 5 in all three digits: 555. Only one number.So, applying inclusion-exclusion:Number with at least one 5 = (60 + 60 + 100) - (6 + 10 +10) + (1)Compute:60 +60 +100 =220Subtract: 6 +10 +10=26So, 220 -26=194Add back the overlap of all three: 1So, total=194 +1=195.Okay, so that matches the previous result. So, 195 numbers from 1 to 600 contain the digit 5 at least once.Therefore, the answer is 195.**Final Answer**The number of natural numbers from 1 to 600 that contain the digit 5 at least once is boxed{195}."},{"question":"Given (z=dfrac{{(2-i)}^{2}}{i}), then (left| z right|=)__________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: given ( z = dfrac{(2 - i)^2}{i} ), I need to find the modulus of ( z ), which is ( |z| ). Hmm, modulus of a complex number, right? I remember that the modulus is like the distance from the origin in the complex plane, calculated as ( |a + bi| = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). But here, ( z ) is given as a fraction, so maybe I should simplify it first before finding the modulus. Let me write down the expression again: ( z = dfrac{(2 - i)^2}{i} ). Hmm, okay, so I have a complex number in the numerator squared, and then divided by another complex number ( i ). Maybe I should first compute ( (2 - i)^2 ) and then divide by ( i ). Alternatively, I remember that the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli, so maybe I can find the modulus of the numerator and the modulus of the denominator separately and then divide them. That might be easier because dealing with modulus often simplifies things.Let me recall the property: ( | dfrac{a}{b} | = dfrac{|a|}{|b|} ). So, if I can find ( |(2 - i)^2| ) and ( |i| ), then I can just divide them to get ( |z| ). That sounds good because squaring and taking modulus might be straightforward.First, let me compute ( |(2 - i)^2| ). I remember that ( |a^2| = |a|^2 ), so ( |(2 - i)^2| = |2 - i|^2 ). So, I just need to find ( |2 - i| ) and then square it.Calculating ( |2 - i| ): the modulus of a complex number ( a + bi ) is ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). So here, ( a = 2 ) and ( b = -1 ). Therefore, ( |2 - i| = sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5} ). So, ( |(2 - i)^2| = (sqrt{5})^2 = 5 ).Next, I need to find ( |i| ). The complex number ( i ) is ( 0 + 1i ), so ( |i| = sqrt{0^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{1} = 1 ).Therefore, ( |z| = dfrac{|(2 - i)^2|}{|i|} = dfrac{5}{1} = 5 ). So, the modulus of ( z ) is 5.Wait, but just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake, maybe I should compute ( z ) directly and then find its modulus. Let's try that approach as a verification.Starting with ( z = dfrac{(2 - i)^2}{i} ). Let me compute ( (2 - i)^2 ) first. Expanding this, ( (2 - i)^2 = (2)^2 + (-i)^2 + 2 * 2 * (-i) = 4 + i^2 - 4i ). Since ( i^2 = -1 ), this becomes ( 4 - 1 - 4i = 3 - 4i ).So, ( z = dfrac{3 - 4i}{i} ). Now, to simplify this, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. But the denominator is just ( i ), whose complex conjugate is ( -i ). So, multiplying numerator and denominator by ( -i ):( z = dfrac{(3 - 4i)(-i)}{i * (-i)} ).Let me compute the numerator: ( (3)(-i) + (-4i)(-i) = -3i + 4i^2 ). Since ( i^2 = -1 ), this becomes ( -3i + 4(-1) = -3i - 4 ). So, the numerator is ( -4 - 3i ).The denominator: ( i * (-i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1 ).Therefore, ( z = dfrac{-4 - 3i}{1} = -4 - 3i ).Now, finding the modulus of ( z ): ( |-4 - 3i| = sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-3)^2} = sqrt{16 + 9} = sqrt{25} = 5 ).Okay, so both methods give me the same result, which is 5. So, that's consistent. I think I can be confident that the modulus of ( z ) is indeed 5.Alternatively, another way to think about modulus is that it's multiplicative, so ( |z| = |(2 - i)^2| / |i| ). As I calculated earlier, ( |2 - i| = sqrt{5} ), so ( |(2 - i)^2| = 5 ), and ( |i| = 1 ), so ( |z| = 5 / 1 = 5 ). Yep, same answer.I think I've covered all the possible ways to approach this problem, and each time I get 5. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure the answer is correct.Just to recap:1. Direct computation: Expand ( (2 - i)^2 ), divide by ( i ), simplify, then compute modulus.2. Using modulus properties: Compute modulus of numerator and denominator separately, then divide.Both methods lead to the same result, so I feel confident that ( |z| = 5 ).**Final Answer**The modulus of ( z ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"A shooter at a shooting range was given the following conditions: each hit is rewarded with five tokens, but three tokens are taken away for each miss. The shooter was not very accurate. After the last (n-th) shot, he had no tokens left. How many shots did the series consist of and how many were successful if 10 < n < 20?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a shooter at a shooting range. The shooter gets five tokens for each hit, but loses three tokens for each miss. After the last shot, which is the n-th shot, he has no tokens left. I need to figure out how many shots there were in total (n) and how many were successful (let's call that h). The constraints are that n is between 10 and 20, so 10 < n < 20, which means n can be 11 up to 19.Let me try to break this down. First, let's define some variables:- Let h be the number of hits.- Let m be the number of misses.- The total number of shots is n, so h + m = n.Each hit gives 5 tokens, so total tokens from hits are 5h. Each miss takes away 3 tokens, so total tokens lost from misses are 3m. After all shots, he has no tokens left, so the total tokens from hits minus the tokens lost from misses equals zero. So, the equation is:5h - 3m = 0But since h + m = n, we can express m as n - h. Let me substitute that into the equation:5h - 3(n - h) = 0Let me expand that:5h - 3n + 3h = 0Combine like terms:(5h + 3h) - 3n = 08h - 3n = 0So, 8h = 3nWhich means h = (3n)/8Hmm, so h has to be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a hit. Similarly, n is also an integer between 11 and 19. So, (3n)/8 must be an integer. Therefore, 3n must be divisible by 8.Let me write that down: 3n ≡ 0 mod 8Which means n must be such that when multiplied by 3, it's a multiple of 8. So, n must be a multiple of 8/ gcd(3,8). Since gcd(3,8)=1, n must be a multiple of 8.But n is between 11 and 19. Let's see the multiples of 8 in that range. 8*1=8, which is less than 11. 8*2=16, which is within 11-19. 8*3=24, which is above 19. So, the only possible n is 16.Therefore, n=16.Now, let's find h. From h=(3n)/8, so h=(3*16)/8=48/8=6. So, h=6.Wait, so he had 6 hits and 16-6=10 misses.Let me check if that works. 6 hits give 6*5=30 tokens. 10 misses take away 10*3=30 tokens. So, 30-30=0 tokens left. That checks out.But wait, let me make sure there aren't any other possible n. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming n must be a multiple of 8. Let me think again.We have 8h = 3n, so h = (3n)/8. So, 3n must be divisible by 8. So, n must be such that 3n is a multiple of 8. Since 3 and 8 are coprime, n must be a multiple of 8. So, in the range 11-19, only 16 is a multiple of 8. So, n=16 is the only solution.Therefore, the total number of shots is 16, with 6 hits and 10 misses.Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I can try plugging in other n values to see if they work.Let's take n=12. Then h=(3*12)/8=36/8=4.5, which is not an integer. So, n=12 doesn't work.n=13: h=(3*13)/8=39/8=4.875, not integer.n=14: h=(3*14)/8=42/8=5.25, not integer.n=15: h=(3*15)/8=45/8=5.625, not integer.n=16: h=6, which is integer.n=17: h=(3*17)/8=51/8=6.375, not integer.n=18: h=(3*18)/8=54/8=6.75, not integer.n=19: h=(3*19)/8=57/8=7.125, not integer.So, indeed, only n=16 gives an integer value for h. Therefore, the answer is n=16 shots, with 6 hits and 10 misses.Just to make sure, let's calculate the tokens again. 6 hits give 6*5=30 tokens. 10 misses take away 10*3=30 tokens. 30-30=0, which matches the condition.So, I think that's the correct answer."},{"question":"In triangle triangle ABC, A(7,8), B(10,4), C(2,-4), then S_{triangle ABC} is ______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle ABC. The coordinates of the vertices are given: A is at (7,8), B is at (10,4), and C is at (2,-4). Hmm, okay. I remember there are a few ways to find the area of a triangle when you have the coordinates of its vertices. One method is using the shoelace formula, another is using vectors and the cross product, and maybe I can also use the formula involving base and height if I can figure out the lengths of the sides. Let me think about which method would be easiest here.The shoelace formula seems pretty straightforward because it directly uses the coordinates. I think it's called the shoelace formula because when you write down the coordinates in a certain way, it looks like lacing a shoe. Let me recall the formula. I believe it's something like taking the sum of the products of the coordinates in one diagonal direction and subtracting the sum of the products in the other diagonal direction, then taking half the absolute value of that result. Yeah, that sounds right.So, to apply the shoelace formula, I need to list the coordinates of the vertices in order, either clockwise or counterclockwise, and then repeat the first vertex at the end to complete the cycle. Let me write them down:A(7,8), B(10,4), C(2,-4), and then back to A(7,8).Now, I need to multiply the x-coordinate of each vertex by the y-coordinate of the next vertex and sum them up. Then, do the same but multiplying the y-coordinate of each vertex by the x-coordinate of the next vertex and sum those up. Then subtract the second sum from the first sum, take the absolute value, and divide by 2. That should give me the area.Let me write this out step by step.First, list the coordinates:A: (7,8)B: (10,4)C: (2,-4)A: (7,8)Now, calculate the sum of the products going one way (let's say from A to B to C to A):(7 * 4) + (10 * -4) + (2 * 8)Let me compute each term:7 * 4 = 2810 * -4 = -402 * 8 = 16Now, add these up: 28 + (-40) + 1628 - 40 is -12, and -12 + 16 is 4.Okay, so the first sum is 4.Now, calculate the sum going the other way (from A to C to B to A):(8 * 10) + (4 * 2) + (-4 * 7)Compute each term:8 * 10 = 804 * 2 = 8-4 * 7 = -28Add these up: 80 + 8 + (-28)80 + 8 is 88, and 88 - 28 is 60.So, the second sum is 60.Now, subtract the second sum from the first sum: 4 - 60 = -56.Take the absolute value: |-56| = 56.Divide by 2: 56 / 2 = 28.So, the area of triangle ABC is 28 square units.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to mix up the multiplication or addition steps.First sum:7 * 4 = 2810 * -4 = -402 * 8 = 1628 + (-40) = -12-12 + 16 = 4. That seems correct.Second sum:8 * 10 = 804 * 2 = 8-4 * 7 = -2880 + 8 = 8888 + (-28) = 60. That also seems correct.Subtracting: 4 - 60 = -56. Absolute value is 56, divided by 2 is 28. Okay, that seems consistent.Alternatively, I can use another method to verify. Maybe using vectors and the cross product.Let me try that. The area can also be calculated as half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC.First, find vectors AB and AC.Vector AB is from A to B: (10 - 7, 4 - 8) = (3, -4)Vector AC is from A to C: (2 - 7, -4 - 8) = (-5, -12)The cross product of AB and AC is (3)(-12) - (-4)(-5) = (-36) - (20) = -56The magnitude of the cross product is | -56 | = 56Half of that is 28. So, same result. Good, that confirms the area is indeed 28.Just to be thorough, maybe I can also compute the lengths of the sides and use Heron's formula. Let's see.First, compute the lengths of AB, BC, and AC.Distance formula: sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]Compute AB:A(7,8) to B(10,4):Difference in x: 10 - 7 = 3Difference in y: 4 - 8 = -4Length AB: sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5Compute BC:B(10,4) to C(2,-4):Difference in x: 2 - 10 = -8Difference in y: -4 - 4 = -8Length BC: sqrt((-8)^2 + (-8)^2) = sqrt(64 + 64) = sqrt(128) = 8*sqrt(2)Compute AC:A(7,8) to C(2,-4):Difference in x: 2 - 7 = -5Difference in y: -4 - 8 = -12Length AC: sqrt((-5)^2 + (-12)^2) = sqrt(25 + 144) = sqrt(169) = 13So, sides are 5, 8√2, and 13.Now, Heron's formula requires computing the semi-perimeter, s, which is (a + b + c)/2.So, s = (5 + 8√2 + 13)/2 = (18 + 8√2)/2 = 9 + 4√2Now, the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]Compute each term:s = 9 + 4√2s - a = (9 + 4√2) - 5 = 4 + 4√2s - b = (9 + 4√2) - 8√2 = 9 - 4√2s - c = (9 + 4√2) - 13 = -4 + 4√2So, the product is:(9 + 4√2)(4 + 4√2)(9 - 4√2)(-4 + 4√2)Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can pair them to simplify.Notice that (9 + 4√2)(9 - 4√2) is a difference of squares: 9^2 - (4√2)^2 = 81 - 16*2 = 81 - 32 = 49Similarly, (4 + 4√2)(-4 + 4√2) can be rewritten as (4√2 + 4)(4√2 - 4), which is also a difference of squares: (4√2)^2 - (4)^2 = 32 - 16 = 16So, the product becomes 49 * 16 = 784Therefore, the area is sqrt(784) = 28So, again, the area is 28. That matches the previous methods. So, I'm pretty confident now that the area is 28.Just to recap, I used three different methods:1. Shoelace formula: Got 28.2. Cross product of vectors: Got 28.3. Heron's formula: Got 28.All three methods led me to the same answer, so I think that's solid.I was a bit worried when I saw the coordinates because they don't form a right triangle or anything obvious, but the shoelace formula worked smoothly. I also thought Heron's formula might be a pain because of the square roots, but pairing the terms made it manageable.I guess another way to think about it is plotting the points on a coordinate plane and seeing if I can break the triangle into simpler shapes, but since the coordinates are spread out, that might not be as straightforward. The methods I used are more algebraic and precise.So, yeah, after carefully going through each step and verifying with multiple methods, I'm pretty sure the area is 28.**Final Answer**The area of triangle ABC is boxed{28}."},{"question":"Two planes divide the space into at most ____ parts.","answer":"To determine the maximum number of parts into which two planes can divide space, I start by considering the first plane.

Jia has a fixed seat. If Yi and Ding cannot sit next to each other, how many different seating arrangements are possible?A. 10B. 8C. 12D. 16","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, and Wu are sitting around a circular table to play cards. Jia has a fixed seat, which probably means we don't have to worry about rotations being different arrangements. The main condition is that Yi and Ding cannot sit next to each other. I need to figure out how many different seating arrangements are possible under these conditions. The options given are A. 10, B. 8, C. 12, D. 16.Hmm, let me break this down. First, since it's a circular table and Jia's seat is fixed, we can consider the problem as arranging the remaining four people around the table relative to Jia. In circular permutations, fixing one person's seat removes the rotational symmetry, so we don't have to divide by the number of seats or anything like that.So, normally, without any restrictions, the number of ways to arrange four people around a fixed circular table is (4-1)! = 3! = 6. Wait, no, actually, since Jia's seat is fixed, the remaining four can be arranged in 4! ways, right? Because each of the four seats is distinct relative to Jia. So, 4! = 24 total arrangements.But we have a restriction: Yi and Ding cannot sit next to each other. So, I need to subtract the number of arrangements where Yi and Ding are sitting next to each other from the total number of arrangements.To find the number of arrangements where Yi and Ding are sitting next to each other, I can treat Yi and Ding as a single entity or \\"block.\\" So, instead of having four individuals, we now have three entities: the Yi-Ding block, Bing, and Wu. Since it's a circular table with Jia fixed, the number of ways to arrange these three entities is (3-1)! = 2! = 2. But wait, within the Yi-Ding block, Yi and Ding can switch places, so we have 2 arrangements for the block itself. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where Yi and Ding are sitting next to each other is 2 * 2 = 4.Wait, hold on. Let me think again. If we fix Jia's seat, the table is effectively linearized relative to Jia. So, the seats are fixed in order around Jia. Therefore, treating Yi and Ding as a block, how many ways can we arrange them?Actually, in a circular table with one fixed seat, the number of ways to arrange n people is (n-1)! because of rotational symmetry. But since Jia is fixed, the remaining n-1 people can be arranged in (n-1)! ways. So, in this case, n=5, so 4! = 24 total arrangements.When considering Yi and Ding sitting together, we can think of them as a single entity, so we have four entities: Jia (fixed), Yi-Ding, Bing, and Wu. But since Jia is fixed, the number of ways to arrange the other four is actually 3! = 6. But within the Yi-Ding block, they can switch places, so multiply by 2, giving 12 arrangements where Yi and Ding are sitting together.Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.Wait, no. Let me clarify. When Jia's seat is fixed, the circular table becomes effectively a straight line with Jia at one end. So, the number of ways to arrange the other four people is 4! = 24. If we consider Yi and Ding sitting together, we can treat them as a single entity, so we have three entities: Yi-Ding, Bing, and Wu. These three can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. But since Yi and Ding can switch places within the block, we have 6 * 2 = 12 arrangements where Yi and Ding are sitting together.Therefore, the total number of valid arrangements is total arrangements minus the invalid ones: 24 - 12 = 12. So, the answer should be 12, which is option C.But wait, hold on. Let me verify this another way. Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or something else.Alternatively, maybe I can fix Jia's seat and then count the number of ways to arrange the others such that Yi and Ding are not adjacent.So, Jia is fixed. Let's label the seats clockwise as Seat 1 (Jia), Seat 2, Seat 3, Seat 4, Seat 5.We need to arrange Yi, Bing, Ding, and Wu in Seats 2, 3, 4, 5 such that Yi and Ding are not sitting next to each other.First, total number of arrangements: 4! = 24.Number of arrangements where Yi and Ding are sitting next to each other: Let's find how many adjacent pairs there are.In a circular table with Jia fixed, the seats are in a line from Seat 2 to Seat 5. So, the adjacent pairs are (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). Note that Seat 5 is next to Seat 2 because it's a circular table. Wait, no, Seat 5 is next to Seat 4 and Seat 1 (Jia). So, in this case, Seat 5 is adjacent to Seat 4 and Seat 1, which is fixed. So, the adjacent pairs for the remaining seats are (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). So, three adjacent pairs.Wait, but Seat 5 is adjacent to Seat 4 and Seat 1, but Seat 1 is fixed, so Seat 5 is only adjacent to Seat 4 in terms of the remaining people. So, the adjacent pairs among the remaining seats are (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). So, three pairs.Therefore, the number of ways Yi and Ding can sit next to each other is 3 pairs * 2 arrangements (Yi on the left or right) * 2! arrangements for the remaining two people. Wait, let me think.If Yi and Ding are sitting in a specific adjacent pair, say (2,3), then Yi can be in 2 and Ding in 3, or Ding in 2 and Yi in 3. So, 2 possibilities. Then, the remaining two people, Bing and Wu, can be arranged in the remaining two seats in 2! = 2 ways. So, for each adjacent pair, there are 2 * 2 = 4 arrangements.Since there are three adjacent pairs, total number of arrangements where Yi and Ding are sitting together is 3 * 4 = 12.Therefore, total valid arrangements are 24 - 12 = 12. So, again, the answer is 12, which is option C.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a different way to compute this?Alternatively, maybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Total arrangements: 24. Subtract the arrangements where Yi and Ding are adjacent: 12. So, 24 - 12 = 12.Alternatively, maybe I can compute it directly by considering the number of ways to seat the others without Yi and Ding being adjacent.So, fix Jia at Seat 1. Then, we have Seats 2, 3, 4, 5 to arrange Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu.We need to ensure that Yi and Ding are not adjacent.First, let's count the number of ways to arrange the four people without Yi and Ding sitting next to each other.Alternatively, we can use the principle of derangements or something similar, but it's a bit different here.Alternatively, think of it as arranging the four people with the restriction.First, seat Yi somewhere. There are 4 choices for Yi's seat.Then, Ding cannot sit next to Yi. Depending on where Yi is seated, Ding has fewer options.Wait, let's see.Seat 2: adjacent to Seat 1 (Jia) and Seat 3.Seat 3: adjacent to Seat 2 and Seat 4.Seat 4: adjacent to Seat 3 and Seat 5.Seat 5: adjacent to Seat 4 and Seat 1 (Jia).So, if Yi is seated in Seat 2, then Ding cannot be in Seat 3 or Seat 1. But Seat 1 is fixed as Jia, so Ding cannot be in Seat 3.Similarly, if Yi is in Seat 3, Ding cannot be in Seat 2 or Seat 4.If Yi is in Seat 4, Ding cannot be in Seat 3 or Seat 5.If Yi is in Seat 5, Ding cannot be in Seat 4 or Seat 1 (Seat 1 is Jia, so Ding cannot be in Seat 4).So, depending on Yi's seat, Ding has 2 or 3 forbidden seats.Wait, let's go step by step.Case 1: Yi is seated in Seat 2.Then, Ding cannot be in Seat 3.So, Ding has 3 choices: Seat 4, Seat 5, or Seat 1. But Seat 1 is fixed as Jia, so Ding cannot be there. So, Ding can be in Seat 4 or Seat 5: 2 choices.Then, after placing Yi and Ding, we have two remaining seats for Bing and Wu, which can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.So, total arrangements for Case 1: 1 (Yi in 2) * 2 (Ding in 4 or 5) * 2 (Bing and Wu) = 4.Case 2: Yi is seated in Seat 3.Then, Ding cannot be in Seat 2 or Seat 4.So, Ding can be in Seat 5 or Seat 1. Seat 1 is fixed, so Ding can only be in Seat 5: 1 choice.Then, the remaining two seats are Seat 2 and Seat 4, which can be occupied by Bing and Wu in 2! = 2 ways.So, total arrangements for Case 2: 1 (Yi in 3) * 1 (Ding in 5) * 2 (Bing and Wu) = 2.Case 3: Yi is seated in Seat 4.Symmetric to Case 1. So, similar to Case 1.Yi in Seat 4, Ding cannot be in Seat 3 or Seat 5.So, Ding can be in Seat 2 or Seat 1. Seat 1 is fixed, so Ding can be in Seat 2: 1 choice.Wait, no, Seat 1 is fixed, so if Yi is in Seat 4, Ding cannot be in Seat 3 or Seat 5. So, available seats for Ding are Seat 2 and Seat 1. But Seat 1 is fixed, so only Seat 2 is available for Ding.So, Ding can be in Seat 2: 1 choice.Then, remaining seats are Seat 3 and Seat 5, which can be occupied by Bing and Wu in 2! = 2 ways.So, total arrangements for Case 3: 1 (Yi in 4) * 1 (Ding in 2) * 2 (Bing and Wu) = 2.Case 4: Yi is seated in Seat 5.Then, Ding cannot be in Seat 4 or Seat 1 (Seat 1 is fixed). So, Ding cannot be in Seat 4.So, Ding can be in Seat 2 or Seat 3: 2 choices.Then, the remaining two seats are Seat 2 or Seat 3 (depending on Ding's choice) and Seat 4, which can be occupied by Bing and Wu in 2! = 2 ways.So, total arrangements for Case 4: 1 (Yi in 5) * 2 (Ding in 2 or 3) * 2 (Bing and Wu) = 4.Adding up all the cases: Case 1 (4) + Case 2 (2) + Case 3 (2) + Case 4 (4) = 12.So, again, we get 12 valid arrangements.Therefore, the answer is 12, which is option C.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another approach.Another way is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.Total number of arrangements: 4! = 24.Number of arrangements where Yi and Ding are sitting together: as calculated earlier, 12.Therefore, valid arrangements: 24 - 12 = 12.Yes, that's consistent.Alternatively, using the formula for circular permutations with restrictions.But since Jia's seat is fixed, it's effectively a linear arrangement relative to Jia, so the problem reduces to linear permutations with the restriction that Yi and Ding are not adjacent.In linear arrangements, the number of ways to arrange n items with two specific items not adjacent is (n-2)! * (n - 1). Wait, no, that's not quite right.Wait, in linear arrangements, the total number is n! The number of arrangements where two specific items are adjacent is 2*(n-1)! So, the number of non-adjacent arrangements is n! - 2*(n-1)!.But in our case, n=4 (since Jia is fixed, we have four seats to arrange Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu). So, total arrangements: 4! = 24.Number of arrangements where Yi and Ding are adjacent: 2*3! = 12.Therefore, non-adjacent arrangements: 24 - 12 = 12.So, same result.Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 12, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"In how many ways can six marbles be placed in the squares of a  6 -by- 6  grid such that no two marbles lie in the same row or column?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"In how many ways can six marbles be placed in the squares of a 6-by-6 grid such that no two marbles lie in the same row or column?\\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to visualize the grid. It's a 6x6 grid, which means there are 6 rows and 6 columns, making 36 squares in total. I have to place six marbles on this grid, one in each square, but with the condition that no two marbles are in the same row or column. So, each marble must be in a unique row and a unique column.Let me think about how to approach this. Since each marble must be in a different row and column, it's similar to arranging six items where each item is in a distinct position. Wait, this sounds a lot like permutations. In permutations, we arrange items where each position is unique, right?So, if I consider each row as a position where I need to place a marble, the first marble can go into any of the 6 columns. Once I place the first marble in a column, I can't use that column again for the next marble. So, for the second marble, I have 5 remaining columns to choose from. Similarly, the third marble would have 4 columns left, and so on until the sixth marble, which would have only 1 column left.So, in terms of multiplication principle, the number of ways should be 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which is 6 factorial, written as 6!. Calculating that, 6! = 720. So, does that mean there are 720 ways?Wait, let me verify if I'm not missing something here. The grid is 6x6, so each marble is placed in a unique row and column. So, for the first row, I have 6 choices of columns. For the second row, since one column is already taken by the first marble, I have 5 choices left. For the third row, 4 choices, and so on. So, yeah, that seems correct.Alternatively, I can think of this as arranging 6 marbles in the grid such that each row and column has exactly one marble. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 6 elements, which is indeed 6!.Another way to think about it is using combinations. If I were to choose 6 squares out of 36, that would be C(36,6). But that's not considering the restrictions. Since each marble must be in a unique row and column, it's more constrained than just choosing any 6 squares.So, perhaps another approach is to consider the problem as a permutation matrix. A permutation matrix is a square matrix where exactly one entry in each row and each column is a 1, and the rest are 0s. The number of such matrices for an n x n grid is n!, which in this case is 6! = 720. So, that aligns with my earlier reasoning.Wait, but let me make sure I'm not conflating concepts here. A permutation matrix does represent a bijection between rows and columns, which is exactly what placing marbles without sharing a row or column is. So, yes, each arrangement corresponds to a permutation matrix, and the number of permutation matrices of size 6x6 is 6!.Alternatively, I can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem. Imagine two sets of nodes: one set representing the rows and the other representing the columns. Each row node is connected to each column node, representing the possible placements of marbles. The problem then reduces to finding the number of perfect matchings in this bipartite graph.In a complete bipartite graph K_{n,n}, the number of perfect matchings is n!. So, for K_{6,6}, it's 6! = 720. That's another way to confirm the answer.But just to ensure I'm thorough, let me think about it step by step for smaller grids to see if the pattern holds.Suppose I have a 1x1 grid. Then, obviously, there's only 1 way to place the marble. 1! = 1, which matches.For a 2x2 grid, how many ways? Let's enumerate:- Place marble in (1,1) and (2,2)- Place marble in (1,2) and (2,1)So, 2 ways, which is 2! = 2. That works.For a 3x3 grid, the number of ways should be 6. Let me see:- (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)- (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)- (1,2), (2,1), (3,3)- (1,2), (2,3), (3,1)- (1,3), (2,1), (3,2)- (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)Yes, that's 6 ways, which is 3! = 6. So, the pattern holds.Therefore, for a 6x6 grid, it's 6! = 720 ways.Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me think about another perspective. Suppose I pick one marble at a time.First marble: 6 choices in the first row.Second marble: Since one column is already taken, in the second row, I have 5 choices.Third marble: 4 choices in the third row.Continuing this way, the number of choices decreases by one each time.So, the total number of ways is 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, if I think of it as assigning columns to each row. For the first row, assign any of the 6 columns. For the second row, assign any of the remaining 5 columns, and so on. So, again, 6!.I think I've covered multiple angles here: permutations, permutation matrices, bipartite graphs, and step-by-step placement. All of them lead to the same conclusion.Therefore, I feel confident that the number of ways is 720.**Final Answer**The number of ways is boxed{720}."},{"question":"Given that the graph of the power function y = x^n passes through the point (2,8), then n = boxed{3}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the graph of the power function y = x^n passes through the point (2,8). I need to find the value of n. Hmm, power functions, right? They have the form y = x raised to some exponent. So, in this case, it's y = x^n. Alright, so the graph passes through (2,8). That means when x is 2, y is 8. So, I can plug those values into the equation to find n. Let me write that down:8 = 2^nHmm, okay, so I need to solve for n in this equation. I remember that exponents can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can rewrite this in logarithmic form or think about what power I need to raise 2 to get 8.Let me think: 2 to the first power is 2, 2 squared is 4, 2 cubed is 8. Oh, wait, that's it! So, 2^3 is 8. That means n must be 3. But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me double-check. If n is 3, then plugging x = 2 into y = x^3 gives y = 8, which matches the point (2,8). Yep, that seems right.I guess another way to look at it is by taking the logarithm of both sides. If I take the natural log of both sides, I get:ln(8) = ln(2^n)Using the logarithm power rule, that becomes:ln(8) = n * ln(2)Then, solving for n, I can divide both sides by ln(2):n = ln(8) / ln(2)I know that ln(8) is the same as ln(2^3), which is 3 ln(2). So, substituting that in:n = (3 ln(2)) / ln(2) = 3So, that confirms it again. n is 3. Wait, just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Let me calculate ln(8) and ln(2) numerically to see if their ratio is indeed 3.Calculating ln(8): I know that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, so ln(8) is ln(2^3) = 3 * ln(2) ≈ 3 * 0.6931 ≈ 2.0794.Calculating ln(2): That's approximately 0.6931.So, dividing ln(8) by ln(2) gives 2.0794 / 0.6931 ≈ 3. So, that's correct. Alternatively, if I use base 2 logarithm, log base 2 of 8 is 3 because 2^3 = 8. So, that also gives n = 3.I think I've covered all the bases here. I approached it by recognizing the powers of 2, then double-checked using logarithms, both natural and base 2. All methods point to n being 3. Is there any other way to verify this? Maybe by graphing the function y = x^3 and seeing if it indeed passes through (2,8). Well, when x is 2, y is 8, so the point (2,8) lies on the curve. That makes sense because 2^3 is 8. I guess another thing to consider is whether there could be another exponent that also satisfies 2^n = 8. Let's think about negative exponents or fractional exponents. If n were negative, say n = -3, then 2^-3 is 1/8, which is not 8. So, that's out. What about fractional exponents? For example, n = 1/3 would give 2^(1/3) which is the cube root of 2, approximately 1.26, not 8. Similarly, n = 2 would give 4, which is less than 8, and n = 4 would give 16, which is more than 8. So, n has to be exactly 3 to get 8 when x is 2.I think that's thorough enough. I can't think of any other exponents that would satisfy 2^n = 8 except for n = 3. So, yeah, I'm confident that n is 3.**Final Answer**The value of ( n ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Let ( a, b, c ) be pairwise distinct positive integers such that ( a+b, b+c ) and ( c+a ) are all square numbers. Find the smallest possible value of ( a+b+c ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find three distinct positive integers a, b, and c such that the sums a+b, b+c, and c+a are all perfect squares. And I need to find the smallest possible value of a+b+c. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We have three numbers a, b, c, all positive integers, and each pair adds up to a square number. So, a+b = x², b+c = y², and c+a = z², where x, y, z are integers. Also, a, b, c must be distinct. The goal is to minimize the total sum a+b+c.Since a, b, c are positive integers, their sums will be at least 2 (since the smallest positive integers are 1, so 1+1=2, but since they have to be distinct, actually, the smallest possible sum is 1+2=3). But since we need all three sums to be squares, let me think about possible square numbers.Let me note that a+b, b+c, and c+a are all squares. Let me denote:a + b = p²  b + c = q²  c + a = r²  Where p, q, r are integers greater than or equal to 2, since the smallest sum is 3, which isn't a square, so the next possible square is 4 (2²). So p, q, r ≥ 2.Now, if I add all three equations together, I get:(a + b) + (b + c) + (c + a) = p² + q² + r²  2(a + b + c) = p² + q² + r²  Therefore, a + b + c = (p² + q² + r²)/2So, the total sum is half the sum of three squares. Since a, b, c are integers, (p² + q² + r²) must be even, so the sum of the three squares must be even. That means either all three squares are even, or exactly two are odd and one is even.But squares are either even or odd. An even square is divisible by 4, and an odd square is 1 mod 4. So, if all three squares are even, their sum is divisible by 4, so (p² + q² + r²)/2 is even. If two are odd and one is even, their sum is 2*(1 mod 4) + 0 mod 4 = 2 mod 4, so (p² + q² + r²)/2 is 1 mod 2, which is odd. So, the total sum a + b + c can be either even or odd, depending on p, q, r.But regardless, our goal is to minimize a + b + c, so we need to find the smallest possible p, q, r such that the resulting a, b, c are positive integers, distinct, and satisfy the equations.Let me try to express a, b, c in terms of p, q, r.From the three equations:a + b = p²  b + c = q²  c + a = r²  Let me solve for a, b, c.Adding the first two equations: a + 2b + c = p² + q²  But from the third equation, c + a = r², so substituting:  r² + 2b = p² + q²  Therefore, 2b = p² + q² - r²  So, b = (p² + q² - r²)/2Similarly, adding the first and third equations: 2a + b + c = p² + r²  But from the second equation, b + c = q², so substituting:  2a + q² = p² + r²  Therefore, 2a = p² + r² - q²  So, a = (p² + r² - q²)/2Similarly, adding the second and third equations: a + 2c + b = q² + r²  But from the first equation, a + b = p², so substituting:  p² + 2c = q² + r²  Therefore, 2c = q² + r² - p²  So, c = (q² + r² - p²)/2So, we have expressions for a, b, c in terms of p², q², r². Since a, b, c must be positive integers, each of these expressions must result in positive integers. So, the numerators must be even and positive.So, let's write down the conditions:1. (p² + q² - r²) must be even and positive.  2. (p² + r² - q²) must be even and positive.  3. (q² + r² - p²) must be even and positive.So, all three numerators must be positive and even.Let me note that p², q², r² must satisfy triangle-like inequalities because a, b, c must be positive. So, for example, p² + q² > r², p² + r² > q², and q² + r² > p². So, the squares must form a triangle in terms of their magnitudes.Therefore, p, q, r must satisfy the triangle inequality in terms of their squares.So, perhaps the minimal p, q, r are small integers, maybe starting from 2 upwards.Let me try to find such p, q, r.Let me start with small squares:2²=4, 3²=9, 4²=16, 5²=25, 6²=36, 7²=49, 8²=64, 9²=81, 10²=100, etc.I need to find p, q, r such that p² + q² > r², p² + r² > q², q² + r² > p², and also that (p² + q² - r²), (p² + r² - q²), and (q² + r² - p²) are all even and positive.Let me try small combinations.First, let me try p=2, q=3, r=4.Compute:a = (4 + 16 - 9)/2 = (11)/2 = 5.5, which is not integer. So discard.Next, p=2, q=3, r=5.a = (4 + 25 - 9)/2 = 20/2=10  b = (4 + 9 -25)/2 = (-12)/2 = -6, which is negative. Not allowed.So discard.Next, p=2, q=4, r=5.a = (4 + 25 - 16)/2 = 13/2=6.5, not integer.p=2, q=4, r=6.a=(4 + 36 - 16)/2=24/2=12  b=(4 + 16 -36)/2=(-16)/2=-8, negative. Not allowed.p=2, q=5, r=6.a=(4 + 36 -25)/2=15/2=7.5, not integer.p=3, q=4, r=5.a=(9 + 25 -16)/2=18/2=9  b=(9 + 16 -25)/2=0/2=0, but b must be positive. So discard.p=3, q=4, r=6.a=(9 + 36 -16)/2=29/2=14.5, not integer.p=3, q=5, r=6.a=(9 + 36 -25)/2=20/2=10  b=(9 + 25 -36)/2= (-2)/2=-1, negative. Discard.p=4, q=5, r=6.a=(16 + 36 -25)/2=27/2=13.5, not integer.p=3, q=5, r=7.a=(9 + 49 -25)/2=33/2=16.5, not integer.p=4, q=5, r=7.a=(16 + 49 -25)/2=40/2=20  b=(16 +25 -49)/2=(-8)/2=-4, negative. Discard.p=4, q=6, r=7.a=(16 + 49 -36)/2=29/2=14.5, not integer.p=5, q=6, r=7.a=(25 + 49 -36)/2=38/2=19  b=(25 +36 -49)/2=12/2=6  c=(36 +49 -25)/2=60/2=30So, a=19, b=6, c=30.Check if they are distinct: 19,6,30 are distinct. Good.Check the sums:a + b =19 +6=25=5², good.  b + c=6 +30=36=6², good.  c + a=30 +19=49=7², good.So, that works. The total sum is 19 +6 +30=55.Is this the minimal possible? Let me check if there are smaller p, q, r that can give a smaller total.Wait, let's see. Maybe p=5, q=5, r=6? But p, q, r need not be distinct, but a, b, c must be distinct. Wait, p, q, r can be same or different, but a, b, c must be distinct.Wait, let me try p=3, q=4, r=5 again, but earlier that gave b=0, which is invalid.What about p=3, q=5, r=6? That gave a=10, b=-1, which is invalid.Wait, maybe p=4, q=5, r=6? That gave a=13.5, which is invalid.Wait, p=5, q=5, r=6. Let's try that.a=(25 + 36 -25)/2=36/2=18  b=(25 +25 -36)/2=14/2=7  c=(25 +36 -25)/2=36/2=18But then a=18 and c=18, which are not distinct.

Maybe instead of starting with p=5, q=6, r=7, maybe another combination.Wait, let me think of a, b, c such that a + b, b + c, c + a are squares.Let me try to find small a, b, c.Let me assume a < b < c.So, a + b is the smallest square, b + c is the next, and c + a is the largest.So, let me try small squares for a + b.The smallest square is 4, but since a and b are positive integers, a + b ≥ 3. But 3 is not a square, so the next is 4.So, let me try a + b=4.Possible pairs (a,b): (1,3), (2,2). But a, b must be distinct, so (1,3).Then, b + c must be a square. b=3, so 3 + c must be a square. The next square after 4 is 9. So, 3 + c=9 ⇒ c=6.Then, c + a=6 +1=7, which is not a square. So, invalid.Next square for b + c: 16. 3 + c=16 ⇒ c=13.Then, c + a=13 +1=14, not a square.Next square: 25. 3 + c=25 ⇒ c=22.c + a=22 +1=23, not a square.Hmm, not working.Next, a + b=9.Possible pairs: (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5).Let me try a=1, b=8.Then, b + c=8 + c must be a square. Next square after 9 is 16. So, 8 + c=16 ⇒ c=8.But c=8, which is same as b=8. Not distinct. Invalid.Next square: 25. 8 + c=25 ⇒ c=17.Then, c + a=17 +1=18, not a square.Next square: 36. 8 + c=36 ⇒ c=28.c + a=28 +1=29, not a square.Not working.Next pair: a=2, b=7.b + c=7 + c must be square.

But a, b must be distinct, so exclude (8,8).Let me try a=1, b=15.Then, b + c=15 + c must be square.

Since we already have a solution with total sum 55, which is a + b + c=55, which is smaller than 25 + something.Wait, 55 is smaller than 25 + 25 +25=75, so 55 is better.Wait, but let me see if a + b=25 can give a smaller total sum.Wait, a + b=25, then b + c and c + a must be squares larger than 25.But let me try.a + b=25.Possible pairs: (1,24), (2,23), ..., (12,13).Let me try a=1, b=24.Then, b + c=24 + c must be square.

Oh, that's a square!So, c=44.So, a=5, b=20, c=44.Check sums:a + b=5 +20=25=5²  b + c=20 +44=64=8²  c + a=44 +5=49=7²So, that works. The total sum is 5 +20 +44=69, which is larger than 55.Wait, but let me check if c + a=49, which is 7², so that's good.But 69 is larger than 55, so 55 is still better.Wait, let me see if a + b=25 can give a smaller total.Wait, a=6, b=19.b + c=19 + c must be square. Next square after 25 is 36. 19 + c=36 ⇒ c=17.c + a=17 +6=23, not a square.Next square: 49. 19 + c=49 ⇒ c=30.c + a=30 +6=36=6². That's good.So, c=30.So, a=6, b=19, c=30.Check sums:a + b=6 +19=25=5²  b + c=19 +30=49=7²  c + a=30 +6=36=6²Wait, that's the same as the earlier solution but with a and b swapped.Wait, a=6, b=19, c=30. Total sum=6 +19 +30=55.Wait, so same total sum, just different ordering.So, that's another way to get 55.So, that confirms that 55 is achievable.Wait, so maybe 55 is indeed the minimal.Wait, let me check if a + b=25 can give a smaller total.Wait, a=7, b=18.b + c=18 + c must be square.

It is given that ( a ) and ( b ) are two real numbers such that ( f(a) = 1 ) and ( f(b) = 19 ). Find the value of ( (a + b)^{2} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of ((a + b)^2) given that (f(a) = 1) and (f(b) = 19) for the function (f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 14). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that (f(a) = 1) and (f(b) = 19). So, if I plug in (a) into the function, I get 1, and plugging in (b) gives me 19. Let me write down those equations:1. (a^3 + 3a^2 + 6a + 14 = 1)2. (b^3 + 3b^2 + 6b + 14 = 19)Okay, so I can simplify both equations to make them easier to work with. Let me subtract 1 from both sides of the first equation:(a^3 + 3a^2 + 6a + 14 - 1 = 0)Which simplifies to:(a^3 + 3a^2 + 6a + 13 = 0)Similarly, for the second equation, subtract 19 from both sides:(b^3 + 3b^2 + 6b + 14 - 19 = 0)Which simplifies to:(b^3 + 3b^2 + 6b - 5 = 0)Hmm, so now I have two cubic equations:1. (a^3 + 3a^2 + 6a + 13 = 0)2. (b^3 + 3b^2 + 6b - 5 = 0)I need to find ((a + b)^2). I remember that ((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2), so maybe if I can find (a + b) or some relationship between (a) and (b), I can compute this.Looking at the two equations, they both have similar structures. Maybe I can relate them somehow. Let me denote (f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 14), so (f(a) = 1) and (f(b) = 19). Let me think about the function (f(x)). It's a cubic function, so it's strictly increasing because its derivative is always positive. Let me check the derivative:(f'(x) = 3x^2 + 6x + 6)Hmm, that's a quadratic. To see if it's always positive, I can compute its discriminant:Discriminant (D = 6^2 - 4*3*6 = 36 - 72 = -36)Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots, meaning (f'(x)) is always positive. So, (f(x)) is strictly increasing. That means there's only one real root for each equation (f(x) = 1) and (f(x) = 19). So, (a) and (b) are unique real numbers.But how does that help me? Maybe I can consider the function (f(x)) and see if there's a substitution or transformation that can relate (a) and (b). Let me try to manipulate the function a bit.Looking at (f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 14), I notice that the coefficients are 1, 3, 6, and 14. Maybe I can complete the cube or something similar. Let me try to write (f(x)) in terms of ((x + k)^3) for some (k).Let me expand ((x + k)^3):((x + k)^3 = x^3 + 3k x^2 + 3k^2 x + k^3)Comparing this to (f(x)):(x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 14)So, if I set (3k = 3), that gives (k = 1). Let's see:((x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1)Hmm, so (f(x)) can be written as:(f(x) = (x + 1)^3 + 3x + 13)Wait, let me check:((x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1)So, (f(x) = (x + 1)^3 + 3x + 13). Let me compute that:(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 + 3x + 13 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 14)Yes, that's correct. So, (f(x) = (x + 1)^3 + 3x + 13). Hmm, maybe that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can write (f(x)) as ((x + 1)^3 + 3(x + 1) + 10). Let me check:((x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1)(3(x + 1) = 3x + 3)Adding them together: (x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 + 3x + 3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 4)Then adding 10 gives (x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 14), which is (f(x)). So, yes, (f(x) = (x + 1)^3 + 3(x + 1) + 10).Wait, that might be useful. Let me denote (y = x + 1), so (x = y - 1). Then, (f(x) = y^3 + 3y + 10). So, (f(x)) can be rewritten as (y^3 + 3y + 10), where (y = x + 1).So, if I let (y = x + 1), then (f(x) = y^3 + 3y + 10). Therefore, the equation (f(x) = 1) becomes:(y^3 + 3y + 10 = 1)Which simplifies to:(y^3 + 3y + 9 = 0)Similarly, (f(x) = 19) becomes:(y^3 + 3y + 10 = 19)Which simplifies to:(y^3 + 3y - 9 = 0)So, now I have two equations in terms of (y):1. (y_a^3 + 3y_a + 9 = 0) where (y_a = a + 1)2. (y_b^3 + 3y_b - 9 = 0) where (y_b = b + 1)Hmm, interesting. So, if I let (y_a) and (y_b) be the solutions to these equations, then (y_a^3 + 3y_a = -9) and (y_b^3 + 3y_b = 9). If I add these two equations together:(y_a^3 + y_b^3 + 3y_a + 3y_b = 0)That's because (-9 + 9 = 0). So, (y_a^3 + y_b^3 + 3(y_a + y_b) = 0)I remember that (y_a^3 + y_b^3) can be factored as ((y_a + y_b)(y_a^2 - y_a y_b + y_b^2)). Let me write that:((y_a + y_b)(y_a^2 - y_a y_b + y_b^2) + 3(y_a + y_b) = 0)Factor out (y_a + y_b):((y_a + y_b)(y_a^2 - y_a y_b + y_b^2 + 3) = 0)So, either (y_a + y_b = 0) or (y_a^2 - y_a y_b + y_b^2 + 3 = 0).But (y_a^2 - y_a y_b + y_b^2 + 3 = 0) would require that (y_a^2 - y_a y_b + y_b^2 = -3). However, (y_a^2 - y_a y_b + y_b^2) is always non-negative because it's equal to (frac{3}{4}(y_a - y_b)^2 + frac{1}{4}(y_a + y_b)^2), which is a sum of squares. So, it can't be negative. Therefore, the only possibility is (y_a + y_b = 0).So, (y_a + y_b = 0), which means (y_b = -y_a). Therefore, (y_b = -y_a). But (y_a = a + 1) and (y_b = b + 1), so:(b + 1 = -(a + 1))Simplify:(b + 1 = -a - 1)Bring all terms to one side:(a + b + 2 = 0)Therefore:(a + b = -2)So, (a + b = -2). Therefore, ((a + b)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4).Wait, so is that the answer? Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I transformed the function (f(x)) by substituting (y = x + 1), which led me to express (f(x)) as (y^3 + 3y + 10). Then, setting (f(a) = 1) and (f(b) = 19) gave me two equations in terms of (y_a) and (y_b). Adding these equations, I found that (y_a + y_b = 0), which translated back to (a + b = -2). Squaring that gives 4.Let me double-check the substitution step. If (y = x + 1), then (x = y - 1). Plugging into (f(x)):(f(x) = (y - 1)^3 + 3(y - 1)^2 + 6(y - 1) + 14)Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me compute (f(x)) in terms of (y) again.Wait, no, I think I confused myself. Earlier, I considered (f(x) = (x + 1)^3 + 3(x + 1) + 10), which is correct because:((x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1)Adding (3(x + 1)) gives (3x + 3), so total is (x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 4). Then adding 10 gives (x^3 + 3x^2 + 6x + 14), which is correct.So, (f(x) = (x + 1)^3 + 3(x + 1) + 10). So, if I let (y = x + 1), then (f(x) = y^3 + 3y + 10). Therefore, (f(a) = 1) becomes (y_a^3 + 3y_a + 10 = 1), which is (y_a^3 + 3y_a + 9 = 0), and (f(b) = 19) becomes (y_b^3 + 3y_b + 10 = 19), which is (y_b^3 + 3y_b - 9 = 0). So, that part is correct.Adding the two equations:(y_a^3 + y_b^3 + 3y_a + 3y_b + 9 - 9 = 0)Wait, no, actually, the equations are:1. (y_a^3 + 3y_a + 9 = 0)2. (y_b^3 + 3y_b - 9 = 0)So, adding them:(y_a^3 + y_b^3 + 3y_a + 3y_b + 9 - 9 = 0)Which simplifies to:(y_a^3 + y_b^3 + 3y_a + 3y_b = 0)Which is what I had before. Then factoring, I concluded (y_a + y_b = 0), leading to (a + b = -2). So, that seems correct.Therefore, ((a + b)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4). So, the answer should be 4.But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by using the fact that (f(x)) is strictly increasing and thus (a) and (b) are unique. Maybe I can find (a) and (b) numerically and then compute (a + b). But that might be time-consuming.Alternatively, let me consider the function (f(x)) and see if it's symmetric in some way or if there's a relationship between (a) and (b). Since (f(a) = 1) and (f(b) = 19), and (f(x)) is strictly increasing, (a < b) because (1 < 19). But how does that help?Wait, another thought: if I consider (f(a) + f(b)), maybe that can be expressed in terms of (a + b). Let me compute (f(a) + f(b)):(f(a) + f(b) = 1 + 19 = 20)But (f(a) + f(b) = (a^3 + 3a^2 + 6a + 14) + (b^3 + 3b^2 + 6b + 14) = a^3 + b^3 + 3(a^2 + b^2) + 6(a + b) + 28)So, (a^3 + b^3 + 3(a^2 + b^2) + 6(a + b) + 28 = 20)Simplify:(a^3 + b^3 + 3(a^2 + b^2) + 6(a + b) = -8)Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I can relate this to the earlier result where (a + b = -2). Let me see.If (a + b = -2), then (a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab = 4 - 2ab). Similarly, (a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) = (-2)^3 - 3ab(-2) = -8 + 6ab).So, substituting back into the equation:((-8 + 6ab) + 3(4 - 2ab) + 6(-2) = -8)Let me compute each term:1. (a^3 + b^3 = -8 + 6ab)2. (3(a^2 + b^2) = 3(4 - 2ab) = 12 - 6ab)3. (6(a + b) = 6(-2) = -12)Adding them together:((-8 + 6ab) + (12 - 6ab) + (-12) = (-8 + 12 - 12) + (6ab - 6ab) = (-8) + 0 = -8)Which equals the right-hand side, which is -8. So, this checks out. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that (a + b = -2) is consistent.Therefore, ((a + b)^2 = 4). So, the answer is 4.**Final Answer**boxed{4}"},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_1=1, a_2a_4=16, then a_7= _____ .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me make sure I understand it correctly. The sequence is called {a_n}, and they tell me that the first term, a₁, is 1. Then, they mention that the product of the second term and the fourth term, which is a₂ multiplied by a₄, equals 16. I need to find the seventh term, a₇.Alright, let's recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a₁ * r^(n-1).Given that a₁ is 1, that simplifies things a bit. So, the nth term becomes a_n = 1 * r^(n-1), which is just r^(n-1). So, a₂ would be r^(2-1) = r^1 = r, a₃ is r², a₄ is r³, and so on.Now, the problem states that a₂ * a₄ = 16. Let's write that out using the expressions we have:a₂ * a₄ = r * r³ = r⁴ = 16.So, r⁴ = 16. To find r, we can take the fourth root of both sides. The fourth root of 16 is 2 because 2⁴ = 16. But wait, hold on, 16 is positive, and when dealing with even roots, we have to consider both positive and negative roots. So, r could be 2 or -2.Hmm, so r can be either 2 or -2. That means we have two possible common ratios. Let me note that down.Case 1: r = 2Case 2: r = -2Now, I need to find a₇. Let's use the general formula again. Since a₁ = 1, a₇ = r^(7-1) = r⁶.So, regardless of whether r is 2 or -2, when we raise it to the 6th power, the result will be positive because any negative number raised to an even power becomes positive.Calculating for both cases:Case 1: r = 2a₇ = 2⁶ = 64Case 2: r = -2a₇ = (-2)⁶ = 64So, in both cases, a₇ is 64. Therefore, the seventh term is 64.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning:1. a₁ = 1, so the sequence is 1, r, r², r³, r⁴, r⁵, r⁶, etc.2. a₂ = r, a₄ = r³. Their product is r * r³ = r⁴ = 16.3. Solving for r, we get r = ±2.4. Then, a₇ is r⁶, which is (±2)⁶ = 64.Yes, that seems correct. So, whether the common ratio is positive or negative, the seventh term is 64.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I can confidently say that a₇ is 64.**Final Answer**The seventh term is boxed{64}."},{"question":"Find the smallest natural solution to the inequality (left(frac{2023}{2022}right)^{27+18+12+8+ldots+27 cdotleft(frac{2}{3}right)^{n}} > left(frac{2023}{2022}right)^{72}).","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: (left(frac{2023}{2022}right)^{27+18+12+8+ldots+27 cdotleft(frac{2}{3}right)^{n}} > left(frac{2023}{2022}right)^{72}). Hmm, the base of both sides is the same, which is (frac{2023}{2022}). Since this base is greater than 1, right? Because 2023 is bigger than 2022, so (frac{2023}{2022} > 1). I remember that when you have an inequality with the same base and the base is greater than 1, the direction of the inequality depends on the exponents. Specifically, if (a > 1), then (a^b > a^c) implies that (b > c). So, applying that here, since (frac{2023}{2022} > 1), the inequality (left(frac{2023}{2022}right)^{A} > left(frac{2023}{2022}right)^{B}) simplifies to (A > B), where (A) is the exponent on the left and (B) is the exponent on the right.So, in this case, (A) is the sum (27 + 18 + 12 + 8 + ldots + 27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n) and (B) is 72. Therefore, the inequality simplifies to:(27 + 18 + 12 + 8 + ldots + 27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n > 72).Alright, so now I need to figure out what this sum is. It looks like a geometric series. Let me check the terms: 27, 18, 12, 8, and so on. Each term is being multiplied by (frac{2}{3}) to get the next term. Let me verify:27 multiplied by (frac{2}{3}) is 18, right? Because (27 times frac{2}{3} = 18). Then 18 multiplied by (frac{2}{3}) is 12, and 12 multiplied by (frac{2}{3}) is 8, and so on. So yes, this is a geometric series with the first term (a = 27) and common ratio (r = frac{2}{3}).The general form of a geometric series is (S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + ldots + ar^{n}). So in this case, the sum is (S_n = 27 + 18 + 12 + 8 + ldots + 27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n).Wait, but the last term is (27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n). So, is this a finite geometric series with (n+1) terms? Because the first term is (27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^0 = 27), the second term is (27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^1 = 18), and so on, up to the ((n+1))th term, which is (27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n). So, the number of terms is (n + 1).But actually, looking back at the original expression, it's written as (27 + 18 + 12 + 8 + ldots + 27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n). So, the last term is (27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n), which is the ((n+1))th term. So, the number of terms is (n + 1).But wait, let me think again. If the first term is 27, which is (27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^0), then the next term is (27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^1), and so on, so the exponent in the last term is (n), which would imply that the number of terms is (n + 1). So, the sum is (S_{n} = 27 cdot frac{1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}}{1 - frac{2}{3}}). Wait, is that correct?Wait, the formula for the sum of a geometric series is (S = a cdot frac{1 - r^{k}}{1 - r}), where (k) is the number of terms. So, in this case, (a = 27), (r = frac{2}{3}), and the number of terms is (n + 1). So, the sum (S) is:(S = 27 cdot frac{1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}}{1 - frac{2}{3}}).Simplify the denominator: (1 - frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{3}). So, the sum becomes:(S = 27 cdot frac{1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}}{frac{1}{3}} = 27 cdot 3 cdot left(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}right) = 81 cdot left(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}right)).So, the sum (27 + 18 + 12 + 8 + ldots + 27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n) is equal to (81 cdot left(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}right)).Therefore, the inequality becomes:(81 cdot left(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}right) > 72).Let me write that out:(81 cdot left(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}right) > 72).I can divide both sides by 81 to simplify:(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} > frac{72}{81}).Simplify (frac{72}{81}): both numerator and denominator are divisible by 9. 72 ÷ 9 = 8, 81 ÷ 9 = 9. So, (frac{72}{81} = frac{8}{9}).So, the inequality becomes:(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} > frac{8}{9}).Subtract 1 from both sides:(- left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} > frac{8}{9} - 1).Compute (frac{8}{9} - 1): that's (-frac{1}{9}).So, the inequality is:(- left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} > -frac{1}{9}).Multiply both sides by -1. Remember, when you multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips.So, we get:(left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} < frac{1}{9}).So now, we have:(left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} < frac{1}{9}).We need to solve for (n). Since (n) is a natural number (I assume starting from 0 or 1? The problem says \\"smallest natural solution,\\" so probably starting from 1). Let me check the problem statement: it says \\"the smallest natural solution,\\" so natural numbers are positive integers, so (n = 1, 2, 3, ldots).So, we have to find the smallest (n) such that (left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} < frac{1}{9}).Let me write this as:(left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} < frac{1}{9}).To solve for (n), we can take logarithms on both sides. Since (frac{2}{3}) is less than 1, the function (left(frac{2}{3}right)^x) is decreasing, so the inequality will reverse when we take logarithms.But let me recall: if (0 < a < 1), then (a^b < a^c) implies (b > c) because the function is decreasing.So, since (frac{2}{3} < 1), the inequality (left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} < frac{1}{9}) implies that (n+1 > log_{frac{2}{3}} left(frac{1}{9}right)).So, (n + 1 > log_{frac{2}{3}} left(frac{1}{9}right)).Let me compute (log_{frac{2}{3}} left(frac{1}{9}right)). Using the change of base formula:(log_{frac{2}{3}} left(frac{1}{9}right) = frac{ln left(frac{1}{9}right)}{ln left(frac{2}{3}right)}).Compute (ln left(frac{1}{9}right) = ln(1) - ln(9) = 0 - ln(9) = -ln(9)).Similarly, (ln left(frac{2}{3}right) = ln(2) - ln(3)).So, putting it together:(log_{frac{2}{3}} left(frac{1}{9}right) = frac{-ln(9)}{ln(2) - ln(3)}).Simplify numerator and denominator:Note that (ln(9) = 2 ln(3)), so numerator is (-2 ln(3)).Denominator is (ln(2) - ln(3)).So, the expression becomes:(frac{-2 ln(3)}{ln(2) - ln(3)} = frac{-2 ln(3)}{-(ln(3) - ln(2))} = frac{-2 ln(3)}{-(ln(3) - ln(2))} = frac{2 ln(3)}{ln(3) - ln(2)}).So, (log_{frac{2}{3}} left(frac{1}{9}right) = frac{2 ln(3)}{ln(3) - ln(2)}).Let me compute this value numerically to get an idea.First, compute (ln(3)) and (ln(2)):(ln(3) approx 1.098612289)(ln(2) approx 0.693147181)So, numerator: (2 times 1.098612289 = 2.197224578)Denominator: (1.098612289 - 0.693147181 = 0.405465108)So, the value is approximately (2.197224578 / 0.405465108 ≈ 5.419).So, (log_{frac{2}{3}} left(frac{1}{9}right) ≈ 5.419).Therefore, (n + 1 > 5.419), so (n > 4.419).Since (n) is a natural number, the smallest integer greater than 4.419 is 5. Therefore, (n = 5).But let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with logarithms, especially with inequalities, it's good to check.Let me compute (left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}) for (n = 5):(left(frac{2}{3}right)^{6} = left(frac{2}{3}right)^6).Compute (left(frac{2}{3}right)^6):(left(frac{2}{3}right)^2 = frac{4}{9})(left(frac{4}{9}right)^3 = frac{64}{729})Wait, actually, (left(frac{2}{3}right)^6 = left(frac{2}{3}right)^2 times left(frac{2}{3}right)^4 = frac{4}{9} times frac{16}{81} = frac{64}{729}).Compute (frac{64}{729}) as a decimal: 64 ÷ 729 ≈ 0.08789.Compare to (frac{1}{9} ≈ 0.1111). So, 0.08789 < 0.1111, which is true. So, for (n = 5), (left(frac{2}{3}right)^6 ≈ 0.08789 < 0.1111).What about (n = 4): (left(frac{2}{3}right)^{5}).(left(frac{2}{3}right)^5 = frac{32}{243}).Compute 32 ÷ 243 ≈ 0.131687.Compare to (frac{1}{9} ≈ 0.1111). So, 0.131687 > 0.1111. Therefore, for (n = 4), (left(frac{2}{3}right)^5 ≈ 0.131687 > 0.1111), which does not satisfy the inequality.So, (n = 5) is indeed the smallest natural number where the inequality holds.But just to make sure, let me recap:We had the inequality:(left(frac{2023}{2022}right)^{S} > left(frac{2023}{2022}right)^{72}), where (S = 27 + 18 + 12 + 8 + ldots + 27 cdot left(frac{2}{3}right)^n).Since the base is greater than 1, this reduces to (S > 72).We found that (S = 81 cdot left(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}right)).So, (81 cdot left(1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1}right) > 72).Simplify to (1 - left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} > frac{8}{9}).Which leads to (left(frac{2}{3}right)^{n+1} < frac{1}{9}).Solving this, we found (n > 4.419), so the smallest natural number (n) is 5.Therefore, the smallest natural solution is (n = 5).**Final Answer**The smallest natural solution is boxed{5}."},{"question":"Given a triangle ( triangle ABC ) with circumradius ( R ), it is known that[frac{a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma}{a sin beta + b sin gamma + c sin alpha} = frac{a + b + c}{9R},]where ( a, b, c ) are the lengths of the sides of ( triangle ABC ), and ( alpha, beta, gamma ) are the measures of angles ( angle A, angle B, angle C ) respectively. Determine ( alpha, beta, gamma ).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this triangle problem here, and I need to figure out the measures of its angles α, β, and γ. The problem gives me a ratio involving the sides and angles of the triangle, and it relates this ratio to the perimeter divided by nine times the circumradius R. Let me write down what's given:[frac{a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma}{a sin beta + b sin gamma + c sin alpha} = frac{a + b + c}{9R}]Hmm, okay. So, the numerator is a combination of the sides multiplied by the cosines of their opposite angles, and the denominator is a combination of the sides multiplied by the sines of the other angles. The right side is the perimeter over 9R. I need to find the angles α, β, γ.First, let me recall some fundamental formulas related to triangles. I know that in any triangle, the Law of Sines holds:[frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{b}{sin beta} = frac{c}{sin gamma} = 2R]That's useful because it relates the sides to the sines of their opposite angles and the circumradius R. Maybe I can express a, b, c in terms of R and the sines of the angles.So, from the Law of Sines:[a = 2R sin alpha, quad b = 2R sin beta, quad c = 2R sin gamma]Okay, so I can substitute these expressions into the given equation. Let me try that.First, let's substitute a, b, c in the numerator:Numerator: ( a cos alpha + b cos beta + c cos gamma )Substituting:( 2R sin alpha cos alpha + 2R sin beta cos beta + 2R sin gamma cos gamma )Factor out 2R:( 2R (sin alpha cos alpha + sin beta cos beta + sin gamma cos gamma) )Similarly, the denominator is ( a sin beta + b sin gamma + c sin alpha )Substituting:( 2R sin alpha sin beta + 2R sin beta sin gamma + 2R sin gamma sin alpha )Factor out 2R:( 2R (sin alpha sin beta + sin beta sin gamma + sin gamma sin alpha) )So now, the entire left side of the equation becomes:[frac{2R (sin alpha cos alpha + sin beta cos beta + sin gamma cos gamma)}{2R (sin alpha sin beta + sin beta sin gamma + sin gamma sin alpha)}]The 2R cancels out from numerator and denominator, so we have:[frac{sin alpha cos alpha + sin beta cos beta + sin gamma cos gamma}{sin alpha sin beta + sin beta sin gamma + sin gamma sin alpha} = frac{a + b + c}{9R}]Now, let's compute the right side. Since a, b, c are expressed in terms of R and the sines of the angles, let's substitute those as well.Perimeter ( a + b + c = 2R (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma) )So, the right side becomes:[frac{2R (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)}{9R} = frac{2 (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)}{9}]So now, our equation is:[frac{sin alpha cos alpha + sin beta cos beta + sin gamma cos gamma}{sin alpha sin beta + sin beta sin gamma + sin gamma sin alpha} = frac{2 (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)}{9}]Hmm, okay. Let me denote S = sin α + sin β + sin γ, and P = sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin α, and Q = sin α cos α + sin β cos β + sin γ cos γ.So, the equation becomes:[frac{Q}{P} = frac{2S}{9}]So, 9Q = 2P S.I need to find a relationship between Q, P, and S.Let me recall that in a triangle, α + β + γ = π. So, perhaps we can use some trigonometric identities to relate these terms.Also, note that sin α cos α = (1/2) sin 2α, so Q = (1/2)(sin 2α + sin 2β + sin 2γ).Similarly, P is the sum of products of sines. Maybe I can express P in terms of other trigonometric identities.Wait, let me think about the sum of sines. Also, perhaps using product-to-sum formulas?Alternatively, maybe I can express Q and P in terms of the sides or other known quantities.Alternatively, perhaps considering that in a triangle, there are relationships between the sines and cosines of the angles.Wait, another thought: maybe if the triangle is equilateral, this equation holds? Let me test that.If the triangle is equilateral, then α = β = γ = π/3.Compute the left side:Numerator: 3 * (a cos α) = 3a cos(π/3) = 3a*(1/2) = (3a)/2Denominator: 3 * (a sin β) = 3a sin(π/3) = 3a*(√3/2) = (3√3 a)/2So, the ratio is ( (3a)/2 ) / ( (3√3 a)/2 ) = 1/√3Right side: (a + b + c)/(9R) = (3a)/(9R) = a/(3R)But in an equilateral triangle, R = a / (√3), so a/(3R) = a/(3*(a/√3)) = √3 / 3 = 1/√3So, both sides equal 1/√3. So, the equation holds for an equilateral triangle.Therefore, it's possible that the triangle is equilateral, so all angles are π/3.But is this the only solution? Maybe, maybe not. Let me check another case.Suppose the triangle is right-angled. Let's say γ = π/2, so α + β = π/2.Let me assign specific values. Let's take α = π/4, β = π/4, γ = π/2.Compute the left side:Numerator: a cos α + b cos β + c cos γIn a right-angled triangle, c is the hypotenuse, so c = √(a² + b²). But since α = β = π/4, it's an isosceles right-angled triangle, so a = b, c = a√2.So, cos α = cos β = √2/2, cos γ = 0.So, numerator: a*(√2/2) + a*(√2/2) + c*0 = a√2Denominator: a sin β + b sin γ + c sin αsin β = sin(π/4) = √2/2, sin γ = sin(π/2) = 1, sin α = √2/2So, denominator: a*(√2/2) + a*1 + c*(√2/2)But c = a√2, so:= a*(√2/2) + a + a√2*(√2/2)Simplify:= (a√2)/2 + a + (a*2)/2= (a√2)/2 + a + a= (a√2)/2 + 2aSo, denominator = 2a + (a√2)/2So, the ratio is numerator/denominator = (a√2) / (2a + (a√2)/2 ) = √2 / (2 + √2/2 ) = √2 / ( (4 + √2)/2 ) = (2√2)/(4 + √2)Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - √2):= (2√2)(4 - √2) / (16 - 2) = (8√2 - 2*2) / 14 = (8√2 - 4)/14 = (4√2 - 2)/7 ≈ (5.656 - 2)/7 ≈ 3.656/7 ≈ 0.522Now, compute the right side: (a + b + c)/(9R)In this triangle, a = b, c = a√2, so perimeter = 2a + a√2Circumradius R of a right-angled triangle is half the hypotenuse, so R = c/2 = (a√2)/2Thus, right side = (2a + a√2)/(9*(a√2)/2) = (2 + √2)/(9*(√2)/2) = (2 + √2)*2/(9√2) = (4 + 2√2)/(9√2)Multiply numerator and denominator by √2:= (4√2 + 4)/18 = (4(√2 + 1))/18 = (2(√2 + 1))/9 ≈ (2*2.414)/9 ≈ 4.828/9 ≈ 0.536Hmm, so the left side was approximately 0.522, and the right side is approximately 0.536. They are close but not equal. So, in this case, the equation doesn't hold exactly. So, the triangle isn't right-angled with angles π/4, π/4, π/2.Alternatively, maybe the triangle is isoceles but not equilateral? Let me test another case.Suppose α = β = π/4, γ = π - 2π/4 = π/2. Wait, that's the same as above. So, same result.Alternatively, suppose α = π/6, β = π/3, γ = π - π/6 - π/3 = π/2.So, a right-angled triangle with angles π/6, π/3, π/2.Compute the left side:Numerator: a cos α + b cos β + c cos γIn a 30-60-90 triangle, sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2.Let me take a = 1, b = √3, c = 2.cos α = cos(π/6) = √3/2, cos β = cos(π/3) = 1/2, cos γ = 0.So, numerator: 1*(√3/2) + √3*(1/2) + 2*0 = √3/2 + √3/2 = √3Denominator: a sin β + b sin γ + c sin αsin β = sin(π/3) = √3/2, sin γ = sin(π/2) = 1, sin α = sin(π/6) = 1/2So, denominator: 1*(√3/2) + √3*1 + 2*(1/2) = √3/2 + √3 + 1Simplify:√3/2 + √3 = (3√3)/2, so denominator = (3√3)/2 + 1Thus, ratio = √3 / ( (3√3)/2 + 1 ) = √3 / ( (3√3 + 2)/2 ) = 2√3 / (3√3 + 2 )Multiply numerator and denominator by (3√3 - 2):= 2√3*(3√3 - 2) / ( (3√3)^2 - (2)^2 ) = 2√3*(3√3 - 2) / (27 - 4) = 2√3*(3√3 - 2)/23Compute numerator:2√3*3√3 = 2*3*3 = 182√3*(-2) = -4√3So, numerator = 18 - 4√3Thus, ratio = (18 - 4√3)/23 ≈ (18 - 6.928)/23 ≈ 11.072/23 ≈ 0.481Right side: (a + b + c)/(9R)Perimeter = 1 + √3 + 2 = 3 + √3Circumradius R = c/2 = 1So, right side = (3 + √3)/(9*1) = (3 + √3)/9 ≈ (3 + 1.732)/9 ≈ 4.732/9 ≈ 0.526Again, the left side is approximately 0.481, right side ≈ 0.526. Not equal. So, equation doesn't hold here either.Hmm, so in both right-angled cases, the equation doesn't hold. So, maybe the only solution is the equilateral triangle.But let's think more generally. Maybe I can express Q and P in terms of S and other known quantities.We have:Q = sin α cos α + sin β cos β + sin γ cos γ = (1/2)(sin 2α + sin 2β + sin 2γ)And in a triangle, α + β + γ = π, so 2α + 2β + 2γ = 2π.So, sin 2α + sin 2β + sin 2γ = 4 sin α sin β sin γWait, is that correct? Let me recall the identity:In a triangle, sin 2α + sin 2β + sin 2γ = 4 sin α sin β sin γYes, that's a known identity. So, Q = (1/2)(4 sin α sin β sin γ) = 2 sin α sin β sin γSo, Q = 2 sin α sin β sin γSimilarly, P = sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin αSo, our equation is:[frac{2 sin alpha sin beta sin gamma}{sin alpha sin beta + sin beta sin gamma + sin gamma sin alpha} = frac{2 (sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma)}{9}]Simplify:Multiply both sides by denominator:2 sin α sin β sin γ = (2/9)(sin α + sin β + sin γ)(sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin α)Let me denote S = sin α + sin β + sin γ, and P = sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin α, and Q = sin α sin β sin γSo, equation becomes:2Q = (2/9) S PSimplify:Multiply both sides by 9/2:9Q = S PSo, 9 sin α sin β sin γ = (sin α + sin β + sin γ)(sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin α)Hmm, okay. So, 9Q = S PI need to find angles α, β, γ such that this holds.Let me consider the case when the triangle is equilateral, so α = β = γ = π/3.Compute S = 3 sin(π/3) = 3*(√3/2) = (3√3)/2Compute P = 3 sin(π/3) sin(π/3) = 3*(√3/2)^2 = 3*(3/4) = 9/4Compute Q = sin(π/3)^3 = (√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8So, 9Q = 9*(3√3)/8 = (27√3)/8S P = (3√3/2)*(9/4) = (27√3)/8So, 9Q = S P holds. So, equilateral triangle satisfies the condition.Is this the only case?Suppose the triangle is isoceles, say α = β ≠ γ. Let me see if it's possible.Let me let α = β = x, so γ = π - 2x.Compute S = 2 sin x + sin(π - 2x) = 2 sin x + sin 2xSimilarly, P = sin x sin x + sin x sin(π - 2x) + sin(π - 2x) sin x = sin²x + 2 sin x sin(2x)Similarly, Q = sin x sin x sin(π - 2x) = sin²x sin 2xSo, our equation is:9 sin²x sin 2x = (2 sin x + sin 2x)(sin²x + 2 sin x sin 2x)Let me compute both sides.First, left side: 9 sin²x sin 2xRight side: (2 sin x + sin 2x)(sin²x + 2 sin x sin 2x)Let me let t = sin x, and s = sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x = 2t cos xSo, let me express everything in terms of t.But maybe it's better to express in terms of x.Alternatively, let me denote u = sin x, v = sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x.Then, S = 2u + vP = u² + 2u vQ = u² vSo, equation becomes:9 Q = S P => 9 u² v = (2u + v)(u² + 2u v)Let me expand the right side:(2u + v)(u² + 2u v) = 2u*(u² + 2u v) + v*(u² + 2u v) = 2u³ + 4u² v + u² v + 2u v² = 2u³ + 5u² v + 2u v²So, equation is:9 u² v = 2u³ + 5u² v + 2u v²Bring all terms to left side:9u² v - 2u³ - 5u² v - 2u v² = 0Simplify:(9u² v - 5u² v) - 2u³ - 2u v² = 4u² v - 2u³ - 2u v² = 0Factor out 2u:2u(2u v - u² - v²) = 0So, either 2u = 0 => u = 0, which would mean sin x = 0, which is impossible in a triangle, or:2u v - u² - v² = 0So,2u v = u² + v²Bring all terms to one side:u² - 2u v + v² = 0Which is (u - v)^2 = 0 => u = vSo, sin x = sin 2xSo, sin x = sin 2xWhich implies that either:1. 2x = x + 2π n => x = 2π n, which is impossible since x is an angle in a triangle (0 < x < π)Or,2. 2x = π - x + 2π n => 3x = π + 2π n => x = π/3 + (2π/3) nSince x must be between 0 and π, possible solutions are x = π/3 or x = π/3 + 2π/3 = π, which is not possible.So, x = π/3.Thus, in the isoceles case, the only solution is x = π/3, which leads to γ = π - 2x = π - 2π/3 = π/3, so the triangle is equilateral.Therefore, in the isoceles case, only equilateral triangle satisfies the condition.What about scalene triangles? Maybe I can assume that all angles are different and see if it's possible.But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe the only solution is the equilateral triangle.Alternatively, let's consider using the AM ≥ GM inequality or other inequalities to see if equality holds only when all angles are equal.But perhaps another approach: since we have 9Q = S P, and in the equilateral case, this holds, maybe it's the only case.Alternatively, let's consider that in any triangle, the following inequality holds:sin α + sin β + sin γ ≤ (3√3)/2With equality if and only if the triangle is equilateral.Similarly, the product sin α sin β sin γ is maximized when the triangle is equilateral.But not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, let's consider substituting t = sin α, u = sin β, v = sin γ.But in a triangle, we have α + β + γ = π, so perhaps we can use some substitution.Alternatively, let me consider that in a triangle, we can express sin γ = sin(π - α - β) = sin(α + β)So, sin γ = sin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin βBut not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that in any triangle:sin α + sin β + sin γ = 4 cos(α/2) cos(β/2) cos(γ/2)And,sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin α = 1 + cos α + cos β + cos γWait, is that correct? Let me recall.Wait, actually, I think:sin α + sin β + sin γ = 4 cos(α/2) cos(β/2) cos(γ/2)And,sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin α = 1 + r/RWhere r is inradius and R is circumradius.But I'm not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of cosines.Wait, another identity: in any triangle,sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin α = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/(4R^2)Wait, let me check:From Law of Sines, a = 2R sin α, so sin α = a/(2R), similarly for sin β and sin γ.Thus,sin α sin β + sin β sin γ + sin γ sin α = (ab + bc + ca)/(4R^2)Similarly, sin α + sin β + sin γ = (a + b + c)/(2R)And, sin α sin β sin γ = (abc)/(8R^3)So, substituting into our equation:9Q = S PWhich is:9*(abc)/(8R^3) = ( (a + b + c)/(2R) )*( (ab + bc + ca)/(4R^2) )Simplify right side:= (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)/(8R^3)So, equation becomes:9*(abc)/(8R^3) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)/(8R^3)Multiply both sides by 8R^3:9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)So, 9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)Hmm, okay. So, now, the equation reduces to:9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)Let me denote this as:9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)I need to find the triangle where this holds.Let me consider that for an equilateral triangle, a = b = c, so let a = b = c = k.Then, left side: 9k^3Right side: (3k)(3k^2) = 9k^3So, equality holds.Now, is this the only case?Suppose the triangle is isoceles, a = b ≠ c.Let me set a = b = 1, c = t, where t is some positive number.Compute left side: 9abc = 9*1*1*t = 9tCompute right side: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (1 + 1 + t)(1*1 + 1*t + t*1) = (2 + t)(1 + 2t)So, equation becomes:9t = (2 + t)(1 + 2t)Expand right side:= 2*1 + 2*2t + t*1 + t*2t = 2 + 4t + t + 2t² = 2 + 5t + 2t²So, equation:9t = 2 + 5t + 2t²Bring all terms to left:2t² + 5t + 2 - 9t = 2t² - 4t + 2 = 0Divide by 2:t² - 2t + 1 = 0 => (t - 1)^2 = 0 => t = 1So, c = 1, which implies a = b = c, so equilateral triangle.Thus, in the isoceles case, only equilateral triangle satisfies the condition.What about scalene triangle? Let me assume a ≠ b ≠ c.But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using inequalities.Note that in any triangle, by AM ≥ GM,(a + b + c)/3 ≥ (abc)^(1/3)Similarly,(ab + bc + ca)/3 ≥ (a^2b^2c^2)^(1/3) = (abc)^(2/3)But not sure if that helps.Alternatively, let me consider the equation:9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)Let me divide both sides by abc:9 = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)/abcLet me denote x = a/b, y = b/c, z = c/a, but this might complicate.Alternatively, let me use substitution variables.Let me set p = a + b + c, q = ab + bc + ca, r = abc.So, equation is 9r = p qBut in any triangle, we have relationships between p, q, r.Wait, in any triangle, using R and r:We know that:p = a + b + c = 2s, where s is semi-perimeter.But not sure.Alternatively, perhaps using Heron's formula.But maybe another approach: Let me consider substituting a = 2R sin α, etc., back into the equation.Wait, we already did that earlier, leading to 9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)But perhaps another substitution.Wait, in any triangle, we have:cos α = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)Similarly for cos β and cos γ.But not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe using substitution variables x = a/b, y = b/c, z = c/a, but that might complicate.Alternatively, perhaps consider that in a triangle, the equation 9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) can be rewritten as:9 = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)/abcLet me denote u = a/b, v = b/c, w = c/a.But since u*v*w = 1, this might not help.Alternatively, let me consider that in a triangle, the sides must satisfy triangle inequalities, so maybe I can assume a ≤ b ≤ c, and see if the equation holds.But this might not be straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps consider that if 9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca), then:Let me write this as:9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)Let me expand the right side:= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)= a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + abc + b c² + c²aWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me do it properly.Wait, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)= a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + abc + bc² + c²aSo, grouping similar terms:= a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a + 3abcSo, equation becomes:9abc = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a + 3abcBring all terms to left:9abc - 3abc - (a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a) = 0Simplify:6abc - (a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a) = 0Factor:Let me factor terms:= a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a - 6abc = 0Hmm, seems symmetric but not sure.Alternatively, factor by grouping:= a²b + ab² - 2abc + a²c + ac² - 2abc + b²c + bc² - 2abc= ab(a + b - 2c) + ac(a + c - 2b) + bc(b + c - 2a)Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps factor as:= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 6abc= ab(a + b + c) + ac(a + c + b) + bc(b + c + a) - 6abc - 3abcWait, no, that's not helpful.Alternatively, perhaps factor as:= a b (a + b) + a c (a + c) + b c (b + c) - 6 a b cBut not sure.Alternatively, perhaps consider symmetric sums.Wait, let me denote S1 = a + b + c, S2 = ab + bc + ca, S3 = abc.Then, the equation is:6 S3 = S1 S2 - 3 S3Wait, no, from earlier:9 S3 = S1 S2So, 9 S3 = S1 S2But in our case, we have:6 S3 = S1 S2 - 3 S3Wait, no, earlier we had 9abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca), which is 9 S3 = S1 S2But in the expanded form, we had 9 S3 = S1 S2, which is consistent.Wait, but when I expanded, I got 9 S3 = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a + 3 S3, so moving 3 S3 to left:6 S3 = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²aSo, 6 S3 = sum_{sym} a²bHmm, in symmetric sum notation, sum_{sym} a²b = a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²aSo, 6 S3 = sum_{sym} a²bHmm, okay.In an equilateral triangle, a = b = c, so sum_{sym} a²b = 6 a³, and S3 = a³, so 6 S3 = 6 a³, which holds.But for a scalene triangle, does this hold?Suppose a = 2, b = 3, c = 4. Let's compute both sides.Left side: 6 S3 = 6*2*3*4 = 6*24 = 144Right side: sum_{sym} a²b = 2²*3 + 2²*4 + 3²*2 + 3²*4 + 4²*2 + 4²*3 = 4*3 + 4*4 + 9*2 + 9*4 + 16*2 + 16*3Compute:12 + 16 + 18 + 36 + 32 + 48 = 12 + 16 = 28; 28 + 18 = 46; 46 + 36 = 82; 82 + 32 = 114; 114 + 48 = 162So, 162 ≠ 144. So, equation doesn't hold.Another example: a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 (right-angled triangle)Left side: 6*3*4*5 = 6*60 = 360Right side: sum_{sym} a²b = 9*4 + 9*5 + 16*3 + 16*5 + 25*3 + 25*4Compute:36 + 45 + 48 + 80 + 75 + 100 = 36+45=81; 81+48=129; 129+80=209; 209+75=284; 284+100=384384 ≠ 360. So, equation doesn't hold.Another example: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 (equilateral)Left side: 6*1*1*1 = 6Right side: sum_{sym} a²b = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 6So, equality holds.Another example: a = 1, b = 1, c = 2 (isoceles but not equilateral)Left side: 6*1*1*2 = 12Right side: sum_{sym} a²b = 1*1 + 1*2 + 1*1 + 1*2 + 4*1 + 4*1 = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 1414 ≠ 12. So, equation doesn't hold.Thus, in all tested cases except equilateral, the equation doesn't hold. So, likely, the only solution is the equilateral triangle.Therefore, the angles are all π/3.**Final Answer**The measures of the angles are (boxed{dfrac{pi}{3}}), (boxed{dfrac{pi}{3}}), and (boxed{dfrac{pi}{3}})."},{"question":"Which number represents ten thousand?(A) 10(B) 10000000(C) 10000(D) 100(E) 1000","answer":"To determine which number represents ten thousand, I'll start by recalling the numerical values associated with each option.Option A is 10, which is ten.

According to the problem, L = 4T + 8.Given that 6 teas were sold, I can substitute T with 6 in the equation. So, L = 4 * 6 + 8.Calculating this, 4 times 6 is 24, and adding 8 gives a total of 32 lattes sold."},{"question":"A coin is tossed 10 times. Find the probability that two heads never appear consecutively.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a coin is tossed 10 times, and I need to find the probability that two heads never appear consecutively. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that when dealing with probability, especially with coins, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^n, where n is the number of tosses. Since the coin is tossed 10 times, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^10, which is 1024. So, that's the denominator of my probability.Now, the tricky part is figuring out the numerator, which is the number of favorable outcomes where two heads never appear consecutively. So, I need to count how many sequences of 10 coin tosses have no two heads in a row.I remember that this kind of problem is similar to something I've heard about in combinatorics, maybe related to Fibonacci numbers? Let me think. If I denote the number of valid sequences of length n as a_n, then maybe I can find a recurrence relation for a_n.Let's try to build up the solution. For a sequence of length 1, there are two possible outcomes: H or T. Both are valid because there's only one toss, so no chance of two heads in a row. So, a_1 = 2.For a sequence of length 2, the possible outcomes are HH, HT, TH, TT. Out of these, HH is invalid because it has two heads in a row. So, the valid sequences are HT, TH, TT. That's 3. So, a_2 = 3.Wait, so a_1 is 2, a_2 is 3. Hmm, that seems like the Fibonacci sequence. Let me check for n=3. For a sequence of length 3, how many valid sequences are there?Let's list them:1. TTT2. TTH3. THT4. THH (invalid)5. HTT6. HTH7. HHT (invalid)8. HHH (invalid)So, the valid sequences are TTT, TTH, THT, HTT, HTH. That's 5. So, a_3 = 5.Wait, that's 5, which is the next Fibonacci number after 3. So, it seems like a_n follows the Fibonacci sequence. Let me see:a_1 = 2a_2 = 3a_3 = 5a_4 = 8a_5 = 13a_6 = 21a_7 = 34a_8 = 55a_9 = 89a_10 = 144Wait, so a_10 is 144. So, the number of valid sequences is 144. Therefore, the probability is 144 / 1024.But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about the recurrence relation again. If I have a sequence of length n, how can I build it? The last toss can be either a T or an H. If it's a T, then the preceding n-1 tosses can be any valid sequence of length n-1. If it's an H, then the previous toss must be a T, and the preceding n-2 tosses can be any valid sequence of length n-2.So, the recurrence relation is a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}. That's the Fibonacci recurrence. And since a_1 = 2 and a_2 = 3, this is indeed the Fibonacci sequence starting from 2 and 3.So, for n=10, a_10 is 144. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 144.Therefore, the probability is 144 / 1024. Let me simplify that fraction.Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 144 ÷ 16 = 9, 1024 ÷ 16 = 64. So, it's 9/64.Wait, 9 times 16 is 144, and 64 times 16 is 1024. So, yes, 9/64 is the simplified form.But just to make sure, let me think again. Is a_n really following the Fibonacci sequence? Let me try n=4.a_4 should be a_3 + a_2 = 5 + 3 = 8.Let me list all valid sequences for n=4:1. TTTT2. TTTH3. TTHT4. THTT5. THTH6. HTTT7. HTTH8. HTHTThat's 8 sequences, which matches a_4 = 8. So, that seems correct.Similarly, for n=5, a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 8 + 5 = 13. Let me count them:Starting with T:- T followed by all valid sequences of length 4: 8 sequencesStarting with HT:- HT followed by all valid sequences of length 3: 5 sequencesTotal: 8 + 5 = 13. That works.Okay, so the pattern holds. Therefore, for n=10, a_10 is indeed 144.Therefore, the probability is 144 / 1024, which simplifies to 9 / 64.Wait, 144 divided by 16 is 9, and 1024 divided by 16 is 64. Yes, that's correct.So, the probability is 9/64.But just to double-check, let me think about another approach. Maybe using combinations.If I consider that no two heads are consecutive, then the number of heads can be at most 5, right? Because if you have 6 heads, you'd need at least 5 tails to separate them, but 6 + 5 = 11, which is more than 10. So, the maximum number of heads is 5.So, the number of valid sequences is the sum from k=0 to k=5 of C(n - k + 1, k), where n=10.Wait, that formula is for the number of ways to arrange k non-consecutive heads in n tosses.So, for each k from 0 to 5, the number of ways is C(10 - k + 1, k) = C(11 - k, k).So, let's compute that:For k=0: C(11, 0) = 1For k=1: C(10, 1) = 10For k=2: C(9, 2) = 36For k=3: C(8, 3) = 56For k=4: C(7, 4) = 35For k=5: C(6, 5) = 6Now, adding these up: 1 + 10 = 11, 11 + 36 = 47, 47 + 56 = 103, 103 + 35 = 138, 138 + 6 = 144.So, that's 144. So, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms that the number of favorable outcomes is indeed 144.Therefore, the probability is 144 / 1024, which simplifies to 9 / 64.So, I think that's the correct answer. I've approached it in two different ways: using the Fibonacci recurrence and using combinations, and both gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that 9/64 is the correct probability.**Final Answer**The probability is boxed{dfrac{9}{64}}."},{"question":"In my row in the theatre, the seats are numbered consecutively from T1 to T50.

In this case, the point is (-1, m), so I should substitute x with -1 and y with m in the equation.Let me write that down. The equation is y = x² + (a + 1)x + a. Substituting x = -1 and y = m, we get:m = (-1)² + (a + 1)(-1) + a.Okay, let me compute each term step by step. First, (-1) squared is 1. Then, (a + 1) multiplied by (-1) is... let me distribute that. So, (a)(-1) is -a, and (1)(-1) is -1. So, that term becomes -a - 1. Then, the last term is just +a.Putting it all together, m = 1 + (-a - 1) + a.Hmm, let me simplify that. So, 1 minus a minus 1 plus a. Let me rearrange the terms to make it clearer. The constants are 1 and -1, and the a terms are -a and +a.So, 1 - 1 is 0, and -a + a is also 0. Wait, does that mean m is 0? That seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.Starting again: m = (-1)² + (a + 1)(-1) + a.Compute each term:1. (-1)² = 1.2. (a + 1)(-1) = -a - 1.3. The last term is +a.So, adding them up: 1 + (-a - 1) + a.Let me group the constants and the a terms:Constants: 1 - 1 = 0.a terms: -a + a = 0.So, m = 0 + 0 = 0.Hmm, so m is 0. That seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.Alternatively, maybe I can factor the quadratic equation to see if that gives me any insights. The equation is y = x² + (a + 1)x + a.Let me try factoring it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to a and add up to (a + 1). Hmm, that might not be straightforward. Wait, actually, let me factor it.The quadratic is x² + (a + 1)x + a. Let me see if I can factor this as (x + something)(x + something else). Let's assume it factors into (x + c)(x + d). Then, c + d should be (a + 1), and c*d should be a.So, c + d = a + 1 and c*d = a. Let me solve for c and d.From c*d = a, let's say c = a and d = 1. Then, c + d = a + 1, which matches the middle term. Perfect! So, the quadratic factors as (x + a)(x + 1).So, y = (x + a)(x + 1). That's a nice factorization.Now, since the parabola passes through (-1, m), substituting x = -1 into the equation should give y = m.So, plugging x = -1 into y = (x + a)(x + 1):y = (-1 + a)(-1 + 1).Compute each part:First, (-1 + a) is (a - 1).Second, (-1 + 1) is 0.So, y = (a - 1)*0 = 0.Therefore, m = 0.Okay, so that confirms my earlier result. So, regardless of the value of a, when x is -1, y is 0. So, m must be 0.Wait, is that always the case? Let me test with a specific value of a to make sure.Suppose a = 2. Then, the equation becomes y = x² + (2 + 1)x + 2 = x² + 3x + 2.Factoring, that's (x + 1)(x + 2). Plugging x = -1, y = (-1 + 1)(-1 + 2) = (0)(1) = 0. So, m = 0.Another example: a = 0. Then, the equation is y = x² + (0 + 1)x + 0 = x² + x.Factoring, that's x(x + 1). Plugging x = -1, y = (-1)(0) = 0. So, m = 0 again.Wait, so regardless of a, when x is -1, y is 0? That seems to be the case. So, m is always 0, no matter what a is.That makes sense because when we factor the quadratic as (x + a)(x + 1), one of the roots is x = -1, which is the x-coordinate of the given point. So, when x is -1, y must be 0, which is the y-coordinate. Therefore, m is 0.So, after going through this step-by-step and checking with specific examples, I'm confident that m is 0.**Final Answer**The value of ( m ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Mianning Lingshan Temple is a national 4A-level tourist attraction and one of the most popular tourist attractions in Liangshan Prefecture. Lingshan Temple is renowned as \\"the first spirit in the world,\\" \\"the first mountain in southern Sichuan,\\" and \\"the first temple in western Sichuan,\\" and it is always bustling with incense all year round. The number of tourists visiting Lingshan Temple has been increasing rapidly year by year. According to statistics, the number of tourists visiting Lingshan Temple from 2021 to 2023 is shown in the table below:| Year   | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 ||--------|------|------|------|| Year Code x | 1 | 2 | 3 || Number of Tourists y (in 10,000 people) | 12 | 18 | 27 |Based on the above data, there are two function models to choose from for the annual number of tourists y at Lingshan Temple and the year code x (Note: the year code for 2020 is x=1, for 2021 is x=2, and so on): 1. y=ka^{x} (k>0, a>1)2. y=msqrt{x}+n (m>0)(1) Determine which function model is more appropriate (no calculation required, just give a brief explanation), and find the analytical expression of the chosen function model.(2) Approximately in which year will the annual number of tourists at Lingshan Temple be about 3 times the number of tourists in 2021? (Reference data: sqrt{2}approx1.41, sqrt{3}approx1.73, log{2}approx0.30, log{3}approx0.48)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about Lingshan Temple and the number of tourists visiting over the years. There are two function models given: one is an exponential function, y = k * a^x, and the other is a square root function, y = m * sqrt(x) + n. I need to figure out which model is more appropriate and then find the equation for the chosen model. Then, part two asks me to estimate the year when the number of tourists will be about three times the number in 2021.First, let me understand the data given. The table shows the number of tourists from 2020 to 2022, with year codes x=1, 2, 3, and the corresponding number of tourists y in ten thousands: 12, 18, 27. So, 2020 is x=1, 2021 is x=2, 2022 is x=3.Looking at the numbers: 12, 18, 27. Hmm, that seems like each year it's increasing by 50%? Because 12 * 1.5 = 18, and 18 * 1.5 = 27. So, the growth rate is consistent, which suggests an exponential model might fit well here. On the other hand, the square root model is a bit more linear in growth, but let me think.For the exponential model, y = k * a^x, if the growth rate is consistent, then it should fit perfectly. Let me check the ratios:From x=1 to x=2: 18 / 12 = 1.5From x=2 to x=3: 27 / 18 = 1.5So, the ratio is consistent, which is a good sign for an exponential model. That is, each year the number of tourists is multiplied by 1.5. So, this seems to fit the exponential model.For the square root model, y = m * sqrt(x) + n. Let's see if that could also fit. Let me plug in the values:For x=1: y = m * 1 + n = m + n = 12For x=2: y = m * sqrt(2) + n ≈ m * 1.41 + n = 18For x=3: y = m * sqrt(3) + n ≈ m * 1.73 + n = 27So, we have a system of equations:1. m + n = 122. 1.41m + n = 183. 1.73m + n = 27Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:(1.41m + n) - (m + n) = 18 - 120.41m = 6 => m = 6 / 0.41 ≈ 14.63Then, from equation 1: n = 12 - m ≈ 12 - 14.63 ≈ -2.63Hmm, that gives a negative n, which is problematic because the problem states m > 0, but doesn't specify n. However, in the context, y represents the number of tourists, which can't be negative. So, if n is negative, for x=1, y = m + n ≈ 14.63 - 2.63 = 12, which is okay. But for x=0, which would be 2019, y would be n ≈ -2.63, which is not meaningful. So, maybe the square root model isn't the best fit here, especially since we have a consistent growth rate.Therefore, the exponential model seems more appropriate because the growth rate is consistent each year, which is a hallmark of exponential growth. The square root model, while it can be fitted, results in a negative intercept, which doesn't make sense in this context, and the growth isn't as rapid as exponential.So, for part (1), I think the exponential model is more appropriate. Now, let's find the analytical expression.Given y = k * a^x.We have three points: (1,12), (2,18), (3,27).Since the growth factor is consistent, as we saw earlier, each year it's multiplied by 1.5. So, a = 1.5.So, let's verify:For x=1: y = k * 1.5^1 = 1.5k = 12 => k = 12 / 1.5 = 8So, the equation is y = 8 * (1.5)^x.Let me check for x=2: 8 * (1.5)^2 = 8 * 2.25 = 18, which matches.For x=3: 8 * (1.5)^3 = 8 * 3.375 = 27, which also matches.Perfect, so the exponential model fits perfectly here.So, part (1) is done: the exponential model is more appropriate, and the function is y = 8 * (1.5)^x.Now, part (2): Approximately in which year will the annual number of tourists be about 3 times the number in 2021?First, the number of tourists in 2021 is y=18 (in ten thousands). So, 3 times that is 54 (in ten thousands).We need to find x such that y = 54.Given the model y = 8 * (1.5)^x.So, 54 = 8 * (1.5)^xLet me solve for x.First, divide both sides by 8: (1.5)^x = 54 / 8 = 6.75So, (1.5)^x = 6.75We can take logarithms on both sides to solve for x.Taking log base 10:log((1.5)^x) = log(6.75)x * log(1.5) = log(6.75)So, x = log(6.75) / log(1.5)We need to compute this. Let's see, we have reference data: log2 ≈ 0.30, log3 ≈ 0.48.First, let's compute log(6.75). 6.75 is equal to 27/4, which is 27 divided by 4.Alternatively, 6.75 = 6 + 0.75 = 6 + 3/4.But maybe it's easier to express 6.75 as 27/4.So, log(27/4) = log(27) - log(4) = log(3^3) - log(2^2) = 3*log3 - 2*log2Given log3 ≈ 0.48, log2 ≈ 0.30So, 3*0.48 = 1.442*0.30 = 0.60Thus, log(27/4) = 1.44 - 0.60 = 0.84So, log(6.75) ≈ 0.84Now, log(1.5). Let me compute that.1.5 is 3/2, so log(3/2) = log3 - log2 ≈ 0.48 - 0.30 = 0.18Therefore, x ≈ 0.84 / 0.18 ≈ 4.666...So, x ≈ 4.666...Since x is the year code, where x=1 is 2020, x=2 is 2021, x=3 is 2022, so x=4 would be 2023, x=5 is 2024.So, x≈4.666 is between 2023 and 2024. Since 0.666 is roughly two-thirds, so approximately 4.666 is about 4 years and 8 months. So, starting from 2020 as x=1, x=4.666 would be 2020 + 3.666 years, which is approximately 2023.666, which is around September 2023.But since the problem is asking for the year, we can round it to the nearest whole year. Since 0.666 is closer to 0.666, which is two-thirds, so maybe 2024? Or perhaps 2023?Wait, let's think about it. If x=4 is 2023, and x=5 is 2024. So, x≈4.666 is 0.666 of the way from 2023 to 2024, which is roughly 8 months into 2024. So, depending on when the tourist count is measured, it could be considered as 2024.But maybe the question expects an integer year, so perhaps 2024.Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, fractional years are acceptable, but since it's asking for the year, probably 2024.But let me double-check my calculations.We had y = 8*(1.5)^x = 54So, 1.5^x = 6.75Taking natural logs: x = ln(6.75)/ln(1.5)But since we don't have ln values, we used log base 10.Wait, let me verify the log(6.75) computation.6.75 is 27/4, so log(27/4) = log27 - log4 = 3log3 - 2log2 ≈ 3*0.48 - 2*0.30 = 1.44 - 0.60 = 0.84. That seems correct.log(1.5) = log(3/2) = log3 - log2 ≈ 0.48 - 0.30 = 0.18. Correct.So, x ≈ 0.84 / 0.18 = 4.666...So, x ≈ 4.666, which is 4 and 2/3. So, 4 years and 8 months from x=1 (2020). So, 2020 + 4 years is 2024, and 8 months into 2024 would be around August 2024. So, if we're talking about annual counts, it's likely referring to the year when the count reaches 54, which would be in 2024.Alternatively, if we consider that the count increases continuously, it might cross 54 in 2024, so the answer is 2024.But let me think again. If x=4 is 2023, and x=5 is 2024, and x≈4.666 is 0.666 into the year 2024. So, the number of tourists in 2023 (x=4) would be y=8*(1.5)^4.Compute y at x=4: 8*(1.5)^4.(1.5)^2 = 2.25, so (1.5)^4 = (2.25)^2 = 5.0625.So, y=8*5.0625=40.5 (in ten thousands). So, 405,000 tourists.At x=5: y=8*(1.5)^5 = 8*(7.59375)=60.75 (in ten thousands). So, 607,500 tourists.Wait, but 3 times 18 is 54, which is 540,000.So, 54 is between x=4 and x=5. So, the exact x is 4.666, which is 2023.666, so approximately 2024.So, the answer is 2024.But let me check if I made any errors in the calculations.Wait, when I computed log(6.75) as 0.84, is that correct?Yes, because 6.75 is 27/4, and log(27) is 3*log(3)=1.44, log(4)=2*log(2)=0.60, so 1.44 - 0.60=0.84.Similarly, log(1.5)=0.18.So, x=0.84 / 0.18=4.666...Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, let me compute 1.5^4.666 and see if it's approximately 6.75.1.5^4 = 5.06251.5^5 = 7.59375So, 1.5^4.666 is between 5.0625 and 7.59375.Let me compute 1.5^(4 + 2/3) = 1.5^4 * 1.5^(2/3)1.5^4 = 5.06251.5^(2/3) is the cube root of (1.5^2) = cube root of 2.25 ≈ 1.3So, 5.0625 * 1.3 ≈ 6.581, which is close to 6.75. So, x≈4.666 is correct.Therefore, the year is approximately 2024.So, to recap:(1) The exponential model y = 8*(1.5)^x is more appropriate because the growth rate is consistent each year, fitting the exponential growth pattern.(2) The number of tourists will be about 3 times the 2021 count (which was 18, so 54) in approximately the year 2024.**Final Answer**(1) The exponential model is more appropriate, and its expression is boxed{y = 8 times (1.5)^x}.(2) The annual number of tourists will be about 3 times the 2021 number in approximately the year boxed{2024}."},{"question":"Find the maximum possible value of the GCD ((x + 2015y, y + 2015x)), given that (x) and (y) are coprime numbers.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum possible value of the GCD of (x + 2015y, y + 2015x), given that x and y are coprime. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, let me write down what I need to find: GCD(x + 2015y, y + 2015x). Since x and y are coprime, their GCD is 1. I wonder how that fact will help me here.I remember that GCD(a, b) can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, which involves subtracting multiples of one number from the other. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me denote a = x + 2015y and b = y + 2015x. So, I need to find GCD(a, b).Using the Euclidean algorithm, GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b). Let me compute a mod b. To do that, I need to express a in terms of b.So, a = x + 2015y and b = y + 2015x. Let me see if I can write a as some multiple of b plus a remainder. Let's try:a = (x + 2015y) = (y + 2015x) * k + r, where k is some integer and r is the remainder.But I'm not sure what k should be. Maybe I can manipulate the expressions differently. Let me subtract 2015 times b from a:a - 2015b = (x + 2015y) - 2015*(y + 2015x) = x + 2015y - 2015y - 2015^2 x = x - (2015^2)x = x(1 - 2015^2).So, a - 2015b = x(1 - 2015^2). Therefore, a = 2015b + x(1 - 2015^2). Hmm, that might not be directly helpful, but let's see.Alternatively, maybe I can express the GCD in terms of x and y. Let me denote d = GCD(a, b). Then d divides both a and b, so it must divide any linear combination of a and b. For example, d divides a - 2015b and d divides b - 2015a.Wait, let me compute a - 2015b and b - 2015a:a - 2015b = (x + 2015y) - 2015*(y + 2015x) = x + 2015y - 2015y - 2015^2 x = x - 2015^2 x = x(1 - 2015^2).Similarly, b - 2015a = (y + 2015x) - 2015*(x + 2015y) = y + 2015x - 2015x - 2015^2 y = y - 2015^2 y = y(1 - 2015^2).So, d divides both x(1 - 2015^2) and y(1 - 2015^2). Since x and y are coprime, GCD(x, y) = 1, so GCD(x(1 - 2015^2), y(1 - 2015^2)) = |1 - 2015^2| * GCD(x, y) = |1 - 2015^2| * 1 = |1 - 2015^2|.Therefore, d divides |1 - 2015^2|. Let me compute 2015^2. 2015 is 2000 + 15, so 2015^2 = (2000)^2 + 2*2000*15 + 15^2 = 4,000,000 + 60,000 + 225 = 4,060,225. Therefore, 1 - 2015^2 = -4,060,224, and the absolute value is 4,060,224.So, d divides 4,060,224. Therefore, the maximum possible value of d is 4,060,224, but we need to check if this is achievable given that x and y are coprime.Wait, but 4,060,224 is a pretty large number. Let me see if there exist coprime integers x and y such that GCD(x + 2015y, y + 2015x) = 4,060,224.Alternatively, maybe I can find a smaller d that divides 4,060,224 and is achievable. Let me think about the structure of d.Since d divides both a and b, and a = x + 2015y, b = y + 2015x, then d must divide any linear combination, such as a - 2015b and b - 2015a, which we already found to be x(1 - 2015^2) and y(1 - 2015^2). So, d divides both x(1 - 2015^2) and y(1 - 2015^2). Since x and y are coprime, d must divide (1 - 2015^2). So, the maximum possible d is the absolute value of (1 - 2015^2), which is 4,060,224.But we need to verify if there exist x and y coprime such that GCD(x + 2015y, y + 2015x) = 4,060,224.Let me try to find such x and y. Let me denote k = 2015. Then, we have:GCD(x + ky, y + kx) = GCD(x + ky, y + kx). Let me denote d = GCD(x + ky, y + kx). Then, as before, d divides (x + ky) - k*(y + kx) = x + ky - ky - k^2 x = x(1 - k^2). Similarly, d divides (y + kx) - k*(x + ky) = y + kx - kx - k^2 y = y(1 - k^2). So, d divides both x(1 - k^2) and y(1 - k^2). Since x and y are coprime, d divides (1 - k^2). Therefore, the maximum possible d is |1 - k^2| = k^2 - 1.So, in our case, k = 2015, so d_max = 2015^2 - 1 = 4,060,224.Now, to check if this is achievable, we need to find x and y such that GCD(x + 2015y, y + 2015x) = 4,060,224 and GCD(x, y) = 1.Let me set x + 2015y = 4,060,224 * m and y + 2015x = 4,060,224 * n, where m and n are integers such that GCD(m, n) = 1.But since x and y are coprime, perhaps m and n must satisfy some conditions.Alternatively, let me consider that if d = 4,060,224, then x + 2015y must be a multiple of d, and y + 2015x must also be a multiple of d. Let me write:x + 2015y = d * ay + 2015x = d * bwhere a and b are integers. Then, we can solve for x and y:From the first equation: x = d * a - 2015ySubstitute into the second equation: y + 2015*(d * a - 2015y) = d * bSimplify: y + 2015d * a - 2015^2 y = d * bFactor y: y(1 - 2015^2) + 2015d * a = d * bBut 1 - 2015^2 = -d, so:y*(-d) + 2015d * a = d * bDivide both sides by d:- y + 2015a = bSo, b = 2015a - yBut from the first equation, x = d * a - 2015y. Since x and y are coprime, we need to ensure that GCD(x, y) = 1.Let me try to choose a and y such that x and y are coprime. Let me set a = 1 for simplicity.Then, from b = 2015*1 - y, so b = 2015 - y.From the first equation: x = d * 1 - 2015y = d - 2015y.So, x = d - 2015y.Now, we need to choose y such that GCD(x, y) = 1.Let me choose y = 1. Then, x = d - 2015*1 = d - 2015.So, x = 4,060,224 - 2015 = 4,058,209.Now, check GCD(x, y) = GCD(4,058,209, 1) = 1, which is true.Therefore, with x = 4,058,209 and y = 1, we have:GCD(x + 2015y, y + 2015x) = GCD(4,058,209 + 2015*1, 1 + 2015*4,058,209).Compute x + 2015y = 4,058,209 + 2015 = 4,060,224.Compute y + 2015x = 1 + 2015*4,058,209.But 2015*4,058,209 is a multiple of d, so y + 2015x is also a multiple of d. Therefore, GCD(4,060,224, multiple of 4,060,224) = 4,060,224.Thus, the maximum possible value of the GCD is indeed 4,060,224.Wait, but let me double-check. If x = 4,058,209 and y = 1, then:x + 2015y = 4,058,209 + 2015 = 4,060,224.y + 2015x = 1 + 2015*4,058,209.But 2015*4,058,209 = 2015*(4,058,209). Let me compute 2015*4,058,209:But actually, I don't need the exact value because it's clear that 2015x is a multiple of 2015, and since x = d - 2015y, which is d - 2015*1, so 2015x = 2015*(d - 2015) = 2015d - 2015^2.But y + 2015x = 1 + 2015d - 2015^2.But 2015^2 = d + 1, so 2015d - 2015^2 = 2015d - (d + 1) = (2015d - d) - 1 = d*(2015 - 1) - 1 = d*2014 - 1.Wait, that might not be directly helpful. But regardless, y + 2015x is equal to 1 + 2015x, which is 1 + 2015*(d - 2015) = 1 + 2015d - 2015^2.But since d = 2015^2 - 1, 2015^2 = d + 1. So, substituting:1 + 2015d - (d + 1) = 1 + 2015d - d - 1 = (2015d - d) + (1 - 1) = d*(2015 - 1) + 0 = d*2014.So, y + 2015x = d*2014.Therefore, GCD(x + 2015y, y + 2015x) = GCD(d, d*2014) = d, since d divides d*2014.Hence, the GCD is indeed d = 4,060,224.Therefore, the maximum possible value is 4,060,224.But wait, let me check if there's a smaller d that could be larger. Wait, no, because d divides 4,060,224, and 4,060,224 is the largest divisor of itself. So, it's indeed the maximum.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it differently. Let me consider that since d divides both a and b, and a and b are linear combinations of x and y, which are coprime, then d must divide any combination, including x and y themselves. But since x and y are coprime, d must divide 1, but that contradicts d being 4,060,224. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because d divides x(1 - 2015^2) and y(1 - 2015^2), but since x and y are coprime, d must divide (1 - 2015^2). So, d can be as large as (1 - 2015^2), which is 4,060,224, but since d is positive, it's 4,060,224.Wait, but earlier I thought that d must divide 1, but that's not correct because d divides x*(something) and y*(something), but since x and y are coprime, d must divide the coefficients, which are (1 - 2015^2). So, that's why d can be as large as 4,060,224.Therefore, the maximum possible value is 4,060,224."},{"question":"Delores has some money. She buys a computer for 400 and a printer for 40.

Remy used 1 more gallon than 3 times the number of gallons that Roman used for his shower. Together the boys used 33 gallons of water.  How many gallons did Remy use?","answer":"First, I'll define a variable to represent the number of gallons Roman used for his shower. Let's let ( R ) be the number of gallons Roman used.According to the problem, Remy used 1 more gallon than three times the amount Roman used. So, Remy's usage can be expressed as ( 3R + 1 ).Together, the two boys used a total of 33 gallons. This means that the sum of Roman's and Remy's usage equals 33 gallons. I can set up the equation:[R + (3R + 1) = 33]Next, I'll simplify and solve for ( R ). Combining like terms gives:[4R + 1 = 33]Subtracting 1 from both sides:[4R = 32]Dividing both sides by 4:[R = 8]Now that I know Roman used 8 gallons, I can find out how many gallons Remy used by plugging ( R = 8 ) back into the expression for Remy's usage:[3(8) + 1 = 25]Therefore, Remy used 25 gallons of water."},{"question":"Calculate the value of (1-i)^2 cdot i.","answer":"I need to calculate the value of (1 - i) squared multiplied by i.

Combining like terms, the expression becomes -2i. Finally, I'll multiply this result by i, resulting in -2i². Since i squared is -1, this simplifies to 2."},{"question":"Given a, b in mathbb{R}, if 1+i is a root of the real-coefficient equation x^{2}+ax+b=0, where i is the imaginary unit, then a+b=____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given real numbers a and b, if 1 + i is a root of the quadratic equation x² + a x + b = 0, where i is the imaginary unit, then I need to find a + b. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for polynomials with real coefficients, if there's a complex root, its complex conjugate must also be a root. So, if 1 + i is a root, then 1 - i must also be a root. That makes sense because the coefficients are real, so the imaginary parts have to cancel out somehow.So, the quadratic equation has two roots: 1 + i and 1 - i. Now, since it's a quadratic equation, these are the only roots. So, I can use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients a and b to the sum and product of the roots.Vieta's formulas say that for a quadratic equation x² + p x + q = 0, the sum of the roots is -p, and the product of the roots is q. In our case, the equation is x² + a x + b = 0, so the sum of the roots should be -a, and the product should be b.Let me write that down:Sum of roots: (1 + i) + (1 - i) = 2. So, according to Vieta, this should equal -a. Therefore, 2 = -a, which means a = -2.Product of roots: (1 + i)(1 - i). Let me compute that. Multiplying these two complex numbers: (1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) + (i)(-i) = 1 - i + i - i². The -i and +i cancel out, so we have 1 - i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2. So, the product is 2, which equals b. Therefore, b = 2.So, now I have a = -2 and b = 2. Therefore, a + b = (-2) + 2 = 0.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, the sum of the roots: (1 + i) + (1 - i) = 2. That seems right because the imaginary parts cancel out. So, sum is 2, which is equal to -a, so a is -2. That seems correct.Now, the product: (1 + i)(1 - i). Let me compute it again. Using the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Here, a is 1 and b is i, so it's 1² - (i)² = 1 - (-1) = 2. Yep, that's correct. So, product is 2, which is equal to b. So, b is 2.Therefore, a + b is (-2) + 2, which is indeed 0. Hmm, that seems straightforward.Alternatively, I can plug the root into the equation and solve for a and b. Let me try that method as a verification.Given that 1 + i is a root, plugging it into the equation x² + a x + b = 0 should satisfy the equation.So, let's compute (1 + i)² + a(1 + i) + b = 0.First, compute (1 + i)²: (1)^2 + 2*(1)*(i) + (i)^2 = 1 + 2i + (-1) = 0 + 2i = 2i.Then, a*(1 + i) = a + a i.Adding b, the entire expression becomes: 2i + a + a i + b = 0.Now, let's group the real and imaginary parts:Real parts: a + b.Imaginary parts: 2i + a i = (2 + a)i.Since the equation equals zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. So, we have two equations:1. Real part: a + b = 0.2. Imaginary part: 2 + a = 0.From the second equation, 2 + a = 0 => a = -2.Substituting a = -2 into the first equation: (-2) + b = 0 => b = 2.So, again, we get a = -2 and b = 2, so a + b = 0.That's consistent with what I found earlier using Vieta's formulas. So, that's a good check.Just to make sure, let me write out the quadratic equation with a = -2 and b = 2 and see if 1 + i is indeed a root.The equation becomes x² - 2x + 2 = 0.Let's plug in x = 1 + i:(1 + i)² - 2*(1 + i) + 2.Compute (1 + i)²: 1 + 2i + i² = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.Compute -2*(1 + i): -2 - 2i.Add 2: 2i - 2 - 2i + 2 = (2i - 2i) + (-2 + 2) = 0 + 0 = 0.Yes, it satisfies the equation. So, that's correct.Alternatively, if I factor the quadratic equation x² - 2x + 2, it should factor into (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).Let me multiply that out:(x - 1 - i)(x - 1 + i) = [(x - 1) - i][(x - 1) + i] = (x - 1)^2 - (i)^2.Compute (x - 1)^2: x² - 2x + 1.Subtract (i)^2: x² - 2x + 1 - (-1) = x² - 2x + 1 + 1 = x² - 2x + 2.Which matches our equation. So, that's another confirmation.Therefore, I'm confident that a = -2 and b = 2, so a + b = 0.**Final Answer**The value of (a + b) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Find the Green's function for the boundary value problemy^{prime prime}(x) + k^{2} y = 0, quad y(0)=y(1)=0","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the Green's function for the boundary value problem:y''(x) + k^{2} y = 0, quad y(0)=y(1)=0Hmm, okay. I remember that Green's functions are used to solve nonhomogeneous differential equations with specific boundary conditions. They kind of act like a kernel that, when convolved with the source term, gives the solution. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so I need to think this through carefully.First, I recall that for a linear differential equation like this, the Green's function satisfies the same differential equation but with a Dirac delta function as the source term. So, the Green's function ( G(x, s) ) satisfies:G''(x, s) + k^{2} G(x, s) = delta(x - s)subject to the boundary conditions ( G(0, s) = 0 ) and ( G(1, s) = 0 ).Okay, so the Green's function is a function of ( x ) and ( s ), and it's zero at the boundaries ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 1 ). Also, it has a delta function at ( x = s ), which means it has a discontinuity in its first derivative there.I think the strategy is to construct ( G(x, s) ) piecewise, meaning it will have different expressions for ( x < s ) and ( x > s ). Each piece will satisfy the homogeneous equation ( G'' + k^2 G = 0 ), and we'll match them at ( x = s ) with the appropriate jump conditions.So, let's break it down. For ( x neq s ), the equation is homogeneous, so the general solution is:G(x, s) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)But since ( G(0, s) = 0 ), plugging ( x = 0 ) into this expression gives:G(0, s) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0So, ( B = 0 ), which simplifies the solution to:G(x, s) = A sin(kx)But wait, this is only for ( x neq s ). Actually, we need to consider two separate regions: ( x < s ) and ( x > s ). So, let me denote the coefficients for each region.For ( x < s ), let's say:G_1(x, s) = A_1 sin(kx)And for ( x > s ):G_2(x, s) = A_2 sin(kx)But hold on, both expressions are similar, but they might have different coefficients because the delta function introduces a discontinuity in the derivative. So, we need to determine ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) such that the boundary conditions are satisfied and the jump conditions at ( x = s ) are correct.Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake here. The general solution for each region should include both sine and cosine terms, but the boundary conditions will eliminate some constants. Let me correct that.For ( x < s ), the general solution is:G_1(x, s) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)But since ( G(0, s) = 0 ), plugging ( x = 0 ) gives:G_1(0, s) = A sin(0) + B cos(0) = B = 0So, ( B = 0 ), and thus:G_1(x, s) = A sin(kx)Similarly, for ( x > s ), the general solution is:G_2(x, s) = C sin(kx) + D cos(kx)But since ( G(1, s) = 0 ), plugging ( x = 1 ) gives:G_2(1, s) = C sin(k) + D cos(k) = 0So, that's one equation involving ( C ) and ( D ). But we need another condition to solve for both constants. That comes from the continuity of ( G(x, s) ) at ( x = s ) and the jump condition in its derivative.So, let's write down the continuity condition:G_1(s, s) = G_2(s, s)Which gives:A sin(ks) = C sin(ks) + D cos(ks)And the jump condition for the derivative comes from integrating the differential equation across ( x = s ). The integral of ( G'' + k^2 G ) from ( s - epsilon ) to ( s + epsilon ) is equal to the integral of the delta function, which is 1. So, taking the limit as ( epsilon to 0 ), we get:G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) = 1Calculating the derivatives:( G'_1(x, s) = A k cos(kx) )( G'_2(x, s) = C k cos(kx) - D k sin(kx) )So, at ( x = s ):C k cos(ks) - D k sin(ks) - A k cos(ks) = 1Simplify:k (C - A) cos(ks) - k D sin(ks) = 1So, now we have three equations:1. ( G_1(s, s) = G_2(s, s) ): ( A sin(ks) = C sin(ks) + D cos(ks) )2. ( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) = 1 ): ( k (C - A) cos(ks) - k D sin(ks) = 1 )3. Boundary condition at ( x = 1 ): ( C sin(k) + D cos(k) = 0 )So, let's write these equations more clearly:Equation 1: ( A sin(ks) = C sin(ks) + D cos(ks) )Equation 2: ( k (C - A) cos(ks) - k D sin(ks) = 1 )Equation 3: ( C sin(k) + D cos(k) = 0 )Our unknowns are ( A ), ( C ), and ( D ). So, we have three equations and three unknowns, which is good.Let me try to solve these equations step by step.First, from Equation 3:( C sin(k) + D cos(k) = 0 )We can express ( C ) in terms of ( D ):( C = -D frac{cos(k)}{sin(k)} = -D cot(k) )So, ( C = -D cot(k) )Now, let's substitute ( C ) into Equation 1:Equation 1: ( A sin(ks) = C sin(ks) + D cos(ks) )Substitute ( C = -D cot(k) ):( A sin(ks) = (-D cot(k)) sin(ks) + D cos(ks) )Factor out ( D ):( A sin(ks) = D [ -cot(k) sin(ks) + cos(ks) ] )Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:( -cot(k) sin(ks) + cos(ks) = -frac{cos(k)}{sin(k)} sin(ks) + cos(ks) )Hmm, perhaps we can factor this expression. Let me see:Let me write ( sin(ks) ) and ( cos(ks) ) in terms of exponentials or use some trigonometric identities, but maybe it's better to just keep it as is for now.So, we have:( A sin(ks) = D [ -frac{cos(k)}{sin(k)} sin(ks) + cos(ks) ] )Let me factor out ( frac{1}{sin(k)} ):( A sin(ks) = D left( frac{ -cos(k) sin(ks) + sin(k) cos(ks) }{ sin(k) } right ) )Notice that the numerator is ( -cos(k) sin(ks) + sin(k) cos(ks) ), which resembles the sine of a difference:Recall that ( sin(a - b) = sin a cos b - cos a sin b ). So, if we have ( sin(k) cos(ks) - cos(k) sin(ks) = sin(k - ks) = sin(k(1 - s)) )So, the numerator is ( sin(k(1 - s)) ). Therefore, we have:( A sin(ks) = D frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k) } )So, solving for ( D ):( D = A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )But let's write it as:( D = A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )Wait, let me double-check that step. The numerator was ( sin(k(1 - s)) ), so:( A sin(ks) = D frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k) } )Therefore, solving for ( D ):( D = A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )Yes, that seems correct.So, now we have expressions for ( C ) and ( D ) in terms of ( A ). Let's substitute these into Equation 2 to solve for ( A ).Equation 2: ( k (C - A) cos(ks) - k D sin(ks) = 1 )First, substitute ( C = -D cot(k) ) and ( D = A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )So, let's compute each term.First, ( C - A = (-D cot(k)) - A = -D cot(k) - A )Substitute ( D = A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } ):( C - A = - A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } cot(k) - A )Simplify ( cot(k) = frac{cos(k)}{sin(k)} ):( C - A = - A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } cdot frac{cos(k)}{sin(k)} - A )Simplify:( C - A = - A frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } - A )Factor out ( -A ):( C - A = -A left( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + 1 right ) )Similarly, the term ( -k D sin(ks) ):Substitute ( D = A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } ):( -k D sin(ks) = -k A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } sin(ks) )Simplify:( -k D sin(ks) = -k A frac{ sin^2(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )So, putting it all together into Equation 2:( k (C - A) cos(ks) - k D sin(ks) = 1 )Substitute the expressions:( k left[ -A left( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + 1 right ) right ] cos(ks) - k A frac{ sin^2(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } = 1 )Let me factor out the ( -k A ):( -k A left[ left( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + 1 right ) cos(ks) + frac{ sin^2(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } right ] = 1 )Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:First term: ( left( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + 1 right ) cos(ks) )Second term: ( frac{ sin^2(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )Let me compute each part step by step.Compute the first term:( left( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + 1 right ) cos(ks) )Multiply out:( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) cos(ks) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + cos(ks) )Similarly, the second term is:( frac{ sin^2(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )So, combining both terms:Total expression inside the brackets:( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) cos(ks) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + cos(ks) + frac{ sin^2(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )Let me combine the first and third terms since they have the same denominator:( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) cos(ks) + sin^2(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + cos(ks) )Factor ( sin(ks) ) from the numerator:( frac{ sin(ks) [ cos(k) cos(ks) + sin(ks) sin(k) ] }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + cos(ks) )Notice that the expression inside the brackets is ( cos(k - ks) ) because ( cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B ). So, ( cos(k - ks) = cos(k(1 - s)) ).Therefore, the numerator becomes ( sin(ks) cos(k(1 - s)) ), so:( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + cos(ks) )Simplify the first term:( frac{ sin(ks) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } cos(k(1 - s)) )Which is ( sin(ks) cot(k(1 - s)) ), but maybe it's better to leave it as is for now.So, the total expression inside the brackets is:( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + cos(ks) )Let me write this as:( sin(ks) cot(k(1 - s)) + cos(ks) )Hmm, maybe we can combine these terms. Let me see.Let me denote ( theta = k(1 - s) ), so ( cot(theta) = frac{cos(theta)}{sin(theta)} ). So, ( sin(ks) cot(theta) = frac{sin(ks) cos(theta)}{sin(theta)} ).But ( ks = k(1 - (1 - s)) = k - k(1 - s) = k - theta ). So, ( sin(ks) = sin(k - theta) = sin(k) cos(theta) - cos(k) sin(theta) ).Therefore, ( sin(ks) cot(theta) = [ sin(k) cos(theta) - cos(k) sin(theta) ] cdot frac{cos(theta)}{sin(theta)} )Simplify:( sin(k) frac{cos^2(theta)}{sin(theta)} - cos(k) cos(theta) )So, the entire expression inside the brackets becomes:( sin(k) frac{cos^2(theta)}{sin(theta)} - cos(k) cos(theta) + cos(ks) )But ( cos(ks) = cos(k - theta) = cos(k) cos(theta) + sin(k) sin(theta) )So, substituting back:( sin(k) frac{cos^2(theta)}{sin(theta)} - cos(k) cos(theta) + cos(k) cos(theta) + sin(k) sin(theta) )Simplify:The ( - cos(k) cos(theta) ) and ( + cos(k) cos(theta) ) cancel out.So, we have:( sin(k) frac{cos^2(theta)}{sin(theta)} + sin(k) sin(theta) )Factor out ( sin(k) ):( sin(k) left( frac{cos^2(theta)}{sin(theta)} + sin(theta) right ) )Combine the terms inside the parentheses:( frac{cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta)}{sin(theta)} = frac{1}{sin(theta)} )Because ( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1 ).Therefore, the entire expression inside the brackets simplifies to:( sin(k) cdot frac{1}{sin(theta)} = frac{sin(k)}{sin(k(1 - s))} )Because ( theta = k(1 - s) ).So, putting it all together, the expression inside the brackets is ( frac{sin(k)}{sin(k(1 - s))} ).Therefore, going back to the equation:( -k A cdot frac{sin(k)}{sin(k(1 - s))} = 1 )So, solving for ( A ):( -k A cdot frac{sin(k)}{sin(k(1 - s))} = 1 )Multiply both sides by ( -1 ):( k A cdot frac{sin(k)}{sin(k(1 - s))} = -1 )Therefore,( A = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )So, ( A = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )Now, let's recall that ( D = A frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )Substitute ( A ):( D = left( - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } right ) cdot frac{ sin(ks) sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )Simplify:The ( sin(k(1 - s)) ) cancels out, and ( sin(k) ) cancels with ( sin(k) ):( D = - frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } )Similarly, ( C = -D cot(k) ), so:( C = - left( - frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } right ) cot(k) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } cot(k) )Simplify ( cot(k) = frac{cos(k)}{sin(k)} ):( C = frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ k sin(k) } )So, now we have expressions for ( A ), ( C ), and ( D ):- ( A = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )- ( C = frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ k sin(k) } )- ( D = - frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } )Now, let's write down the expressions for ( G_1(x, s) ) and ( G_2(x, s) ).For ( x < s ):( G_1(x, s) = A sin(kx) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } sin(kx) )For ( x > s ):( G_2(x, s) = C sin(kx) + D cos(kx) = frac{ sin(ks) cos(k) }{ k sin(k) } sin(kx) - frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } cos(kx) )Let me factor out ( frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } ) from ( G_2(x, s) ):( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } left( frac{ cos(k) }{ sin(k) } sin(kx) - cos(kx) right ) )Simplify ( frac{ cos(k) }{ sin(k) } = cot(k) ):( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } left( cot(k) sin(kx) - cos(kx) right ) )Let me see if I can write this in terms of sine functions. Recall that ( cot(k) sin(kx) - cos(kx) ) can be expressed as ( frac{ cos(k) sin(kx) - sin(k) cos(kx) }{ sin(k) } ), which is ( frac{ sin(kx - k) }{ sin(k) } ) by the sine subtraction formula.Yes, because ( sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B ). So, ( sin(kx - k) = sin(kx) cos(k) - cos(kx) sin(k) ).Therefore,( cot(k) sin(kx) - cos(kx) = frac{ sin(kx - k) }{ sin(k) } )So, substituting back into ( G_2(x, s) ):( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } cdot frac{ sin(kx - k) }{ sin(k) } = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(x - 1)) }{ k sin(k) } )Wait, because ( kx - k = k(x - 1) ), so ( sin(kx - k) = sin(k(x - 1)) ). Alternatively, ( sin(k(x - 1)) = -sin(k(1 - x)) ), but maybe it's better to keep it as is.So, putting it all together, the Green's function is:For ( x < s ):( G(x, s) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } sin(kx) )For ( x > s ):( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(x - 1)) }{ k sin(k) } )Wait, let me check the sign in ( G_2(x, s) ). Earlier, I had:( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } left( cot(k) sin(kx) - cos(kx) right ) )Which became:( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(x - 1)) }{ k sin(k) } )But let me verify the sign. Since ( sin(kx - k) = -sin(k - kx) = -sin(k(1 - x)) ). So, ( sin(k(x - 1)) = -sin(k(1 - x)) ). Therefore, ( G_2(x, s) = - frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(1 - x)) }{ k sin(k) } )But wait, in our earlier substitution, we had:( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k } cdot frac{ sin(kx - k) }{ sin(k) } )Which is ( frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(x - 1)) }{ k sin(k) } ), but ( sin(k(x - 1)) = -sin(k(1 - x)) ). So, it's equivalent to:( - frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(1 - x)) }{ k sin(k) } )But let me think about the overall expression. Since ( x > s ), ( 1 - x ) is negative, but sine is an odd function, so ( sin(k(1 - x)) = -sin(k(x - 1)) ). So, perhaps it's better to write it as ( sin(k(x - 1)) ) without the negative sign.But regardless, let's see if we can write the Green's function in a more symmetric form.Alternatively, perhaps we can write both parts in terms of ( sin(kx) ) and ( sin(k(1 - x)) ).Wait, another approach is to note that the Green's function can be written as:( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(kx) sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } ) for ( x < s )and( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(1 - x)) }{ k sin(k) } ) for ( x > s )But wait, in our earlier calculation, for ( x < s ), we had a negative sign:( G(x, s) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } sin(kx) )But that negative sign seems concerning because Green's functions are typically positive in certain contexts, but in this case, since the equation is oscillatory, the Green's function can have alternating signs.Wait, let me check the calculations again. When we solved for ( A ), we had:( A = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )So, ( G_1(x, s) = A sin(kx) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } sin(kx) )But when I look at the expression for ( G_2(x, s) ), it's positive:( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(x - 1)) }{ k sin(k) } )But ( sin(k(x - 1)) = -sin(k(1 - x)) ), so:( G_2(x, s) = - frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(1 - x)) }{ k sin(k) } )So, perhaps I should write both expressions with the same denominator and see if they can be combined.Alternatively, perhaps I made a sign error in the expression for ( G_2(x, s) ). Let me go back to the expression:After simplifying, we had:( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(x - 1)) }{ k sin(k) } )But ( sin(k(x - 1)) = sin(kx - k) = sin(kx)cos(k) - cos(kx)sin(k) ), which is consistent with our earlier steps.But let me think about the behavior of the Green's function. At ( x = 0 ), ( G(0, s) = 0 ), and at ( x = 1 ), ( G(1, s) = 0 ). Also, the Green's function should be continuous at ( x = s ), and the derivative should have a jump discontinuity of 1/k.Wait, let me check the continuity at ( x = s ):For ( x < s ), ( G_1(s, s) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } sin(ks) )For ( x > s ), ( G_2(s, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(s - 1)) }{ k sin(k) } )But ( sin(k(s - 1)) = -sin(k(1 - s)) ), so:( G_2(s, s) = frac{ sin(ks) (-sin(k(1 - s))) }{ k sin(k) } = - frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )Which is equal to ( G_1(s, s) ), so continuity is satisfied.Now, let's check the jump condition for the derivative.Compute ( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) ):First, ( G'_1(x, s) = A k cos(kx) )At ( x = s ):( G'_1(s, s) = A k cos(ks) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k) } cos(ks) )Similarly, ( G'_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k sin(k) } cdot k cos(k(x - 1)) cdot 1 )Wait, let me compute the derivative correctly.Wait, ( G_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(x - 1)) }{ k sin(k) } )So, derivative with respect to ( x ):( G'_2(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k sin(k) } cdot k cos(k(x - 1)) cdot 1 = frac{ sin(ks) }{ sin(k) } cos(k(x - 1)) )At ( x = s ):( G'_2(s, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ sin(k) } cos(k(s - 1)) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ sin(k) } cos(k(1 - s)) ) because ( cos(k(s - 1)) = cos(k(1 - s)) )So, ( G'_2(s, s) = frac{ sin(ks) cos(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k) } )Similarly, ( G'_1(s, s) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k) } cos(ks) )Therefore, the jump condition:( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) = frac{ sin(ks) cos(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k) } - left( - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) cos(ks) }{ sin(k) } right ) )Simplify:( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k(1 - s)) + sin(k(1 - s)) cos(ks) }{ sin(k) } )Notice that the numerator is ( sin(ks + k(1 - s)) = sin(k) ), because ( sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B ). So, ( sin(ks + k(1 - s)) = sin(k) )Therefore, the numerator is ( sin(k) ), so:( frac{ sin(k) }{ sin(k) } = 1 )Which satisfies the jump condition ( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) = 1 ). Perfect, that checks out.So, now, to write the Green's function in a compact form, we can express it as:For ( x < s ):( G(x, s) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) sin(kx) }{ k sin(k) } )For ( x > s ):( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(1 - x)) }{ k sin(k) } )Alternatively, we can write it using the minimum and maximum functions, but I think it's clearer to keep it piecewise.But let me see if I can write it in a more symmetric way. Notice that ( sin(k(1 - x)) = sin(k - kx) = sin(kx) cos(k) - cos(kx) sin(k) ), but that might not help much.Alternatively, since ( sin(k(1 - x)) = sin(k - kx) = sin(kx - k + pi) ) or something, but perhaps it's not necessary.Wait, another approach is to note that the Green's function can be written as:( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(k min(x, s)) sin(k(1 - max(x, s))) }{ k sin(k) } )Yes, that's a common way to express Green's functions for such boundary value problems. Let me verify.For ( x < s ), ( min(x, s) = x ), ( max(x, s) = s ), so:( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(kx) sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )But in our earlier expression, it's negative. Hmm, so perhaps there's a sign difference.Wait, in our case, for ( x < s ), ( G(x, s) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) sin(kx) }{ k sin(k) } ), which is negative of the expression above.Similarly, for ( x > s ), ( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(1 - x)) }{ k sin(k) } ), which is the same as the expression with ( min ) and ( max ).So, perhaps the standard form includes an absolute value or a sign based on the ordering of ( x ) and ( s ). Alternatively, perhaps I made a sign error in the earlier steps.Wait, let me think about the general form of the Green's function for this type of problem. For the equation ( y'' + k^2 y = 0 ) with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the Green's function is typically given by:( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(kx) sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } ) for ( x < s )and( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) sin(k(1 - x)) }{ k sin(k) } ) for ( x > s )But in our case, for ( x < s ), we have a negative sign. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.Wait, let's go back to the expression for ( A ). We had:( A = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )But in the standard Green's function, the coefficient for ( x < s ) is positive. So, perhaps I made a sign error in the calculation.Let me retrace the steps.When we solved for ( A ), we had:( -k A cdot frac{sin(k)}{sin(k(1 - s))} = 1 )So,( -k A cdot frac{sin(k)}{sin(k(1 - s))} = 1 )Therefore,( A = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )So, the negative sign is correct. Therefore, the Green's function for ( x < s ) is negative.But in the standard Green's function, it's positive. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.Wait, let me think about the differential equation. The equation is ( G'' + k^2 G = delta(x - s) ). So, the Green's function satisfies this equation.But when I integrated across ( x = s ), I got:( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) = 1 )But in some references, the jump condition is ( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) = 1/k ) or something else, depending on the equation.Wait, let's double-check the jump condition.The differential equation is:( G'' + k^2 G = delta(x - s) )Multiply both sides by 1 (no factor), so integrating from ( s - epsilon ) to ( s + epsilon ):( int_{s - epsilon}^{s + epsilon} G'' dx + k^2 int_{s - epsilon}^{s + epsilon} G dx = int_{s - epsilon}^{s + epsilon} delta(x - s) dx )The right-hand side is 1.The first integral on the left is ( G'(s + epsilon) - G'(s - epsilon) ), which as ( epsilon to 0 ) becomes ( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) ).The second integral on the left is ( k^2 int_{s - epsilon}^{s + epsilon} G dx ), which as ( epsilon to 0 ) tends to ( k^2 G(s, s) cdot 0 ) (since the interval length goes to zero). So, it's negligible.Therefore, the jump condition is:( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) = 1 )Which is what I had earlier. So, that part is correct.Therefore, the negative sign in ( A ) is correct, which leads to the Green's function for ( x < s ) being negative.But in the standard references, the Green's function for this problem is usually written with positive coefficients. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption of the form of the solution.Wait, another thought: perhaps the Green's function is defined such that ( G(x, s) ) is the response at ( x ) due to a unit impulse at ( s ). So, it's possible that the negative sign is correct depending on the orientation.Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the homogeneous solutions differently.Wait, let me think about the homogeneous solutions. The general solution is ( A sin(kx) + B cos(kx) ). But with the boundary conditions ( G(0, s) = 0 ) and ( G(1, s) = 0 ), we found that ( B = 0 ) for ( x < s ), and for ( x > s ), we had ( C sin(k) + D cos(k) = 0 ).But perhaps another approach is to consider the Green's function as a combination of two solutions: one that satisfies the left boundary condition and another that satisfies the right boundary condition.Wait, yes, that's another method. Let me try that.Let me denote ( y_1(x) ) as the solution satisfying ( y_1(0) = 0 ) and ( y_1(1) ) arbitrary, and ( y_2(x) ) as the solution satisfying ( y_2(1) = 0 ) and ( y_2(0) ) arbitrary.But actually, for the Green's function, we can construct it by considering two solutions: one that satisfies the left boundary condition and another that satisfies the right boundary condition.So, let me define:For ( x < s ), the solution is proportional to ( sin(kx) ), since ( G(0, s) = 0 ).For ( x > s ), the solution is proportional to ( sin(k(1 - x)) ), since ( G(1, s) = 0 ).Therefore, the Green's function can be written as:For ( x < s ):( G(x, s) = A sin(kx) )For ( x > s ):( G(x, s) = B sin(k(1 - x)) )Now, we need to determine ( A ) and ( B ) such that:1. ( G(x, s) ) is continuous at ( x = s ): ( A sin(ks) = B sin(k(1 - s)) )2. The jump condition in the derivative: ( G'_2(s, s) - G'_1(s, s) = 1 )Compute the derivatives:( G'_1(x, s) = A k cos(kx) )( G'_2(x, s) = -B k cos(k(1 - x)) )At ( x = s ):( G'_2(s, s) = -B k cos(k(1 - s)) )( G'_1(s, s) = A k cos(ks) )So, the jump condition:( -B k cos(k(1 - s)) - A k cos(ks) = 1 )From the continuity condition:( A sin(ks) = B sin(k(1 - s)) )So, ( B = A frac{ sin(ks) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )Substitute ( B ) into the jump condition:( -A frac{ sin(ks) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } k cos(k(1 - s)) - A k cos(ks) = 1 )Factor out ( -A k ):( -A k left( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + cos(ks) right ) = 1 )Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:( frac{ sin(ks) cos(k(1 - s)) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } + cos(ks) )Again, using the identity ( sin(A) cos(B) + cos(A) sin(B) = sin(A + B) ), but here we have:Let me denote ( A = ks ) and ( B = k(1 - s) ), then:( frac{ sin(A) cos(B) }{ sin(B) } + cos(A) = frac{ sin(A) cos(B) + cos(A) sin(B) }{ sin(B) } = frac{ sin(A + B) }{ sin(B) } )But ( A + B = ks + k(1 - s) = k ), so:( frac{ sin(k) }{ sin(B) } = frac{ sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses is ( frac{ sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } )So, substituting back:( -A k cdot frac{ sin(k) }{ sin(k(1 - s)) } = 1 )Solving for ( A ):( A = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } )Which is the same result as before. Therefore, the Green's function is:For ( x < s ):( G(x, s) = - frac{ sin(k(1 - s)) }{ k sin(k) } sin(kx) )For ( x > s ):( G(x, s) = frac{ sin(ks) }{ k sin(k) } sin(k(1 - x)) )So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the Green's function is correctly determined with the negative sign for ( x < s ).But in many references, the Green's function is written without the negative sign. So, perhaps I should consider whether the negative sign is correct.Wait, let me think about the physical interpretation. The Green's function represents the response at ( x ) due to a unit impulse at ( s ). If the impulse is at ( s ), the response to the left of ( s ) (i.e., ( x < s )) should be in the opposite direction compared to the response to the right of ( s ). Therefore, the negative sign makes sense because the displacement to the left of ( s ) would be opposite in phase to the displacement to the right of ( s ).Alternatively, perhaps the negative sign is due to the orientation of the derivative jump. Since the delta function is positive, the derivative jumps upwards, which would cause the Green's function to have a negative slope to the left and positive slope to the right, leading to a negative value to the left and positive to the right.Therefore, the negative sign is correct.So, putting it all together, the Green's function is:G(x, s) = begin{cases}- dfrac{sin(k(1 - s)) sin(kx)}{k sin(k)}, & 0 leq x < s, dfrac{sin(ks) sin(k(1 - x))}{k sin(k)}, & s < x leq 1.end{cases}Alternatively, this can be written using the minimum and maximum functions as:G(x, s) = frac{sin(k min(x, s)) sin(k(1 - max(x, s)))}{k sin(k)}But with the understanding that for ( x < s ), the expression includes a negative sign, which isn't captured by the min and max form unless we include an absolute value or adjust the signs accordingly.But in our case, the negative sign is inherent in the piecewise definition, so it's clearer to present it as two separate cases.Therefore, the final expression for the Green's function is as above."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = x^2 + 2ax + 2, where x in [-5, 5],  (1) Find the maximum and minimum values of the function when a = -1;  (2) Determine the range of the real number a such that y = f(x) is a monotonic function on the interval [-5, 5];  (3) Find the minimum value of the function f(x), denoted as g(a), and then find the maximum value of g(a).","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = x² + 2a x + 2, and I need to solve three parts. Let me take them one by one.**Part 1: Find the maximum and minimum values when a = -1.**Alright, so first, plug in a = -1 into the function. That gives f(x) = x² + 2*(-1)x + 2, which simplifies to f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Now, since this is a quadratic function, its graph is a parabola. The coefficient of x² is positive, so it opens upwards, meaning the vertex is the minimum point.To find the vertex, I can use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex: x = -b/(2a). Wait, in the standard quadratic form, it's ax² + bx + c, so here a is 1, b is -2. So x = -(-2)/(2*1) = 2/2 = 1. So the vertex is at x = 1.Now, let's find the value at x = 1: f(1) = 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the minimum value is 1.Since the parabola opens upwards, the maximum on the interval [-5,5] will be at one of the endpoints. So I need to evaluate f(-5) and f(5).Calculating f(-5): (-5)² - 2*(-5) + 2 = 25 + 10 + 2 = 37.Calculating f(5): 5² - 2*5 + 2 = 25 - 10 + 2 = 17.So the maximum value is 37 at x = -5, and the minimum is 1 at x = 1.Wait, but hold on, is x = 1 within the interval [-5,5]? Yes, it is. So that's correct.**Part 2: Determine the range of a such that f(x) is monotonic on [-5,5].**Monotonic means the function is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing on the interval. For a quadratic function, which is a parabola, it will be monotonic on an interval if the interval doesn't contain the vertex. So, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a). Wait, in our function, f(x) = x² + 2a x + 2, so the standard form is ax² + bx + c, which here is 1x² + (2a)x + 2. So the vertex is at x = - (2a)/(2*1) = -a.So the vertex is at x = -a. For the function to be monotonic on [-5,5], the vertex must lie outside the interval [-5,5]. That is, either -a ≤ -5 or -a ≥ 5.So solving for a:Case 1: -a ≤ -5 ⇒ a ≥ 5.Case 2: -a ≥ 5 ⇒ a ≤ -5.Therefore, the function is monotonic on [-5,5] if a ≤ -5 or a ≥ 5.Wait, let me verify. If a is between -5 and 5, the vertex x = -a would be between -5 and 5, meaning the function would have a minimum (since the parabola opens upwards) inside the interval, so it wouldn't be monotonic. So yes, outside that range, the function is monotonic.**Part 3: Find the minimum value of f(x), denoted as g(a), and then find the maximum value of g(a).**So, first, find the minimum value of f(x). Since it's a quadratic function opening upwards, the minimum occurs at the vertex. As before, the vertex is at x = -a. So plug x = -a into f(x):f(-a) = (-a)² + 2a*(-a) + 2 = a² - 2a² + 2 = -a² + 2.So g(a) = -a² + 2.Now, we need to find the maximum value of g(a). Since g(a) is a quadratic function in terms of a, opening downwards (because the coefficient of a² is negative), its maximum occurs at the vertex.The vertex of g(a) is at a = -b/(2c). Wait, g(a) = -a² + 2, so in standard form, it's -1*a² + 0*a + 2. So the vertex is at a = -0/(2*(-1)) = 0.So the maximum of g(a) is at a = 0, and g(0) = -0 + 2 = 2.Wait, but hold on. Is there any restriction on a? Because in part 2, we saw that for a between -5 and 5, the function f(x) isn't monotonic, but here, g(a) is defined for all real numbers a, right? Because the minimum exists regardless of a.But wait, no, actually, when a is such that the vertex x = -a is within the interval [-5,5], then the minimum is at x = -a, which is g(a) = -a² + 2. But if the vertex is outside the interval, then the minimum would be at one of the endpoints.Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because in part 3, the function f(x) is defined on [-5,5], so the minimum value of f(x) is either at the vertex if the vertex is inside [-5,5], or at one of the endpoints otherwise.So, to correctly find g(a), we have to consider two cases:Case 1: The vertex x = -a is inside [-5,5], i.e., -5 ≤ -a ≤ 5 ⇒ -5 ≤ -a ≤ 5 ⇒ -5 ≤ -a ⇒ a ≤ 5, and -a ≤ 5 ⇒ a ≥ -5. So when a ∈ [-5,5], the minimum is at x = -a, so g(a) = -a² + 2.Case 2: If a < -5, then the vertex is at x = -a > 5, so the function is decreasing on [-5,5], so the minimum is at x = 5.Similarly, if a > 5, the vertex is at x = -a < -5, so the function is increasing on [-5,5], so the minimum is at x = -5.So, let's compute g(a) in these cases.Case 1: a ∈ [-5,5], g(a) = -a² + 2.Case 2: a < -5, compute f(5) = 5² + 2a*5 + 2 = 25 + 10a + 2 = 27 + 10a.Case 3: a > 5, compute f(-5) = (-5)² + 2a*(-5) + 2 = 25 -10a + 2 = 27 -10a.So, g(a) is a piecewise function:g(a) = { 27 + 10a, if a < -5;         -a² + 2, if -5 ≤ a ≤ 5;         27 - 10a, if a > 5 }Now, to find the maximum value of g(a). Let's analyze each piece.First, for a < -5: g(a) = 27 + 10a. This is a linear function with slope 10, which is increasing. So as a increases towards -5, g(a) increases. The maximum in this region is at a = -5: g(-5) = 27 + 10*(-5) = 27 - 50 = -23.For a > 5: g(a) = 27 - 10a. This is a linear function with slope -10, decreasing. So as a increases, g(a) decreases. The maximum in this region is at a = 5: g(5) = 27 - 10*5 = 27 - 50 = -23.For -5 ≤ a ≤ 5: g(a) = -a² + 2. This is a downward opening parabola, so its maximum is at a = 0, which is g(0) = -0 + 2 = 2.Comparing the maximums from each region: the maximum in the middle region is 2, which is higher than the -23 in the other regions. So the overall maximum of g(a) is 2.So, to recap:g(a) is 27 + 10a when a < -5, which peaks at -23 when a approaches -5.g(a) is 27 - 10a when a > 5, which also peaks at -23 when a approaches 5.And in between, it's a downward parabola peaking at 2 when a = 0.Therefore, the maximum value of g(a) is 2.Wait, but let me double-check. When a is in [-5,5], g(a) = -a² + 2, which indeed has a maximum at a=0. So yes, 2 is the maximum.So, summarizing:1. When a = -1, the minimum is 1 and maximum is 37.2. The function is monotonic on [-5,5] when a ≤ -5 or a ≥ 5.3. The minimum value g(a) is a piecewise function, and its maximum is 2.**Final Answer**(1) The maximum value is boxed{37} and the minimum value is boxed{1}.(2) The range of a is boxed{(-infty, -5] cup [5, +infty)}.(3) The maximum value of g(a) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"A puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds.

So, substituting, the integral becomes:16 · ∫₀^{π/2} sin⁶(u) · cos²(u) · 2 du.Wait, because dx = 2 du, so the integral becomes 16 · 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin⁶(u) cos²(u) du, which is 32 ∫₀^{π/2} sin⁶(u) cos²(u) du.Okay, so now the problem reduces to computing 32 times the integral from 0 to π/2 of sin⁶(u) cos²(u) du. That seems more manageable.I recall that integrals of the form ∫ sinⁿ(u) cosᵐ(u) du can often be evaluated using beta functions or gamma functions, especially when the limits are from 0 to π/2. The formula I remember is:∫₀^{π/2} sinⁿ(u) cosᵐ(u) du = (1/2) B((n+1)/2, (m+1)/2),where B is the beta function, which relates to the gamma function via B(a, b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b). So, maybe I can use that here.In our case, n = 6 and m = 2. Plugging into the formula, we get:(1/2) B((6+1)/2, (2+1)/2) = (1/2) B(7/2, 3/2).Now, let's compute B(7/2, 3/2). Using the relation with gamma functions:B(7/2, 3/2) = Γ(7/2)Γ(3/2) / Γ(7/2 + 3/2) = Γ(7/2)Γ(3/2) / Γ(5).I know that Γ(n) = (n-1)! for positive integers, so Γ(5) = 4! = 24.Now, I need to compute Γ(7/2) and Γ(3/2). I remember that Γ(1/2) = √π, and Γ(3/2) = (1/2)Γ(1/2) = (1/2)√π. Similarly, Γ(5/2) = (3/2)Γ(3/2) = (3/2)(1/2)√π = (3/4)√π, and Γ(7/2) = (5/2)Γ(5/2) = (5/2)(3/4)√π = (15/8)√π.So, Γ(7/2) = (15/8)√π and Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π. Therefore, B(7/2, 3/2) = [(15/8)√π · (1/2)√π] / 24.Let me compute that step by step:First, multiply Γ(7/2) and Γ(3/2):(15/8)√π · (1/2)√π = (15/16) π.Then, divide by Γ(5) which is 24:(15/16) π / 24 = (15 π) / (16 · 24) = (15 π) / 384.Simplify 15/384: both divisible by 3, so 5/128. So, B(7/2, 3/2) = (5 π) / 128.Wait, let me check that again. 15 divided by 3 is 5, and 384 divided by 3 is 128. So yes, 15/384 simplifies to 5/128. So, B(7/2, 3/2) = (5 π)/128.But remember, the integral was (1/2) B(7/2, 3/2), so:∫₀^{π/2} sin⁶(u) cos²(u) du = (1/2) · (5 π)/128 = (5 π)/256.So, going back to our original expression, we had 32 times this integral:32 · (5 π)/256.Simplify 32/256: 32 divides into 256 eight times, so 32/256 = 1/8.Therefore, 32 · (5 π)/256 = (5 π)/8.So, the value of the integral is (5 π)/8.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Original integral: ∫₀^π 16 sin⁶(x/2) cos²(x/2) dx.2. Substituted u = x/2, so du = dx/2, dx = 2 du. Limits change from 0 to π/2.3. Integral becomes 16 * 2 ∫₀^{π/2} sin⁶(u) cos²(u) du = 32 ∫₀^{π/2} sin⁶(u) cos²(u) du.4. Used the beta function formula: ∫₀^{π/2} sinⁿ(u) cosᵐ(u) du = (1/2) B((n+1)/2, (m+1)/2).5. Plugged in n=6, m=2: (1/2) B(7/2, 3/2).6. Computed B(7/2, 3/2) = Γ(7/2)Γ(3/2)/Γ(5).7. Γ(7/2) = (15/8)√π, Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π, Γ(5)=24.8. So, B(7/2, 3/2) = [(15/8)√π · (1/2)√π] / 24 = (15/16 π) / 24 = (15 π)/384 = 5 π / 128.9. Then, the integral is (1/2) * (5 π)/128 = 5 π / 256.10. Multiply by 32: 32 * (5 π)/256 = (5 π)/8.Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 5π/8.Alternatively, I could have used the power-reduction formulas for sin⁶(u) and cos²(u). Let me try that approach to confirm.First, express sin⁶(u) as (sin²(u))³. We know that sin²(u) = (1 - cos(2u))/2. So, sin⁶(u) = [(1 - cos(2u))/2]^3.Similarly, cos²(u) = (1 + cos(2u))/2.So, sin⁶(u) cos²(u) = [(1 - cos(2u))/2]^3 · [(1 + cos(2u))/2].Let me expand this expression.First, let me compute [(1 - cos(2u))/2]^3:= (1 - 3 cos(2u) + 3 cos²(2u) - cos³(2u)) / 8.Then, multiply by [(1 + cos(2u))/2]:= [ (1 - 3 cos(2u) + 3 cos²(2u) - cos³(2u)) / 8 ] · [ (1 + cos(2u)) / 2 ]= [ (1 - 3 cos(2u) + 3 cos²(2u) - cos³(2u))(1 + cos(2u)) ] / 16.Now, let's multiply out the numerator:First, multiply 1 by each term in the second polynomial:1 * 1 = 11 * cos(2u) = cos(2u)Then, -3 cos(2u) * 1 = -3 cos(2u)-3 cos(2u) * cos(2u) = -3 cos²(2u)Then, 3 cos²(2u) * 1 = 3 cos²(2u)3 cos²(2u) * cos(2u) = 3 cos³(2u)Then, -cos³(2u) * 1 = -cos³(2u)-cos³(2u) * cos(2u) = -cos⁴(2u)So, combining all these terms:1 + cos(2u) - 3 cos(2u) - 3 cos²(2u) + 3 cos²(2u) + 3 cos³(2u) - cos³(2u) - cos⁴(2u).Now, let's combine like terms:1. Constant term: 12. cos(2u) terms: cos(2u) - 3 cos(2u) = -2 cos(2u)3. cos²(2u) terms: -3 cos²(2u) + 3 cos²(2u) = 04. cos³(2u) terms: 3 cos³(2u) - cos³(2u) = 2 cos³(2u)5. cos⁴(2u) term: -cos⁴(2u)So, the numerator simplifies to:1 - 2 cos(2u) + 2 cos³(2u) - cos⁴(2u).Therefore, sin⁶(u) cos²(u) = [1 - 2 cos(2u) + 2 cos³(2u) - cos⁴(2u)] / 16.So, the integral becomes:32 ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - 2 cos(2u) + 2 cos³(2u) - cos⁴(2u)] / 16 du.Simplify 32/16 = 2, so it's 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [1 - 2 cos(2u) + 2 cos³(2u) - cos⁴(2u)] du.Now, let's split the integral into four separate integrals:2 [ ∫₀^{π/2} 1 du - 2 ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2u) du + 2 ∫₀^{π/2} cos³(2u) du - ∫₀^{π/2} cos⁴(2u) du ].Let's compute each integral one by one.1. ∫₀^{π/2} 1 du = [u]₀^{π/2} = π/2 - 0 = π/2.2. ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2u) du. Let me make a substitution: let t = 2u, so dt = 2 du, du = dt/2. When u=0, t=0; when u=π/2, t=π.So, ∫₀^{π/2} cos(2u) du = ∫₀^{π} cos(t) · (dt/2) = (1/2) ∫₀^{π} cos(t) dt = (1/2)[sin(t)]₀^{π} = (1/2)(0 - 0) = 0.3. ∫₀^{π/2} cos³(2u) du. Hmm, integrating cos³(2u) can be done using substitution or reduction formulas. Let me use substitution.Let t = sin(2u), then dt = 2 cos(2u) du. Hmm, but we have cos³(2u) du, which is cos²(2u) · cos(2u) du. So, express cos²(2u) as 1 - sin²(2u) = 1 - t².So, ∫ cos³(2u) du = ∫ (1 - t²) · (dt/2). Because dt = 2 cos(2u) du, so cos(2u) du = dt/2.Thus, ∫ cos³(2u) du = (1/2) ∫ (1 - t²) dt = (1/2)(t - t³/3) + C.Now, substitute back t = sin(2u):= (1/2)(sin(2u) - sin³(2u)/3) + C.Now, evaluate from 0 to π/2:At u = π/2: sin(2*(π/2)) = sin(π) = 0, so the expression is (1/2)(0 - 0) = 0.At u = 0: sin(0) = 0, so the expression is also 0.Thus, ∫₀^{π/2} cos³(2u) du = 0 - 0 = 0.Wait, that seems odd. Let me check.Wait, when u goes from 0 to π/2, 2u goes from 0 to π. So, t = sin(2u) goes from 0 to 0, because sin(0) = 0 and sin(π) = 0. So, the integral from 0 to π/2 of cos³(2u) du is indeed 0.Hmm, interesting. So, the third integral is 0.4. ∫₀^{π/2} cos⁴(2u) du. This can be evaluated using power-reduction formulas.Recall that cos⁴(x) = (3 + 4 cos(2x) + cos(4x))/8. So, let's apply that.So, cos⁴(2u) = (3 + 4 cos(4u) + cos(8u))/8.Therefore, ∫ cos⁴(2u) du = ∫ (3 + 4 cos(4u) + cos(8u))/8 du = (3/8)u + (4/8)(sin(4u)/4) + (1/8)(sin(8u)/8) + C.Simplify:= (3/8)u + (1/8) sin(4u) + (1/64) sin(8u) + C.Now, evaluate from 0 to π/2:At u = π/2:= (3/8)(π/2) + (1/8) sin(4*(π/2)) + (1/64) sin(8*(π/2))= (3π/16) + (1/8) sin(2π) + (1/64) sin(4π)= (3π/16) + 0 + 0 = 3π/16.At u = 0:= (3/8)(0) + (1/8) sin(0) + (1/64) sin(0) = 0.So, ∫₀^{π/2} cos⁴(2u) du = 3π/16 - 0 = 3π/16.Putting it all together:2 [ (π/2) - 2*(0) + 2*(0) - (3π/16) ] = 2 [ π/2 - 3π/16 ].Compute π/2 - 3π/16:π/2 = 8π/16, so 8π/16 - 3π/16 = 5π/16.Multiply by 2: 2*(5π/16) = 5π/8.So, same result as before. Therefore, the integral is indeed 5π/8.I think that confirms it. So, the value of the original integral is 5π/8.**Final Answer**The value of the integral is boxed{dfrac{5pi}{8}}."},{"question":"Two individuals, person A and person B, agree to meet at a certain location within 10 days. They promise that whoever arrives first will wait for the other person for up to 3 days before leaving. If their arrival at the destination within the specified period is equally likely, what is the probability that they will meet?","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem where two people, A and B, agree to meet at a certain location within 10 days. They both promise that whoever arrives first will wait for the other person for up to 3 days before leaving. I need to find the probability that they will meet. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I think this is a problem about two people arriving at some location on different days, and we need to calculate the probability that their arrival times are within 3 days of each other. So, if person A arrives on day x, person B needs to arrive between day x-3 and day x+3 for them to meet. But since the total period is 10 days, I have to consider the boundaries as well.Let me visualize this. Maybe a coordinate system where one axis is person A's arrival day and the other is person B's arrival day. So, both axes go from 0 to 10 days. The total possible area where they can arrive is a square with sides of length 10, so the area is 100. The area where they meet would be the region where the difference between their arrival days is less than or equal to 3 days. So, I need to calculate that area and then divide it by the total area to get the probability.Wait, so the condition is |x - y| ≤ 3, where x is person A's arrival day and y is person B's arrival day. That makes sense. So, in the coordinate system, this would form a band around the diagonal of the square. The area outside this band would be two triangles where |x - y| > 3.Let me sketch this mentally. The square has corners at (0,0), (10,0), (10,10), and (0,10). The line x = y runs diagonally through the square. The region where |x - y| ≤ 3 is the area between the lines y = x + 3 and y = x - 3.So, the area where they meet is the area between these two lines. To find this area, I can subtract the areas of the two triangles where |x - y| > 3 from the total area.Each of these triangles is located in the top-left and bottom-right corners of the square. Each triangle has a base and a height. Since the lines y = x + 3 and y = x - 3 intersect the square at certain points, let me find those intersection points.For the line y = x + 3: when x = 0, y = 3; when y = 10, x = 7. So, this line goes from (0,3) to (7,10).Similarly, for the line y = x - 3: when x = 3, y = 0; when x = 10, y = 7. So, this line goes from (3,0) to (10,7).Therefore, the two triangles are:1. Top-left triangle: bounded by (0,3), (7,10), and (0,10).2. Bottom-right triangle: bounded by (3,0), (10,7), and (10,0).Each of these triangles has a base and a height of (10 - 3) = 7 days. Wait, no. Let me check. The base of the top-left triangle is from (0,3) to (7,10). Hmm, actually, the base is along the top edge from (0,10) to (7,10), which is 7 units long, and the height is from (7,10) down to (7,3), which is also 7 units. So, each triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs of length 7.Therefore, the area of each triangle is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*7*7 = 24.5.Since there are two such triangles, the total area where they do not meet is 24.5 * 2 = 49.Therefore, the area where they meet is the total area minus the area where they don't meet: 100 - 49 = 51.So, the probability that they meet is 51/100, which is 0.51 or 51%.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify if I considered all the cases correctly. Is there a possibility that the waiting period could extend beyond the 10-day window? For example, if person A arrives on day 9, they would wait until day 12, but since the meeting is only within 10 days, person B can't arrive after day 10. So, in this case, the waiting period is truncated at day 10.Similarly, if person A arrives on day 1, they would wait until day 4, but person B could arrive on day 0, but since arrival is within 10 days, day 0 isn't considered. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says \\"arrival at the destination within the specified period is equally likely.\\" So, I think arrival is uniformly distributed between day 0 and day 10, inclusive.Wait, hold on, actually, the problem says \\"within 10 days,\\" so does that mean arrival can be on any day from day 1 to day 10, or is it a continuous period? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify whether the arrival is on discrete days or a continuous time interval. Hmm, this is important because if it's discrete, the calculation would be different.But the problem says \\"arrival at the destination within the specified period is equally likely,\\" which sounds like a uniform distribution over the interval. So, I think it's a continuous problem, meaning arrival times are continuous between 0 and 10 days.Therefore, my initial approach with the coordinate system is correct because it models continuous arrival times.But just to be thorough, let me think about the discrete case as well, in case that's what the problem is expecting.If arrival is discrete, meaning each person can arrive on any day from 1 to 10, inclusive, with equal probability, then the total number of possible arrival combinations is 10*10 = 100.The number of favorable outcomes where |x - y| ≤ 3 would be the number of pairs (x,y) such that the difference is at most 3 days.To calculate this, for each day x that person A arrives, count the number of days y that person B can arrive such that |x - y| ≤ 3.For example:- If A arrives on day 1, B can arrive on days 1, 2, 3, 4 (since 1-3 is negative, so we take from day 1 to day 4). That's 4 days.- If A arrives on day 2, B can arrive on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That's 5 days.- Similarly, for days 3 to 8, B can arrive within 3 days before and after, so that's 7 days each.- For day 9, B can arrive on days 6,7,8,9,10. That's 5 days.- For day 10, B can arrive on days 7,8,9,10. That's 4 days.So, calculating the total number of favorable outcomes:Days 1 and 10: 4 each, so 4 + 4 = 8.Days 2 and 9: 5 each, so 5 + 5 = 10.Days 3 to 8: 7 each, there are 6 days, so 7*6 = 42.Total favorable outcomes: 8 + 10 + 42 = 60.Therefore, the probability is 60/100 = 0.6 or 60%.Wait, that's different from the continuous case where I got 51%. Hmm, so the answer depends on whether the arrival times are continuous or discrete.Looking back at the problem statement: \\"If their arrival at the destination within the specified period is equally likely...\\" The phrase \\"equally likely\\" is often used in discrete probability, but it can also be interpreted in continuous terms as a uniform distribution.But in the problem statement, it's not specified whether the arrival is on discrete days or a continuous interval. Hmm, tricky.Wait, the problem says \\"within 10 days,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean 10 days as a continuous period or 10 discrete days. But given that in the continuous case, the probability is 51%, and in the discrete case, it's 60%, which one is more likely?Wait, in probability problems, unless specified otherwise, if the time is involved, it's usually considered continuous. So, maybe the answer is 51%.But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the continuous case.In the continuous case, the area where |x - y| ≤ 3 is the area between the two lines y = x + 3 and y = x - 3 in the 10x10 square.The area outside this region is two triangles, each with base and height of (10 - 3) = 7. So, area of each triangle is (1/2)*7*7 = 24.5. So, total area outside is 49, so area inside is 100 - 49 = 51.Hence, probability is 51/100 = 0.51.But wait, in the discrete case, it's 60/100 = 0.6.So, which one is correct?Wait, the problem says \\"arrival at the destination within the specified period is equally likely.\\" So, if it's within 10 days, and arrival is equally likely, that can be interpreted as a uniform distribution over the interval [0,10], which is continuous.Therefore, I think the continuous case is the correct approach, giving a probability of 51%.But just to make sure, let me think about the problem again.If arrival is continuous, the probability density function is uniform over [0,10]. So, the joint distribution is uniform over the square [0,10]x[0,10]. The condition |x - y| ≤ 3 is a band around the diagonal.So, the area where they meet is 100 - 2*(1/2)*(10 - 3)^2 = 100 - 49 = 51.Therefore, probability is 51%.Alternatively, if arrival is discrete, the probability is 60%.But since the problem mentions \\"within 10 days\\" without specifying discrete days, I think it's safer to go with the continuous case.Wait, but another way to think about it is that the problem might be similar to the classic \\"meeting problem\\" where two people agree to meet within a certain time frame and wait for each other for a certain amount of time. In that classic problem, it's usually continuous, and the solution is similar to what I did with the area.So, yeah, I think 51% is the correct answer.But just to double-check, let me compute the area again.Total area is 10*10 = 100.The area where |x - y| > 3 is two triangles.Each triangle has legs of length 10 - 3 = 7.Area of one triangle is (1/2)*7*7 = 24.5.So, two triangles: 24.5*2 = 49.Thus, area where |x - y| ≤ 3 is 100 - 49 = 51.Therefore, probability is 51/100 = 0.51.Yes, that seems correct.So, I think the probability they meet is 51%.But just to make sure, let me think about it another way.Suppose person A arrives on day x, uniformly distributed between 0 and 10. Then, person B must arrive between x - 3 and x + 3. However, we have to consider the boundaries.So, the probability that B arrives within 3 days of A is:If x is between 0 and 3, then B must arrive between 0 and x + 3.If x is between 3 and 7, then B must arrive between x - 3 and x + 3.If x is between 7 and 10, then B must arrive between x - 3 and 10.So, integrating over x from 0 to 10, the probability density function for B is 1/10, so the probability is the integral from 0 to 10 of (length of interval where B can arrive) * (1/10) dx.So, let's compute this.First, for x from 0 to 3:The interval for B is from 0 to x + 3. So, the length is x + 3.For x from 3 to 7:The interval is from x - 3 to x + 3. Length is 6.For x from 7 to 10:The interval is from x - 3 to 10. Length is 10 - (x - 3) = 13 - x.So, the total probability is:Integral from 0 to 3 of (x + 3)*(1/10) dx +Integral from 3 to 7 of 6*(1/10) dx +Integral from 7 to 10 of (13 - x)*(1/10) dx.Let's compute each integral.First integral: 0 to 3, (x + 3)/10 dx.Integral of x is (1/2)x², integral of 3 is 3x.So, evaluated from 0 to 3:[(1/2)(3)^2 + 3*(3)] - [0 + 0] = (4.5 + 9) = 13.5Multiply by 1/10: 13.5/10 = 1.35Second integral: 3 to 7, 6/10 dx.That's (6/10)*(7 - 3) = (6/10)*4 = 24/10 = 2.4Third integral: 7 to 10, (13 - x)/10 dx.Integral of 13 is 13x, integral of x is (1/2)x².So, evaluated from 7 to 10:[13*10 - (1/2)(10)^2] - [13*7 - (1/2)(7)^2]Compute each part:At 10: 130 - 50 = 80At 7: 91 - 24.5 = 66.5So, difference: 80 - 66.5 = 13.5Multiply by 1/10: 13.5/10 = 1.35Now, sum all three parts:1.35 + 2.4 + 1.35 = 5.1So, the total probability is 5.1, which is 51%.Yes, that confirms it. So, the probability is 51%.Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The probability that they will meet is boxed{dfrac{51}{100}}."},{"question":"Given that A_{11}^{m}=11times10timesdotstimes6times5, find the value of m.","answer":"To determine the value of ( m ) in the permutation ( A_{11}^{m} = 11 times 10 times dots times 6 times 5 ), I start by recalling the formula for permutations, which is ( A_{n}^{m} = n times (n-1) times dots times (n - m + 1) ).Given that ( A_{11}^{m} = 11 times 10 times dots times 6 times 5 ), I observe that the sequence starts at 11 and ends at 5.

Knowing that each bus can accommodate up to 32 people at most, how many buses were there initially? And how many passengers were there?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about some travelers taking buses. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says: A group of travelers is taking a bus, with the requirement that the number of passengers on each bus is equal. Initially, each bus carried 22 people, leaving 1 person unable to board. If one bus leaves empty, then all the passengers can be evenly distributed among the remaining buses. Each bus can accommodate up to 32 people at most. We need to find how many buses were there initially and how many passengers there were.Hmm, okay. Let me try to translate this into equations. Let me denote the number of buses initially as ( b ) and the number of passengers as ( p ).So, initially, each bus carried 22 people, leaving 1 person unable to board. That means that the total number of passengers is 22 times the number of buses plus 1. So, mathematically, that would be:( p = 22b + 1 ).Got that down. Now, the second part says if one bus leaves empty, then all the passengers can be evenly distributed among the remaining buses. So, if one bus leaves, the number of buses becomes ( b - 1 ). And the passengers can be evenly distributed among these ( b - 1 ) buses. So, the number of passengers per bus in this case would be ( frac{p}{b - 1} ), and this has to be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a person on a bus.Also, each bus can accommodate up to 32 people. So, the number of passengers per bus after one bus leaves must be less than or equal to 32. So, ( frac{p}{b - 1} leq 32 ).Alright, so let me summarize the equations and inequalities:1. ( p = 22b + 1 )2. ( frac{p}{b - 1} ) is an integer.3. ( frac{p}{b - 1} leq 32 )So, substituting equation 1 into equation 2, we get:( frac{22b + 1}{b - 1} ) is an integer.And also:( frac{22b + 1}{b - 1} leq 32 )So, let me work on the first equation: ( frac{22b + 1}{b - 1} ) must be an integer.Let me try to simplify this expression. Let me perform the division:Divide 22b + 1 by b - 1.Using polynomial division or perhaps by rewriting the numerator.Let me write 22b + 1 as 22(b - 1) + something.So, 22(b - 1) = 22b - 22. Then, the numerator is 22b + 1, so subtracting 22b - 22 from 22b + 1 gives 23.So, 22b + 1 = 22(b - 1) + 23.Therefore, ( frac{22b + 1}{b - 1} = 22 + frac{23}{b - 1} ).So, this fraction is equal to 22 plus 23 divided by (b - 1). For this to be an integer, ( frac{23}{b - 1} ) must be an integer. So, ( b - 1 ) must be a divisor of 23.23 is a prime number, so its divisors are 1 and 23.Therefore, ( b - 1 = 1 ) or ( b - 1 = 23 ).So, solving for b:Case 1: ( b - 1 = 1 ) => ( b = 2 )Case 2: ( b - 1 = 23 ) => ( b = 24 )So, possible values for b are 2 or 24.Now, let's check each case.First, Case 1: b = 2.Then, p = 22*2 + 1 = 45.Now, if one bus leaves empty, the number of buses becomes 1. So, passengers per bus would be 45 / 1 = 45. But each bus can only accommodate up to 32 people. So, 45 > 32, which violates the condition. Therefore, b = 2 is not a valid solution.Case 2: b = 24.Then, p = 22*24 + 1 = 528 + 1 = 529.If one bus leaves empty, the number of buses becomes 23. So, passengers per bus would be 529 / 23.Let me compute that: 23*23 is 529, right? Because 20*23=460, and 3*23=69, so 460+69=529. So, 529 / 23 = 23.So, each bus would carry 23 passengers, which is within the limit of 32. So, this works.Therefore, the initial number of buses was 24, and the number of passengers was 529.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.First, p = 22b + 1. For b=24, p=22*24=528 +1=529. Correct.Then, if one bus leaves, buses left =23. 529 divided by 23 is indeed 23. So, each bus carries 23 passengers, which is less than 32. So, that's fine.And for b=2, p=45. If one bus leaves, only one bus remains, which would carry 45 passengers, exceeding the 32 limit. So, that's invalid.Therefore, only b=24 and p=529 is the solution.Wait, but just to make sure, are there any other divisors of 23? Since 23 is prime, only 1 and 23. So, no other possibilities for b-1. So, only two cases, and only one is valid.Hence, the answer is 24 buses and 529 passengers.**Final Answer**The number of buses initially was boxed{24} and the number of passengers was boxed{529}."},{"question":"A bullet with a mass of m=10 g, flying horizontally with a speed of v_{1}=500 m/s, passes through a massive board and exits with a speed of v_{2}=200 m/s. Find the amount of work done on the bullet by the resistive force of the board.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a bullet passing through a board. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The bullet has a mass of 10 grams, which is pretty light. It's moving horizontally at a speed of 500 meters per second. Then it goes through a massive board and exits with a speed of 200 meters per second. I need to find the amount of work done on the bullet by the resistive force of the board.Hmm, work done... I remember that work is related to force and distance, but in this case, I don't know the distance the bullet travels through the board. Wait, maybe I can use another approach. I think work done is also related to the change in kinetic energy. Yeah, that sounds familiar. The work-energy principle states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.So, if I can find the initial kinetic energy and the final kinetic energy of the bullet, then the difference between them should give me the work done by the resistive force. Let me write that down.The formula for kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², right? So, the initial kinetic energy (KE₁) is (1/2) * m * v₁², and the final kinetic energy (KE₂) is (1/2) * m * v₂². The work done (W) by the resistive force should be KE₁ - KE₂ because the bullet is losing energy as it passes through the board.But wait, the bullet is losing kinetic energy, so the work done by the resistive force should be negative, right? Because the force is opposing the motion of the bullet. So, the work done by the resistive force is equal to the negative of the change in kinetic energy.Let me make sure I have the signs right. If the bullet is slowing down, the resistive force is doing negative work on it. So, W = KE₂ - KE₁, but since KE₂ is less than KE₁, this would be negative. Alternatively, I can think of it as the work done by the resistive force equals the change in kinetic energy, which is KE₂ - KE₁. Since KE₂ is less, the work is negative. But the question is asking for the amount of work done, so maybe they just want the magnitude?Wait, the problem says \\"the amount of work done on the bullet by the resistive force.\\" So, in physics, work done by a force is the force times the displacement in the direction of the force. Since the resistive force is opposite to the bullet's motion, the work done is negative. But sometimes, people refer to the magnitude when they say \\"amount.\\" Hmm, I need to clarify that.But let me proceed step by step. First, convert the mass from grams to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms. So, 10 grams is 0.01 kilograms.Mass (m) = 0.01 kgInitial velocity (v₁) = 500 m/sFinal velocity (v₂) = 200 m/sCalculate initial kinetic energy:KE₁ = (1/2) * m * v₁² = 0.5 * 0.01 kg * (500 m/s)²Let me compute that. 500 squared is 250,000. So,KE₁ = 0.5 * 0.01 * 250,000 = 0.005 * 250,000 = 1250 JoulesWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. 0.5 * 0.01 is 0.005. 0.005 * 250,000 is indeed 1250 J. Okay, that's correct.Now, the final kinetic energy:KE₂ = (1/2) * m * v₂² = 0.5 * 0.01 kg * (200 m/s)²200 squared is 40,000. So,KE₂ = 0.5 * 0.01 * 40,000 = 0.005 * 40,000 = 200 JoulesSo, the change in kinetic energy is KE₂ - KE₁ = 200 J - 1250 J = -1050 JTherefore, the work done by the resistive force is -1050 J. But the question is asking for the amount of work done. So, if they just want the magnitude, it's 1050 J. But in physics, work done by a force is negative if it's opposing the motion. So, I think the answer should be -1050 J. But let me see if the question specifies direction or just the amount.Looking back at the problem: \\"Find the amount of work done on the bullet by the resistive force of the board.\\" The word \\"amount\\" might imply the magnitude, but in physics terminology, work done by a force is a scalar quantity, but it can be positive or negative depending on the direction of the force relative to displacement.Wait, actually, in this case, the bullet is moving through the board, so the resistive force is opposite to the displacement of the bullet. Therefore, the work done by the resistive force is negative. So, the amount of work done is -1050 J. But sometimes, people refer to the \\"amount\\" as the absolute value. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.But let me think again. The work done on the bullet by the resistive force. The bullet is losing kinetic energy, so the work done on it is negative. Alternatively, if we consider the work done by the resistive force, it's negative because it's opposite to the displacement. So, I think the answer is -1050 J. But perhaps the problem expects the magnitude, so 1050 J.Wait, let me check the formula again. Work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy. So, W = ΔKE = KE₂ - KE₁ = 200 - 1250 = -1050 J. So, that's the work done on the bullet by the resistive force. So, it's negative. So, the amount is -1050 J. But sometimes, people say \\"amount\\" meaning the magnitude, so 1050 J.But in physics, it's standard to include the sign. So, I think the answer is -1050 J. But let me see if the problem specifies whether it wants the magnitude or the actual work done. The problem says, \\"the amount of work done on the bullet by the resistive force of the board.\\" So, \\"amount\\" might mean the magnitude, but in physics, work is a scalar with a sign. So, I think it's safer to put -1050 J.But wait, let me think again. If the bullet is moving through the board, the resistive force is acting opposite to the direction of motion, so the work done by the resistive force is negative. So, the bullet loses kinetic energy, which is equal to the work done by the resistive force. So, the work done is negative.Alternatively, sometimes people consider the work done against the resistive force as positive, but in this case, the work done by the resistive force is negative.Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of energy transfer. The bullet is doing work against the resistive force, so the work done by the bullet is positive, but the work done on the bullet by the resistive force is negative.But the question is specifically asking for the work done on the bullet by the resistive force. So, that would be negative.But let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Mass is 0.01 kg, initial velocity 500 m/s, final velocity 200 m/s.KE₁ = 0.5 * 0.01 * (500)^2 = 0.005 * 250,000 = 1250 JKE₂ = 0.5 * 0.01 * (200)^2 = 0.005 * 40,000 = 200 JΔKE = 200 - 1250 = -1050 JSo, that's correct. So, the work done by the resistive force is -1050 J.But let me think about units. The mass is in kg, velocity in m/s, so the kinetic energy is in Joules, which is correct.Alternatively, sometimes people use grams for mass in such problems, but since we converted it to kg, it's fine.Wait, another thought: Is the board massive, meaning its mass is so large that its recoil is negligible? So, the board doesn't move, so all the work done is on the bullet. So, the work done by the resistive force is just the change in kinetic energy of the bullet.Yes, that makes sense. So, the work done by the resistive force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the bullet, which is -1050 J.But again, the problem says \\"the amount of work done.\\" So, if they want the magnitude, it's 1050 J. But in physics, it's standard to include the sign. So, I think the answer is -1050 J.But let me see if I can find any similar problems or examples. In most cases, when asked for work done by a resistive force, it's negative because it's opposite to the displacement. So, I think it's safe to say the answer is -1050 J.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. If I consider the work done by the resistive force, it's equal to the force times the distance, but I don't know the distance. However, I can relate it to the change in kinetic energy.So, W = F * d * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between force and displacement. Since the force is opposite, theta is 180 degrees, so cos(theta) is -1. Therefore, W = -F * d.But without knowing F or d, I can't compute it directly. So, the only way is through the work-energy principle, which gives me W = ΔKE = -1050 J.Therefore, I think the answer is -1050 J.But wait, let me check the calculation again. 500 squared is 250,000, times 0.005 is 1250. 200 squared is 40,000, times 0.005 is 200. 200 - 1250 is -1050. Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, if I think about it in terms of energy loss, the bullet loses 1050 J of kinetic energy, which is equal to the work done by the resistive force. So, the work done is -1050 J.But if the question is asking for the amount, which is a scalar quantity, maybe they just want 1050 J. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.Wait, let me check the wording again: \\"Find the amount of work done on the bullet by the resistive force of the board.\\" The word \\"amount\\" might imply the magnitude, but in physics, work is a scalar with a sign. So, I think the answer is -1050 J.But to be thorough, let me consider both possibilities. If they want the magnitude, it's 1050 J. If they want the actual work done, it's -1050 J.But in the context of physics problems, when they ask for work done by a force, they usually expect the sign. So, I think it's -1050 J.But let me think about another perspective. If I consider the work done by the resistive force as the force times the distance, and since the force is opposite to the displacement, the work is negative. So, yes, -1050 J.Alternatively, if I think about the work done on the bullet, it's negative because the force is opposite to the displacement. So, the bullet is being decelerated, so the work done on it is negative.Therefore, I think the answer is -1050 J.But just to make sure, let me think about the formula again. Work done W = ΔKE = KE_final - KE_initial = 200 - 1250 = -1050 J.Yes, that's correct.So, I think I've thought it through thoroughly. The work done by the resistive force on the bullet is -1050 Joules."},{"question":"Find the smallest positive real number ( r ) with the following property: For every choice of 2023 unit vectors ( mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2, ldots, mathbf{v}_{2023} in mathbb{R}^2 ), a point ( mathbf{p} ) can be found in the plane such that for each subset ( S ) of ({1, 2, ldots, 2023}), the sum[ sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i ]lies inside the disc (left{ mathbf{x} in mathbb{R}^2 : | mathbf{x} - mathbf{p} | leq r right}).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive real number ( r ) with a certain property related to unit vectors in the plane. Let me try to parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.We have 2023 unit vectors ( mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2, ldots, mathbf{v}_{2023} ) in ( mathbb{R}^2 ). For every possible choice of these vectors, there should exist a point ( mathbf{p} ) in the plane such that for every subset ( S ) of ( {1, 2, ldots, 2023} ), the sum ( sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i ) lies inside the disc centered at ( mathbf{p} ) with radius ( r ). Our goal is to find the smallest such ( r ).Hmm, so essentially, no matter how we choose these 2023 unit vectors, we can always find a point ( mathbf{p} ) such that all possible subset sums are within a distance ( r ) from ( mathbf{p} ). And we need the smallest ( r ) for which this is true.Let me think about what this means. The subset sums can range from the empty set (which is the zero vector) to the sum of all vectors. But since each vector is a unit vector, the maximum possible length of any subset sum is 2023, but that's only if all vectors are pointing in the same direction. However, depending on the directions of the vectors, the subset sums can vary a lot.But the key here is that for any configuration of these vectors, there exists a point ( mathbf{p} ) such that all subset sums are within ( r ) of ( mathbf{p} ). So, ( mathbf{p} ) is like a center that all subset sums are close to, regardless of how the vectors are arranged.This seems related to some kind of centering or balancing of the vectors. Maybe something like the centroid or the average of all possible subset sums? But I'm not sure.Wait, actually, the problem is about covering all subset sums with a single disc of radius ( r ). So, the disc needs to be large enough to contain all possible subset sums, regardless of how the vectors are arranged. But since the vectors can be arranged in any way, we need to find the minimal ( r ) such that this covering is always possible.Perhaps it's related to the concept of the diameter of the set of all subset sums. The diameter would be the maximum distance between any two subset sums. Then, the minimal ( r ) would be half of that diameter, because the disc can be centered at the midpoint between the two farthest subset sums.But let me think more carefully. If we can find a point ( mathbf{p} ) such that all subset sums are within ( r ) of ( mathbf{p} ), then the maximum distance from ( mathbf{p} ) to any subset sum is ( r ). So, the minimal ( r ) is the minimal possible maximum distance from any point ( mathbf{p} ) to all subset sums.In other words, ( r ) is the minimal value such that the covering radius of the set of subset sums is at most ( r ). The covering radius is the smallest radius such that a ball of that radius centered at ( mathbf{p} ) covers the entire set.But how do we compute this? It might be related to some geometric property of the set of subset sums.Wait, another approach: perhaps using linear algebra or vector balancing. Since all the vectors are in ( mathbb{R}^2 ), maybe we can use some kind of geometric argument.Alternatively, maybe we can think about the problem probabilistically. If we consider all subset sums, each vector is either included or not, so it's like a random walk in the plane where each step is a unit vector in some direction. The subset sum is the endpoint of this walk.But in our case, we don't have randomness; we need to cover all possible walks, regardless of the direction of each step. So, the worst-case scenario.Wait, but the problem says \\"for every choice of 2023 unit vectors\\", so we need a radius ( r ) that works no matter how the vectors are arranged. So, we need to consider the maximum possible spread of subset sums over all possible configurations of vectors.But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to think about specific configurations of vectors that would maximize the spread of subset sums, and then find the minimal ( r ) that can cover that spread.Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the concept of the diameter of the set of subset sums. If I can find the maximum possible diameter over all configurations, then ( r ) would be half of that.But what is the maximum possible diameter? The diameter is the maximum distance between any two subset sums.So, for a given set of vectors, the diameter is the maximum over all pairs ( S, T ) of ( | sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i - sum_{i in T} mathbf{v}_i | ). Which simplifies to ( | sum_{i in S setminus T} mathbf{v}_i - sum_{i in T setminus S} mathbf{v}_i | ).So, the diameter is the maximum over all possible symmetric differences of subsets ( S ) and ( T ) of the norm of the difference of their sums.But this seems complicated. Maybe instead of considering all pairs, we can think about the maximum possible difference between two subset sums.Wait, another idea: the set of subset sums is a subset of ( mathbb{R}^2 ). The minimal enclosing disc of this set must have a radius ( r ). We need to find the maximum possible minimal enclosing disc radius over all configurations of vectors, and then take the minimal ( r ) that works for all configurations.But how do we compute this? Maybe it's related to the maximum possible distance between two subset sums, as I thought earlier.Wait, perhaps the maximum possible distance between two subset sums is 2023, if all vectors are aligned in the same direction, so that the full sum is 2023, and the empty sum is 0. Then, the distance between them is 2023. But in that case, the minimal enclosing disc would have radius 2023/2, centered at 2023/2.But in that case, the radius is 1011.5, which is 2023/2. But is this the maximum possible diameter? Or can we have a larger diameter?Wait, actually, if all vectors are pointing in the same direction, the subset sums can range from 0 to 2023, so the diameter is 2023, and the minimal enclosing disc has radius 2023/2. But if the vectors are arranged differently, maybe the diameter is smaller?Wait, no, if the vectors are arranged in different directions, the subset sums can interfere destructively, so the maximum distance between two subset sums might actually be larger? Hmm, not necessarily.Wait, actually, if the vectors are arranged in opposite directions, then the subset sums can cancel each other out. For example, if half the vectors are pointing in one direction and half in the opposite, then the maximum subset sum could be up to 1011.5 in one direction, and similarly in the other direction, so the diameter would be 2023 again.Wait, but if you have vectors in different directions, the maximum distance between two subset sums might actually be larger because you can have more spread out points.Wait, no, actually, if the vectors are in different directions, the subset sums can be in different directions as well, but the maximum distance between any two subset sums would still be bounded by the sum of all vectors in some direction.Wait, perhaps the maximum possible diameter is 2023, which occurs when all vectors are aligned, but if the vectors are arranged in different directions, the diameter might be smaller? Or is it possible for the diameter to be larger?Wait, actually, no. Because the maximum distance between two subset sums would be the maximum over all possible pairs of subset sums. If the vectors are arranged in different directions, the maximum distance could be larger because you can have subset sums going off in different directions, but the maximum distance between any two points would still be bounded by the sum of all vectors in some direction.Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Suppose we have two vectors pointing in opposite directions, each of length 1. Then, the subset sums can be -2, 0, or +2. So, the diameter is 4, which is larger than the number of vectors, which is 2. So, in this case, the diameter is 4, which is 2 times 2.Wait, so in this case, the diameter is actually larger than the number of vectors. So, perhaps if we have vectors arranged in opposite directions, the diameter can be as large as 2 times the number of vectors? But in our case, the number of vectors is 2023, so the diameter could be up to 4046? That seems too large.But wait, in the case of two vectors, the diameter is 4, which is 2 times 2. So, in the case of n vectors, if they are arranged in opposite directions, the diameter is 2n. So, for 2023 vectors, the diameter would be 4046, which would make the minimal enclosing disc have radius 2023.But that can't be, because if all vectors are arranged in opposite directions, you can have subset sums ranging from -2023 to +2023, but in reality, each vector is a unit vector, so the maximum subset sum in any direction is 2023, but if they are arranged in opposite directions, the maximum distance between two subset sums would be 2023 - (-2023) = 4046? Wait, no, that's the total span, but the diameter is the maximum distance between any two points, which would be 4046 in this case.But that seems too large because if all vectors are in opposite directions, then the subset sums can only be in a line, so the diameter is 4046, but the minimal enclosing disc would have radius 2023, centered at the origin.Wait, but in that case, the origin is the midpoint between -2023 and +2023, so the radius would be 2023. But if all vectors are aligned in the same direction, the subset sums go from 0 to 2023, so the minimal enclosing disc would have radius 2023/2, centered at 2023/2.Wait, so depending on the arrangement of vectors, the minimal enclosing disc can have different radii. So, in the case where all vectors are aligned, the radius is 2023/2, but in the case where vectors are arranged in opposite directions, the radius is 2023.But the problem says \\"for every choice of 2023 unit vectors\\", so we need a radius ( r ) that works for any configuration. So, in the worst case, when the vectors are arranged in opposite directions, the minimal enclosing disc has radius 2023. But that seems too large because 2023 is the number of vectors, and each is a unit vector.Wait, but if all vectors are arranged in opposite directions, say half pointing in one direction and half in the opposite, but 2023 is odd, so it's 1011 in one direction and 1012 in the other. Then, the maximum subset sum in the positive direction would be 1012, and the maximum in the negative direction would be -1011. So, the diameter would be 1012 - (-1011) = 2023, so the minimal enclosing disc would have radius 2023/2, centered at (1012 - 1011)/2 = 0.5.Wait, that's interesting. So, in this case, the diameter is 2023, so the radius is 2023/2. But in the case where all vectors are aligned in the same direction, the subset sums go from 0 to 2023, so the diameter is 2023, and the minimal enclosing disc has radius 2023/2, centered at 2023/2.Wait, so in both cases, the minimal enclosing disc has radius 2023/2. Is that always the case?Wait, let me test with a smaller number of vectors. Suppose we have 3 vectors. If all are aligned, the subset sums go from 0 to 3, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius 1.5, centered at 1.5. If two are in one direction and one in the opposite, then the subset sums can be -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. So, the diameter is 4, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius 2, centered at 1.5.Wait, so in this case, the radius is larger when the vectors are arranged in opposite directions. So, for 3 vectors, the minimal enclosing disc radius is 2, which is larger than 1.5.Similarly, for 2 vectors, if they are in opposite directions, the subset sums are -2, 0, +2, so the diameter is 4, radius 2, centered at 0.But if they are aligned, the subset sums are 0, 1, 2, so the diameter is 2, radius 1, centered at 1.So, in this case, the radius is larger when the vectors are arranged in opposite directions.Therefore, for n vectors, the minimal enclosing disc radius is maximized when the vectors are arranged in opposite directions, giving a radius of n/2.Wait, but in the case of 3 vectors, we saw that the radius was 2, which is 3/1.5, but 3/2 is 1.5, but we had radius 2. Hmm, maybe my initial thought isn't correct.Wait, let's think again. For n vectors, if half are in one direction and half in the opposite, the maximum subset sum in one direction is roughly n/2, and in the opposite direction, it's roughly -n/2. So, the diameter is n, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius n/2.But in the case of 3 vectors, if two are in one direction and one in the opposite, the maximum subset sum in the positive direction is 2, and in the negative direction is -1. So, the diameter is 3, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius 1.5, centered at 0.5.Wait, so in that case, the radius is 1.5, which is 3/2. So, for n vectors, if arranged in opposite directions, the minimal enclosing disc has radius n/2.But in the case of 2 vectors, if arranged in opposite directions, the subset sums are -2, 0, +2, so the diameter is 4, so the radius is 2, which is 2/1. So, that doesn't fit the n/2 pattern.Wait, maybe the radius is n/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when n is even? Wait, no, for n=2, the radius is 2, which is n, not n/2.Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.Wait, let's think about the maximum possible distance between two subset sums. For n vectors, the maximum possible distance is n, because if all vectors are aligned, the subset sums go from 0 to n, so the distance is n. If arranged in opposite directions, the subset sums can go from -k to +m, where k + m = n, so the distance is k + m = n. So, in either case, the maximum distance is n.Therefore, the diameter is n, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius n/2.Wait, but in the case of n=2, if arranged in opposite directions, the subset sums are -2, 0, +2, so the diameter is 4, but n=2, so n/2=1, but the radius is 2. So, that contradicts.Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.Wait, for n=2 vectors, each of length 1, if they are arranged in opposite directions, say one at +1 and one at -1 on the real line. Then, the subset sums are:- Empty set: 0- First vector: +1- Second vector: -1- Both vectors: 0So, the subset sums are -1, 0, +1. So, the diameter is 2, from -1 to +1, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius 1, centered at 0.Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, in that case, the radius is 1, which is n/2.Wait, so maybe for n vectors, regardless of their arrangement, the minimal enclosing disc has radius at most n/2.But in the case where all vectors are aligned, the subset sums go from 0 to n, so the diameter is n, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius n/2, centered at n/2.In the case where vectors are arranged in opposite directions, the subset sums range from -k to +m, where k + m = n, so the diameter is k + m = n, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius n/2, centered at (m - k)/2.Wait, so regardless of the arrangement, the diameter is n, so the minimal enclosing disc has radius n/2.But in the case of n=2, if arranged in opposite directions, the subset sums are -1, 0, +1, so the diameter is 2, radius 1, which is n/2.Similarly, for n=3, if arranged in opposite directions, say two in one direction and one in the opposite, the subset sums can be -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. Wait, no, let's compute:Wait, if we have two vectors at +1 and one at -1.Subset sums:- Empty set: 0- First vector: +1- Second vector: +1- Third vector: -1- First and second: +2- First and third: 0- Second and third: 0- All three: +1So, the subset sums are -1, 0, +1, +2. So, the diameter is 3 (from -1 to +2), so the minimal enclosing disc has radius 1.5, centered at 0.5.Which is n/2 = 1.5.So, yes, in this case, the radius is n/2.Wait, so perhaps, regardless of the arrangement of the vectors, the minimal enclosing disc has radius at most n/2, and this is tight because when all vectors are aligned, the radius is exactly n/2.Therefore, for our problem, with n=2023, the minimal enclosing disc radius is 2023/2.But wait, in the problem statement, it says \\"for every choice of 2023 unit vectors\\", so regardless of how the vectors are arranged, we can find a point p such that all subset sums lie within a disc of radius r centered at p. So, the minimal such r is 2023/2.But wait, in the case where vectors are arranged in opposite directions, we saw that the minimal enclosing disc has radius n/2. So, in that case, it's the same as when all vectors are aligned.Therefore, the minimal r is 2023/2.But wait, let me think again. In the case where all vectors are aligned, the subset sums are all along a line from 0 to 2023. So, the minimal enclosing disc is centered at 2023/2 with radius 2023/2. Similarly, if the vectors are arranged in opposite directions, the subset sums can be spread out from -k to +m, but the minimal enclosing disc is still centered somewhere in the middle with radius 2023/2.Therefore, regardless of the arrangement, the minimal enclosing disc has radius 2023/2.But wait, is this always the case? Let me think of another configuration.Suppose the vectors are arranged in such a way that they form a regular polygon. For example, if we have vectors pointing in all different directions, equally spaced around the circle. Then, the subset sums would be spread out in all directions, but the maximum distance from the origin would be 2023, but the minimal enclosing disc would still have radius 2023/2, centered at the origin.Wait, but if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, how can a disc of radius 2023/2 cover all of them? Because if all vectors are aligned, the subset sums are along a line, but if they are spread out, the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane.Wait, no, the minimal enclosing disc must cover all subset sums, regardless of their positions. So, if the vectors are arranged in such a way that the subset sums can be anywhere, the disc must be large enough to cover the entire convex hull of the subset sums.But in the case where vectors are arranged in all directions, the subset sums can be anywhere within a circle of radius 2023. So, the minimal enclosing disc would have radius 2023, centered at the origin.Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.Wait, let me clarify. If all vectors are arranged in all directions, then the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, but actually, no. Each subset sum is a vector sum of some subset of the given vectors. So, if the vectors are arranged in all directions, the subset sums can be anywhere within the Minkowski sum of the vectors, which is a convex set.But the Minkowski sum of unit vectors in all directions would be a convex set, but the subset sums would be within a circle of radius 2023. So, the minimal enclosing disc would have radius 2023, centered at the origin.Wait, but that can't be, because if all vectors are arranged in all directions, the subset sums can be anywhere within a circle of radius 2023, so the minimal enclosing disc must have radius 2023.But earlier, when vectors are aligned, the minimal enclosing disc has radius 2023/2. So, which one is it?Wait, perhaps I'm confusing two different concepts. When the vectors are aligned, the subset sums lie on a line, so the minimal enclosing disc can be smaller, but when the vectors are spread out, the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, so the minimal enclosing disc must be larger.But the problem says \\"for every choice of 2023 unit vectors\\", so we need a radius r that works for any configuration. So, in the worst case, when the vectors are arranged such that the subset sums can be anywhere in a circle of radius 2023, the minimal enclosing disc must have radius 2023.But that can't be, because if all vectors are arranged in all directions, the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, but actually, each subset sum is a vector sum of some subset, so the maximum norm is 2023, but the minimal enclosing disc can be centered at the origin with radius 2023.Wait, but if we can choose the center p, maybe we can center it somewhere else to reduce the radius.Wait, for example, if all subset sums are symmetric around the origin, then the minimal enclosing disc can be centered at the origin with radius 2023. But if the subset sums are not symmetric, maybe we can shift the center to reduce the radius.Wait, but in the case where all vectors are aligned, the subset sums are on a line from 0 to 2023, so the minimal enclosing disc is centered at 2023/2 with radius 2023/2. If we center it at the origin, the radius would have to be 2023, which is worse.Similarly, if the vectors are arranged in opposite directions, the subset sums can be from -k to +m, so the minimal enclosing disc is centered at (m - k)/2 with radius (m + k)/2 = 2023/2.Wait, so in that case, the radius is 2023/2.But if the vectors are arranged in all directions, the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, but if we center the disc at the origin, the radius would have to be 2023. But maybe we can choose a different center to reduce the radius.Wait, but if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, how can we choose a center such that all subset sums are within a smaller radius?Wait, actually, no. If the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, then regardless of where you center the disc, you can't have a radius smaller than the maximum distance from that center to any subset sum.But if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, then the minimal enclosing disc must have an infinite radius, which is not the case.Wait, no, because each subset sum is a finite vector. Wait, actually, each subset sum is a vector in ( mathbb{R}^2 ), but the set of all subset sums is a bounded set because each vector is a unit vector, so the maximum norm of any subset sum is 2023.Therefore, the set of subset sums is contained within a disc of radius 2023 centered at the origin. But perhaps we can find a smaller disc by shifting the center.Wait, but if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, how can shifting the center help? For example, if the subset sums are spread out in all directions, the minimal enclosing disc must cover all of them, so the radius would be at least the maximum distance from the center to any subset sum.But if we can choose the center, maybe we can minimize the maximum distance.Wait, this is similar to the problem of finding the smallest enclosing circle of a set of points, where the center can be chosen anywhere. The minimal enclosing circle is the smallest circle that contains all the points.In our case, the points are the subset sums, which are a set of points in the plane. The minimal enclosing circle for this set would have a radius that depends on the configuration of the subset sums.But since the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, depending on the vectors, the minimal enclosing circle can vary.But the problem says \\"for every choice of 2023 unit vectors\\", so we need a radius r that works for any configuration. So, we need the minimal r such that, regardless of how the vectors are arranged, there exists a point p such that all subset sums lie within a disc of radius r centered at p.So, we need to find the maximum, over all configurations of vectors, of the minimal enclosing circle radius for the subset sums. Then, r is that maximum.So, to find the minimal r such that for any configuration, the minimal enclosing circle has radius at most r.Therefore, we need to find the maximum possible minimal enclosing circle radius over all configurations of 2023 unit vectors in the plane.Hmm, this seems related to some known result in geometry or combinatorics.Wait, perhaps it's related to the concept of the diameter of the set of subset sums. The diameter is the maximum distance between any two subset sums, and the minimal enclosing circle has radius at least half the diameter.But in our earlier example with two vectors in opposite directions, the diameter was 2, so the minimal enclosing circle had radius 1, which is half the diameter.Similarly, for n vectors aligned in a line, the diameter is n, so the minimal enclosing circle has radius n/2.But in the case where the vectors are arranged in all directions, the diameter could be larger? Or is it still n?Wait, no, because the maximum distance between any two subset sums is still bounded by the sum of all vectors in some direction, which is n.Wait, for example, if you have vectors pointing in all directions, the maximum distance between two subset sums would be the maximum norm of any subset sum, which is n, so the diameter is n, hence the minimal enclosing circle has radius n/2.Wait, but if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, how can the diameter be n? Because the diameter is the maximum distance between any two points in the set.If the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, the diameter could be larger than n, but actually, no, because each subset sum is a vector sum of some subset, and the maximum norm of any subset sum is n, so the maximum distance between any two subset sums is at most 2n, because the maximum distance between two points each at most n away from the origin is 2n.Wait, that's a good point. The maximum distance between any two subset sums is at most 2n, because each subset sum has norm at most n, so by the triangle inequality, the distance between any two subset sums is at most n + n = 2n.Therefore, the diameter of the set of subset sums is at most 2n, so the minimal enclosing circle has radius at most n.But in the case where all vectors are aligned, the diameter is n, so the minimal enclosing circle has radius n/2.In the case where vectors are arranged in opposite directions, the diameter is n, so the minimal enclosing circle has radius n/2.In the case where vectors are arranged in all directions, the diameter is 2n, so the minimal enclosing circle has radius n.Wait, so in that case, the radius would be n, which is larger than n/2.But wait, if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, the maximum distance between two subset sums could be up to 2n, so the minimal enclosing circle must have radius n.But that contradicts the earlier case where the radius was n/2.Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.Wait, let's think carefully. The diameter is the maximum distance between any two subset sums. If the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, then the maximum distance between two subset sums could be up to 2n, because each subset sum can be at most n away from the origin in opposite directions.Wait, but if all subset sums are within a disc of radius n centered at the origin, then the maximum distance between any two subset sums is at most 2n, achieved when one subset sum is at +n and another at -n.Therefore, the diameter is 2n, so the minimal enclosing circle must have radius n.But in the case where all vectors are aligned, the subset sums lie on a line from 0 to n, so the diameter is n, so the minimal enclosing circle has radius n/2.But in the case where the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, the diameter is 2n, so the minimal enclosing circle has radius n.Therefore, depending on the configuration of vectors, the minimal enclosing circle can have a radius ranging from n/2 to n.But the problem says \\"for every choice of 2023 unit vectors\\", so we need a radius r that works for any configuration. So, in the worst case, when the vectors are arranged such that the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, the minimal enclosing circle has radius n.But wait, is that the case? If the vectors are arranged in all directions, the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, but actually, no, because each subset sum is a vector sum of some subset, so the maximum norm is n, but the minimal enclosing circle can be centered somewhere else.Wait, for example, if the subset sums are spread out in all directions, the minimal enclosing circle is centered at the origin with radius n. But if we can choose the center, maybe we can find a better center.Wait, but if the subset sums are spread out in all directions, the minimal enclosing circle must have a radius of at least n, because the origin is one of the subset sums (the empty set), and the farthest subset sum is n away from the origin. So, if we center the circle at the origin, the radius must be at least n.But if we can choose another center, maybe we can reduce the radius.Wait, for example, if we have subset sums at the origin and at n, then the minimal enclosing circle is centered at n/2 with radius n/2.But if we have subset sums spread out in all directions, how can we choose a center to minimize the maximum distance to all subset sums?Wait, this seems like the problem of finding the smallest enclosing circle for a set of points, which is a well-known problem in computational geometry. The minimal enclosing circle can be determined by either two points (diametral circle) or three points on its boundary.But in our case, the set of subset sums is a very large set (2^2023 points), so it's not feasible to compute directly.But perhaps, regardless of the configuration, the minimal enclosing circle can be bounded by n/2.Wait, but earlier, I thought that if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, the minimal enclosing circle must have radius n, but that's only if we center it at the origin. If we can choose the center, maybe we can do better.Wait, for example, suppose we have subset sums at the origin and at n. Then, the minimal enclosing circle is centered at n/2 with radius n/2. Similarly, if we have subset sums at the origin and at -n, the minimal enclosing circle is centered at -n/2 with radius n/2.But if we have subset sums at both n and -n, then the minimal enclosing circle must have a radius of n, centered at the origin.Wait, so if the subset sums include both n and -n, then the minimal enclosing circle must have radius n, centered at the origin.But in our problem, the subset sums include the empty set, which is the origin, and the full sum, which is a vector of length up to n. So, if the full sum is at n, then the minimal enclosing circle must include both the origin and the full sum, so the radius must be at least n/2.But if the full sum is at n, and the origin is also a subset sum, then the minimal enclosing circle must have a radius of at least n/2, centered at n/2.But if the full sum is at n, and the origin is at 0, then the distance between them is n, so the minimal enclosing circle must have a radius of at least n/2.Wait, but if the full sum is at n, and the origin is at 0, then the minimal enclosing circle is centered at n/2 with radius n/2.But if the full sum is at some other point, say, in a different direction, then the minimal enclosing circle would still have to include the origin and that point, so the radius would be at least half the distance between them.But the distance between the origin and the full sum is n, so the minimal enclosing circle must have a radius of at least n/2.Therefore, regardless of the direction of the full sum, the minimal enclosing circle must have a radius of at least n/2.But in the case where the full sum is in a direction opposite to another subset sum, say, another subset sum is at -k, then the distance between -k and the full sum is n + k, so the minimal enclosing circle must have a radius of at least (n + k)/2.But k can be up to n, so the radius could be up to n.Wait, but if the subset sums include both n and -n, then the minimal enclosing circle must have a radius of n, centered at the origin.But in reality, the subset sums can't include both n and -n unless we have vectors arranged in opposite directions.Wait, if all vectors are arranged in one direction, the subset sums go from 0 to n, so the minimal enclosing circle is centered at n/2 with radius n/2.If some vectors are arranged in opposite directions, then the subset sums can include both positive and negative values, so the minimal enclosing circle must include both the origin and the full sum, but also other points in between.Wait, but if the full sum is at n, and the origin is at 0, then the minimal enclosing circle is centered at n/2 with radius n/2, regardless of other subset sums.But if there are subset sums in the opposite direction, say, at -k, then the distance from n/2 to -k is n/2 + k, which could be larger than n/2.Therefore, the radius would have to be at least n/2 + k.But k can be up to n, so the radius could be up to 3n/2.Wait, that can't be, because the maximum norm of any subset sum is n, so the distance from n/2 to any subset sum is at most n/2 + n = 3n/2, but that would mean the radius is 3n/2, which seems too large.Wait, but in reality, if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, the minimal enclosing circle can be centered somewhere to minimize the maximum distance.Wait, perhaps the minimal enclosing circle is centered at the centroid of all subset sums, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Let's consider that the set of subset sums is symmetric in some way.Wait, actually, for any subset S, the subset sum is ( sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i ), and the subset sum for the complement of S is ( sum_{i notin S} mathbf{v}_i ). So, the sum of these two subset sums is the total sum ( sum_{i=1}^{2023} mathbf{v}_i ).Therefore, for any subset S, ( sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i + sum_{i notin S} mathbf{v}_i = mathbf{T} ), where ( mathbf{T} ) is the total sum.Therefore, ( sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i = mathbf{T} - sum_{i notin S} mathbf{v}_i ).This implies that the set of subset sums is symmetric with respect to ( mathbf{T}/2 ). That is, for every subset sum ( mathbf{s} ), there is another subset sum ( mathbf{T} - mathbf{s} ).Therefore, the set of subset sums is symmetric about ( mathbf{T}/2 ). Therefore, the minimal enclosing circle must be centered at ( mathbf{T}/2 ), because of this symmetry.Therefore, the minimal enclosing circle is centered at ( mathbf{T}/2 ), and the radius is the maximum distance from ( mathbf{T}/2 ) to any subset sum.But since ( mathbf{T} ) is the total sum, which has norm at most 2023, the maximum distance from ( mathbf{T}/2 ) to any subset sum is at most ( |mathbf{T}/2 - mathbf{s}| leq |mathbf{T}/2| + |mathbf{s}| leq 2023/2 + 2023 = 3*2023/2 ), which is too large.Wait, but actually, using the triangle inequality, ( |mathbf{T}/2 - mathbf{s}| leq |mathbf{T}/2| + |mathbf{s}| ), but that's not tight.Wait, actually, since ( mathbf{s} ) and ( mathbf{T} - mathbf{s} ) are both subset sums, and they are symmetric with respect to ( mathbf{T}/2 ), the maximum distance from ( mathbf{T}/2 ) to any subset sum is equal to the maximum norm of ( mathbf{s} - mathbf{T}/2 ).But ( mathbf{s} ) can be any subset sum, so ( mathbf{s} - mathbf{T}/2 = sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i - frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{2023} mathbf{v}_i = frac{1}{2} sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i - frac{1}{2} sum_{i notin S} mathbf{v}_i ).Therefore, ( mathbf{s} - mathbf{T}/2 = frac{1}{2} sum_{i in S} mathbf{v}_i - frac{1}{2} sum_{i notin S} mathbf{v}_i = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{2023} (-1)^{i notin S} mathbf{v}_i ).So, this is equivalent to half of the sum of all vectors, each multiplied by either +1 or -1, depending on whether they are in S or not.Therefore, ( |mathbf{s} - mathbf{T}/2| = frac{1}{2} | sum_{i=1}^{2023} epsilon_i mathbf{v}_i | ), where ( epsilon_i in { -1, +1 } ).Therefore, the maximum norm is ( frac{1}{2} times ) the maximum norm of any combination of the vectors with coefficients ±1.But the maximum norm of such a combination is known as the discrepancy of the set of vectors. However, I'm not sure about the exact value.Wait, but in the case where all vectors are aligned, say, in the same direction, then the maximum norm of ( sum_{i=1}^{2023} epsilon_i mathbf{v}_i ) is 2023, so the maximum distance from ( mathbf{T}/2 ) is 2023/2.Similarly, if the vectors are arranged in opposite directions, say, k in one direction and 2023 - k in the opposite, then the maximum norm of ( sum_{i=1}^{2023} epsilon_i mathbf{v}_i ) is 2023, so again, the maximum distance is 2023/2.Wait, but if the vectors are arranged in all directions, the maximum norm of ( sum_{i=1}^{2023} epsilon_i mathbf{v}_i ) could be larger?Wait, no, because each vector is a unit vector, so the maximum norm is at most 2023, regardless of their directions.Therefore, the maximum norm of ( sum_{i=1}^{2023} epsilon_i mathbf{v}_i ) is 2023, so the maximum distance from ( mathbf{T}/2 ) is 2023/2.Therefore, the minimal enclosing circle is centered at ( mathbf{T}/2 ) with radius 2023/2.Therefore, regardless of the configuration of the vectors, the minimal enclosing circle has radius 2023/2.Therefore, the minimal such r is 2023/2.Wait, but earlier I thought that if the subset sums can be anywhere in the plane, the minimal enclosing circle would have a larger radius, but with this symmetry argument, it seems that the radius is always 2023/2.Therefore, the answer should be ( boxed{dfrac{2023}{2}} ).**Final Answer**The smallest positive real number ( r ) is ( boxed{dfrac{2023}{2}} )."},{"question":"The equation x^2 + y^2 - 6x = 0 represents a circle. The coordinates of the center of the circle are ________; the radius is __________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation here: (x^2 + y^2 - 6x = 0). It says it represents a circle, and I need to find the center and the radius. Hmm, I remember that the general equation of a circle is something like ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2), where ((h, k)) is the center and (r) is the radius. So, I need to manipulate the given equation to match this standard form.First, let me write down the given equation again: (x^2 + y^2 - 6x = 0). I notice that there are (x^2) and (y^2) terms, which is good because that's what the standard circle equation has. But there's also a linear term in (x), which is (-6x). I think I need to complete the square for the (x) terms to get it into the standard form.Completing the square... let me recall how that works. For a quadratic expression like (x^2 + bx), you can complete the square by adding ((b/2)^2). So, in this case, the coefficient of (x) is (-6), so (b = -6). Therefore, ((b/2)^2 = (-6/2)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9). So, I need to add 9 to complete the square for the (x) terms.But wait, if I add 9 to the equation, I have to balance it by adding 9 to the other side as well, right? Because I can't just change the equation without keeping it equal. Let me try that.Starting with the equation:(x^2 + y^2 - 6x = 0)Let me group the (x) terms together:((x^2 - 6x) + y^2 = 0)Now, to complete the square for (x^2 - 6x), I add 9 inside the equation:((x^2 - 6x + 9) + y^2 = 0 + 9)Simplifying the left side, the (x) terms become a perfect square:((x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 9)Okay, now this looks like the standard equation of a circle. Comparing it to ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2), I can see that (h = 3), (k = 0), and (r^2 = 9). Therefore, the center of the circle is at ((3, 0)) and the radius is (sqrt{9} = 3).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started with the equation, grouped the (x) terms, completed the square by adding 9, and then balanced the equation by adding 9 to the other side. That seems right. Then I rewrote the (x) terms as a squared binomial, which is correct because ((x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9). The (y^2) term is already there without any linear term, so (k = 0). The radius squared is 9, so the radius is 3. Yeah, that all checks out.I think I got it. The center is at (3, 0) and the radius is 3 units. Let me just visualize this in my mind. The circle is centered at (3, 0), which is 3 units to the right of the origin on the x-axis. The radius is 3, so it should pass through the origin because the distance from (3, 0) to (0, 0) is 3, which is equal to the radius. So, the circle touches the origin. That makes sense because if I plug in (0, 0) into the original equation, it satisfies: (0 + 0 - 0 = 0). So, yes, (0, 0) is on the circle.Another point to check: if I plug in (6, 0), which is 3 units to the right of the center, the equation becomes (6^2 + 0^2 - 6*6 = 36 + 0 - 36 = 0). So, (6, 0) is also on the circle, which is consistent with the radius being 3. Similarly, if I plug in (3, 3), it should be on the circle. Let's see: (3^2 + 3^2 - 6*3 = 9 + 9 - 18 = 0). Yep, that works too. So, all these points are on the circle, which confirms that the center and radius are correct.I think I'm confident with this answer now. The center is (3, 0) and the radius is 3.**Final Answer**The coordinates of the center of the circle are boxed{(3, 0)}; the radius is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = x^2 + abx + a + 2b. If f(0) = 4, then the maximum value of f(1) is _______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function is given as f(x) = x² + abx + a + 2b. They tell me that f(0) = 4, and I need to find the maximum value of f(1). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me recall what f(0) means. When x is 0, the function simplifies because any term with x in it becomes zero. So, plugging x = 0 into f(x):f(0) = (0)² + ab*(0) + a + 2b = 0 + 0 + a + 2b. So, f(0) = a + 2b. But they say f(0) = 4, so that gives me the equation:a + 2b = 4.Okay, so that's one equation involving a and b. Now, I need to find f(1). Let me compute that. Plugging x = 1 into f(x):f(1) = (1)² + ab*(1) + a + 2b = 1 + ab + a + 2b.So, f(1) = 1 + ab + a + 2b.Hmm, so I have f(1) in terms of a and b, and I also have a relationship between a and b from f(0). Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute it into f(1) to make it a function of a single variable, and then find its maximum.From the equation a + 2b = 4, I can solve for a:a = 4 - 2b.Alternatively, I can solve for b:2b = 4 - a => b = (4 - a)/2.Either way, I can substitute into f(1). Let me choose to express a in terms of b because in f(1), the term ab is a product, so maybe it's easier to substitute a.So, a = 4 - 2b. Let's plug that into f(1):f(1) = 1 + (4 - 2b)*b + (4 - 2b) + 2b.Let me compute each term step by step.First, (4 - 2b)*b = 4b - 2b².Then, (4 - 2b) is just 4 - 2b.And 2b is 2b.So, putting it all together:f(1) = 1 + (4b - 2b²) + (4 - 2b) + 2b.Now, let's combine like terms.First, constants: 1 + 4 = 5.Next, terms with b: 4b - 2b + 2b. Let me compute that:4b - 2b is 2b, and then 2b more is 4b. Wait, that seems off. Wait, 4b - 2b + 2b.Wait, 4b - 2b is 2b, and then +2b is 4b. So, total of 4b.Then, the quadratic term: -2b².So, putting it all together, f(1) = 5 + 4b - 2b².So, f(1) is a quadratic function in terms of b: f(1) = -2b² + 4b + 5.Now, since this is a quadratic function, it's a parabola. The coefficient of b² is -2, which is negative, so the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex is the maximum point.So, to find the maximum value of f(1), I need to find the vertex of this parabola.The vertex of a parabola given by y = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, our variable is b, so let me adjust the notation to avoid confusion.Wait, actually, in the standard form, it's y = Ab² + Bb + C, so the vertex is at b = -B/(2A). In our case, A is -2, B is 4.So, the value of b at the vertex is:b = -B/(2A) = -4/(2*(-2)) = -4/(-4) = 1.So, the maximum occurs at b = 1.Now, let's compute f(1) at b = 1.f(1) = -2*(1)² + 4*(1) + 5 = -2 + 4 + 5 = ( -2 + 4 ) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7.So, the maximum value of f(1) is 7.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, f(0) = a + 2b = 4, so a = 4 - 2b.Then, f(1) = 1 + ab + a + 2b.Substituting a = 4 - 2b:f(1) = 1 + (4 - 2b)*b + (4 - 2b) + 2b.Compute (4 - 2b)*b: 4b - 2b².Then, (4 - 2b): 4 - 2b.So, f(1) = 1 + 4b - 2b² + 4 - 2b + 2b.Combine constants: 1 + 4 = 5.Combine b terms: 4b - 2b + 2b = 4b.Quadratic term: -2b².So, f(1) = -2b² + 4b + 5. Correct.Then, vertex at b = -B/(2A) = -4/(2*(-2)) = 1. Correct.Then, f(1) at b=1: -2(1) + 4(1) +5 = -2 +4 +5=7. Correct.So, the maximum value is 7.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using calculus, treating f(1) as a function of b and finding its maximum by taking the derivative.Let me try that.Given f(1) = -2b² + 4b + 5.Take derivative with respect to b: f'(1) = -4b + 4.Set derivative equal to zero for critical points:-4b + 4 = 0 => -4b = -4 => b = 1.So, critical point at b=1. Then, since the coefficient of b² is negative, it's a maximum.Compute f(1) at b=1: same as before, 7.So, same result.Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of completing the square.Starting with f(1) = -2b² + 4b +5.Factor out -2 from the first two terms:f(1) = -2(b² - 2b) +5.Now, complete the square inside the parentheses:b² - 2b = (b - 1)^2 - 1.So, substitute back:f(1) = -2[(b - 1)^2 - 1] +5 = -2(b -1)^2 + 2 +5 = -2(b -1)^2 +7.So, f(1) = -2(b -1)^2 +7.Since the square term is always non-negative, the maximum occurs when (b -1)^2 is zero, i.e., when b=1. Then, f(1) = 7.Same result again.So, all methods confirm that the maximum value is 7.Just to make sure, let me check if there are any constraints on a and b. The problem doesn't specify any, so a and b can be any real numbers as long as a + 2b =4. So, b can be any real number, and a is determined accordingly.Therefore, since the function f(1) is a quadratic in b with a maximum, and we found the maximum value at b=1, which is 7, that should be the answer.I think that's thorough enough. I considered multiple methods: substitution, calculus, completing the square, and all lead to the same conclusion. So, I feel confident that the maximum value of f(1) is 7.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( f(1) ) is boxed{7}."},{"question":"Bobby has three squares of fabric that he will turn into a flag.

It's given that ( f(1 + x) = f(1 - x) ) for all ( x ), and also that ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing on the interval ([m, +infty)). I need to find the minimum value of the real number ( m ).Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, the function is ( f(x) = 2^{|x - a|} ). So, it's an exponential function with base 2, and the exponent is the absolute value of ( x - a ). I know that absolute value functions create V-shaped graphs, so this function will have a V-shape as well, but it's exponential, so it will increase rapidly on either side of the vertex.Next, the condition given is ( f(1 + x) = f(1 - x) ) for all ( x ). That seems like a symmetry condition. Let me think about what kind of symmetry this is. If I replace ( x ) with ( 1 + x ) and ( 1 - x ), it looks like the function is symmetric about the line ( x = 1 ). So, the graph of ( f(x) ) should be symmetric with respect to the vertical line ( x = 1 ).Since ( f(x) ) is symmetric about ( x = 1 ), the vertex of the V-shape (which is the minimum point of the function because the exponent is absolute value) should lie on this line. The vertex of ( f(x) = 2^{|x - a|} ) is at ( x = a ). So, for the function to be symmetric about ( x = 1 ), the vertex must be at ( x = 1 ). Therefore, ( a = 1 ).Wait, let me verify that. If ( a = 1 ), then ( f(x) = 2^{|x - 1|} ). Let's check the symmetry condition:( f(1 + x) = 2^{|(1 + x) - 1|} = 2^{|x|} )Similarly, ( f(1 - x) = 2^{|(1 - x) - 1|} = 2^{|-x|} = 2^{|x|} )Yes, so ( f(1 + x) = f(1 - x) ) holds true. So, ( a = 1 ).Alright, so now we know ( f(x) = 2^{|x - 1|} ). Now, the next part is about the function being monotonically increasing on ([m, +infty)). We need to find the minimum value of ( m ).First, let me recall what it means for a function to be monotonically increasing. A function is monotonically increasing on an interval if, as ( x ) increases, the function's value does not decrease. So, for all ( x_1 < x_2 ) in the interval, ( f(x_1) leq f(x_2) ).Given that ( f(x) = 2^{|x - 1|} ), let's analyze its behavior. The function ( |x - 1| ) is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at ( x = 1 ). To the right of ( x = 1 ), the expression inside the absolute value becomes positive, so ( |x - 1| = x - 1 ). To the left of ( x = 1 ), it becomes negative, so ( |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = 1 - x ).Therefore, ( f(x) ) can be written as a piecewise function:- For ( x geq 1 ), ( f(x) = 2^{x - 1} )- For ( x < 1 ), ( f(x) = 2^{1 - x} )Now, let's analyze the monotonicity of each piece.For ( x geq 1 ), ( f(x) = 2^{x - 1} ). Since the base 2 is greater than 1, this is an exponential growth function. Therefore, it's monotonically increasing on ( [1, +infty) ).For ( x < 1 ), ( f(x) = 2^{1 - x} ). Let's rewrite this as ( 2^{-(x - 1)} ). Since the exponent is negative, this is equivalent to ( (1/2)^{x - 1} ). The base ( 1/2 ) is less than 1, so this is an exponential decay function. Therefore, it's monotonically decreasing on ( (-infty, 1) ).So, putting it all together, ( f(x) ) decreases from ( -infty ) up to ( x = 1 ), and then increases from ( x = 1 ) to ( +infty ). Therefore, the function is decreasing on ( (-infty, 1) ) and increasing on ( [1, +infty) ).But the problem says that ( f(x) ) is monotonically increasing on ( [m, +infty) ). So, we need to find the smallest ( m ) such that from ( m ) onwards, the function is increasing.From our analysis, the function starts increasing at ( x = 1 ). So, if we take ( m = 1 ), then ( f(x) ) is increasing on ( [1, +infty) ). If we take ( m ) less than 1, say ( m = 0 ), then on ( [0, +infty) ), the function is decreasing on ( [0,1) ) and increasing on ( [1, +infty) ). Therefore, it's not monotonically increasing on the entire interval ( [0, +infty) ).Hence, the minimal ( m ) is 1, because starting from 1, the function is increasing onwards, and any ( m ) less than 1 would include a region where the function is decreasing.Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that the function could be increasing on some interval starting before 1? For example, if ( m ) is less than 1, but the function is increasing on ( [m, +infty) ). But since the function is decreasing on ( (-infty, 1) ), any interval starting before 1 would include a decreasing part. Therefore, the function cannot be increasing on ( [m, +infty) ) unless ( m geq 1 ).Therefore, the minimal ( m ) is 1.But just to be thorough, let's also consider the derivative of ( f(x) ) to confirm the increasing/decreasing behavior.For ( x > 1 ), ( f(x) = 2^{x - 1} ). The derivative is ( f'(x) = ln(2) cdot 2^{x - 1} ), which is positive because ( ln(2) > 0 ) and ( 2^{x - 1} > 0 ). So, the function is increasing for ( x > 1 ).For ( x < 1 ), ( f(x) = 2^{1 - x} ). The derivative is ( f'(x) = -ln(2) cdot 2^{1 - x} ), which is negative because ( -ln(2) < 0 ) and ( 2^{1 - x} > 0 ). So, the function is decreasing for ( x < 1 ).At ( x = 1 ), the function has a minimum point because it changes from decreasing to increasing. So, the function is not differentiable at ( x = 1 ), but the left-hand derivative is negative and the right-hand derivative is positive, confirming the behavior.Therefore, the function is decreasing on ( (-infty, 1) ) and increasing on ( (1, +infty) ). So, the minimal ( m ) such that ( f(x) ) is increasing on ( [m, +infty) ) is ( m = 1 ).Wait, but the question says \\"the minimum value of the real number ( m )\\". So, is 1 the minimal value? Or is there a smaller ( m ) where the function is still increasing on ( [m, +infty) )?But as I thought earlier, if ( m ) is less than 1, say ( m = 0.5 ), then on ( [0.5, +infty) ), the function is decreasing from 0.5 to 1 and increasing from 1 onwards. So, it's not monotonically increasing on the entire interval ( [0.5, +infty) ). Therefore, 1 is indeed the minimal ( m ).Alternatively, if the function were increasing on some interval that starts before 1 but skips the decreasing part, but since the function is defined for all real numbers, and the interval ( [m, +infty) ) must include all points from ( m ) onwards, we can't skip the decreasing part. Therefore, ( m ) must be at least 1.Hence, the minimum value of ( m ) is 1.**Final Answer**The minimum value of ( m ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"There are 30 people in my math class.  12 of them have cool dads, 15 of them have cool moms, and 9 of them have cool dads and cool moms.

Additionally, 9 students have both cool dads and cool moms.To find out how many students have both cool dads and cool moms, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The number of students with either a cool dad or a cool mom is the sum of those with cool dads and those with cool moms minus those with both.So, the number of students with either a cool dad or a cool mom is 12 + 15 - 9 = 18.Finally, to determine how many students have neither cool dads nor cool moms, I subtract the number of students with either from the total number of students: 30 - 18 = 12.Therefore, 12 students have both uncool dads and uncool moms."},{"question":"Convert the binary number 110110_2 to a decimal number.","answer":"To convert the binary number 110110₂ to a decimal number, I will start by identifying the place value of each digit.

Round your answer to two decimal places.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the area of triangle ABC with the given vertices: A at (0,0), B at (1424233, 2848467), and C at (1424234, 2848469). Hmm, that seems like a pretty large triangle, especially with those big coordinates. I remember there are a few ways to calculate the area of a triangle when you know the coordinates of its vertices. One common method is using the shoelace formula, which I think is also called Gauss's area formula. Let me recall how that works.The shoelace formula takes the coordinates of the vertices and essentially multiplies them in a crisscross pattern, subtracts the products, and then takes half the absolute value of that result. The formula is something like this:Area = (1/2) * |(x₁y₂ + x₂y₃ + x₃y₁) - (y₁x₂ + y₂x₃ + y₃x₁)|Let me write that down with the given points. So, point A is (0,0), which is (x₁, y₁). Point B is (1424233, 2848467), so that's (x₂, y₂). Point C is (1424234, 2848469), which is (x₃, y₃).Plugging these into the formula:First part: x₁y₂ + x₂y₃ + x₃y₁= (0)(2848467) + (1424233)(2848469) + (1424234)(0)= 0 + (1424233 * 2848469) + 0Second part: y₁x₂ + y₂x₃ + y₃x₁= (0)(1424233) + (2848467)(1424234) + (2848469)(0)= 0 + (2848467 * 1424234) + 0So, the area is (1/2) * |(1424233 * 2848469) - (2848467 * 1424234)|Wait a second, that looks a bit complicated with those huge numbers. I need to compute these products. Maybe I can find a way to simplify this without having to multiply those massive numbers directly.Let me look at the coordinates more closely. Points B and C are very close to each other. Let me see how close:Point B: (1424233, 2848467)Point C: (1424234, 2848469)So, the x-coordinate of C is just 1 more than B's x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate of C is 2 more than B's y-coordinate. That seems like a small difference. Maybe the triangle is almost a right triangle or something? Hmm, not necessarily, but perhaps the area can be found using vectors or the determinant method.Wait, the shoelace formula is essentially the determinant method. So, maybe I can compute the determinant of a matrix formed by the coordinates.Alternatively, since points B and C are so close, maybe the area is small? But given the coordinates, it might not be. Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors. The area of the triangle can be found by half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC.Let me try that approach.First, find vectors AB and AC.Vector AB is from A to B: (1424233 - 0, 2848467 - 0) = (1424233, 2848467)Vector AC is from A to C: (1424234 - 0, 2848469 - 0) = (1424234, 2848469)The cross product of AB and AC is (1424233)(2848469) - (2848467)(1424234). Wait, that's exactly the same as the shoelace formula! So, the area is half the absolute value of that cross product.So, regardless of the method, I end up with the same calculation. So, I need to compute (1424233 * 2848469) - (2848467 * 1424234). Let me denote this as:Let me compute 1424233 * 2848469 first. Hmm, that's a huge number. Maybe I can factor some parts or find a pattern.Wait, let me note that 2848467 is equal to 2 * 1424233 + 1. Let me check:2 * 1424233 = 2848466, so 2848467 is 2848466 + 1, so yes, 2848467 = 2*1424233 + 1.Similarly, 2848469 is 2*1424234 + 1, because 2*1424234 = 2848468, so 2848469 is 2848468 +1.So, let me denote x = 1424233, then 1424234 = x + 1.Similarly, 2848467 = 2x + 1, and 2848469 = 2(x + 1) + 1 = 2x + 3.So, substituting these into the products:First product: x * (2x + 3) = 2x² + 3xSecond product: (2x + 1) * (x + 1) = 2x(x + 1) + 1(x + 1) = 2x² + 2x + x + 1 = 2x² + 3x + 1So, the difference between the first product and the second product is:(2x² + 3x) - (2x² + 3x + 1) = -1Wait, so the cross product is -1, so the area is (1/2)*| -1 | = 0.5Is that right? Let me verify.So, if I let x = 1424233, then:First term: x * (2x + 3) = 2x² + 3xSecond term: (2x + 1) * (x + 1) = 2x² + 3x + 1Subtracting: (2x² + 3x) - (2x² + 3x + 1) = -1So, the determinant is -1, so the area is 0.5.Wow, that's surprisingly simple. So, despite the large coordinates, the area is just 0.5 square units.But wait, let me double-check my substitution.Given that:Point B: (x, 2x + 1)Point C: (x + 1, 2(x + 1) + 1) = (x + 1, 2x + 3)So, vectors AB = (x, 2x + 1)Vector AC = (x + 1, 2x + 3)Cross product AB x AC = x*(2x + 3) - (2x + 1)*(x + 1)= 2x² + 3x - [2x(x + 1) + 1(x + 1)]= 2x² + 3x - [2x² + 2x + x + 1]= 2x² + 3x - (2x² + 3x + 1)= 2x² + 3x - 2x² - 3x - 1= -1Yes, that's correct. So, the cross product is indeed -1, so the area is 0.5.Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 0.5 square units.Wait, but the problem says to round to two decimal places. So, 0.5 is already exact, but if I have to write it as 0.50, that would be two decimal places.So, the area is 0.50.But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to compute this.Alternatively, since points B and C are so close, maybe the triangle is almost a line, but with a slight height. Let me compute the distance between B and C, and then see if I can compute the area as (base * height)/2.First, distance between B and C:Coordinates of B: (1424233, 2848467)Coordinates of C: (1424234, 2848469)So, the difference in x is 1, and the difference in y is 2.So, distance BC is sqrt(1² + 2²) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.23607Now, if I can find the height from point A to the line BC, then the area would be (base * height)/2.But wait, point A is at (0,0). So, the height would be the perpendicular distance from A to the line BC.Alternatively, since we already computed the area as 0.5, maybe we can check if that's consistent.Wait, if the area is 0.5, then (base * height)/2 = 0.5So, base is sqrt(5), so height = (0.5 * 2)/sqrt(5) = 1/sqrt(5) ≈ 0.4472But let's compute the perpendicular distance from A to line BC.The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²)First, let's find the equation of line BC.Points B and C: (1424233, 2848467) and (1424234, 2848469)Slope of BC: (2848469 - 2848467)/(1424234 - 1424233) = 2/1 = 2So, the slope is 2. Therefore, the equation of line BC is y - y1 = m(x - x1)Using point B: y - 2848467 = 2(x - 1424233)Simplify:y = 2x - 2*1424233 + 2848467Compute 2*1424233: that's 2848466So, y = 2x - 2848466 + 2848467 = 2x + 1So, the equation of line BC is y = 2x + 1To write it in standard form: 2x - y + 1 = 0So, a = 2, b = -1, c = 1Now, distance from A(0,0) to this line is |2*0 + (-1)*0 + 1| / sqrt(2² + (-1)²) = |1| / sqrt(4 + 1) = 1 / sqrt(5) ≈ 0.4472So, the height is 1/sqrt(5), and the base is sqrt(5). So, area is (sqrt(5) * 1/sqrt(5))/2 = (1)/2 = 0.5Yep, that's consistent with the shoelace formula result.So, regardless of the method, the area is 0.5 square units.Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is 0.50 when rounded to two decimal places.**Final Answer**The area of triangle ( ABC ) is boxed{0.50}."},{"question":"Find the number of natural numbers ( k ), not exceeding 291000, such that ( k^2 - 1 ) is divisible by 291.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the number of natural numbers ( k ) not exceeding 291,000 such that ( k^2 - 1 ) is divisible by 291. Hmm, that means ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{291} ). I remember that congruences like this can sometimes be broken down using the Chinese Remainder Theorem if the modulus can be factored into coprime numbers. Let me see, 291 is equal to... let's factorize it.291 divided by 3 is 97, right? So, 291 = 3 × 97. Both 3 and 97 are prime numbers, so they are coprime. That means I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here. So, if ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{3} ) and ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{97} ), then ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{291} ). First, let me solve ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{3} ). The possible residues modulo 3 are 0, 1, 2. Let's square them:- ( 0^2 = 0 mod{3} )- ( 1^2 = 1 mod{3} )- ( 2^2 = 4 equiv 1 mod{3} )So, the solutions modulo 3 are ( k equiv 1 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 2 mod{3} ). So, there are two solutions modulo 3.Now, moving on to modulo 97. I need to solve ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{97} ). Since 97 is a prime, the equation ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{97} ) has exactly two solutions: ( k equiv 1 mod{97} ) and ( k equiv -1 mod{97} ), which is ( k equiv 96 mod{97} ). So, two solutions modulo 97.By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since 3 and 97 are coprime, the number of solutions modulo 291 is the product of the number of solutions modulo 3 and modulo 97. So, 2 × 2 = 4 solutions modulo 291.Therefore, there are 4 solutions modulo 291. That means in every block of 291 consecutive numbers, there are 4 numbers ( k ) such that ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{291} ).Now, the problem asks for the number of such ( k ) not exceeding 291,000. So, 291,000 divided by 291 is 1000. So, there are 1000 blocks of 291 numbers each. Since each block contributes 4 solutions, the total number of solutions is 1000 × 4 = 4000.Wait, but hold on. I should check if 291,000 is exactly divisible by 291. Let me compute 291 × 1000: 291 × 1000 = 291,000. Yes, so it's exactly 1000 blocks. So, each block contributes 4 solutions, so 4000 in total.But just to make sure, let me think about whether the solutions in each block are unique and don't overlap or something. Since the modulus is 291, each solution in the next block is 291 more than the previous one, so they don't overlap. So, 4 solutions per 291 numbers, 1000 blocks, so 4000 total.Wait, but let me also confirm by thinking about the structure of the solutions. The solutions modulo 291 are 4 distinct residues. So, in each block, exactly 4 numbers satisfy the condition. So, over 1000 blocks, it's 4000.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the density of solutions is 4/291, so the total number up to N is approximately (4/291) × N. Since N is 291,000, which is 291 × 1000, so (4/291) × 291,000 = 4 × 1000 = 4000. So, that also gives 4000.Therefore, I think the answer is 4000.But just to be thorough, let me consider the actual solutions. The four solutions modulo 291 can be found by solving the congruences:1. ( k equiv 1 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 1 mod{97} )2. ( k equiv 1 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 96 mod{97} )3. ( k equiv 2 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 1 mod{97} )4. ( k equiv 2 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 96 mod{97} )Each of these will give a unique solution modulo 291. Let me compute them to verify.First solution: ( k equiv 1 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 1 mod{97} ). Since 1 is congruent to 1 modulo both, so k ≡ 1 mod 291.Second solution: ( k equiv 1 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 96 mod{97} ). Let me solve this system. Let k = 97m + 96. Then, 97m + 96 ≡ 1 mod 3. Since 97 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 1×m + 96 ≡ m + 0 ≡ 1 mod 3. So, m ≡ 1 mod 3. So, m = 3n + 1. Therefore, k = 97(3n + 1) + 96 = 291n + 97 + 96 = 291n + 193. So, the solution is k ≡ 193 mod 291.Third solution: ( k equiv 2 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 1 mod{97} ). Let k = 97m + 1. Then, 97m + 1 ≡ 2 mod 3. 97 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 1×m + 1 ≡ m + 1 ≡ 2 mod 3. So, m ≡ 1 mod 3. So, m = 3n + 1. Therefore, k = 97(3n + 1) + 1 = 291n + 97 + 1 = 291n + 98. So, k ≡ 98 mod 291.Fourth solution: ( k equiv 2 mod{3} ) and ( k equiv 96 mod{97} ). Let k = 97m + 96. Then, 97m + 96 ≡ 2 mod 3. 97 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 1×m + 96 ≡ m + 0 ≡ 2 mod 3. So, m ≡ 2 mod 3. So, m = 3n + 2. Therefore, k = 97(3n + 2) + 96 = 291n + 194 + 96 = 291n + 290. So, k ≡ 290 mod 291.So, the four solutions modulo 291 are k ≡ 1, 98, 193, 290 mod 291. So, in each block of 291 numbers, these four residues will satisfy ( k^2 equiv 1 mod{291} ).Therefore, in each block of 291 numbers, 4 numbers satisfy the condition. Since 291,000 is exactly 1000 blocks, the total number is 4 × 1000 = 4000.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 4000.**Final Answer**The number of such natural numbers ( k ) is boxed{4000}."},{"question":"The 2-digit integers from 19 to 92 are written consecutively to form the integer N=192021cdots9192. Suppose that 3^k is the highest power of 3 that is a factor of N. What is k?text{(A) } 0quad text{(B) } 1quad text{(C) } 2quad text{(D) } 3quad text{(E) more than } 3","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where they take all the two-digit integers from 19 up to 92 and write them one after another to form a big number N. Then, they want to find the highest power of 3, say 3^k, that divides N. The options are from 0 to more than 3, so I need to figure out what k is.First off, I remember that to check if a number is divisible by 3 or 9, you can add up all its digits and see if that sum is divisible by 3 or 9. For higher powers of 3, like 27 or 81, it's a bit more complicated, but maybe I can start with the basics.So, the number N is formed by concatenating numbers from 19 to 92. Let me figure out how many numbers that is. Starting at 19 and ending at 92. So, 92 minus 19 is 73, but since both ends are inclusive, I think it's 73 + 1 = 74 numbers. Each of these is a two-digit number, so N has 74 * 2 = 148 digits. That's a pretty long number!Since I need to find the highest power of 3 that divides N, I should first compute the sum of all the digits of N. If the sum is divisible by 3, then N is divisible by 3. If the sum is divisible by 9, then N is divisible by 9, and so on.So, my plan is to compute the sum of all digits in N. To do that, I can break it down into the sum of the tens digits and the sum of the units digits across all the numbers from 19 to 92.Let me list out the numbers from 19 to 92. Each number is two digits, so each has a tens digit and a units digit. For example, 19 has tens digit 1 and units digit 9, 20 has tens digit 2 and units digit 0, and so on up to 92.I think it's easier to compute the sum of the tens digits and the sum of the units digits separately.First, let's figure out how the tens digits change. Starting from 19, the tens digit is 1. Then from 20 to 29, the tens digit is 2. Then 30 to 39 is 3, and so on, up to 90 to 92, which is 9.Wait, hold on. 19 is a special case because it's the only number in the 10s in this range. Then 20 to 29 is the 20s, 30 to 39 is the 30s, etc., up to 90 to 92.So, the tens digits go from 1, then 2 repeated 10 times (from 20 to 29), 3 repeated 10 times, and so on up to 9, but only repeated 3 times because we stop at 92.Wait, actually, 90 to 92 is three numbers: 90, 91, 92. So, the tens digit 9 appears 3 times.Similarly, the other tens digits from 2 to 8 appear 10 times each, right? Because 20-29 is 10 numbers, 30-39 is another 10, etc., up to 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then 90-92 is 3 numbers.But wait, starting from 19, which is in the 10s. So, 19 is just one number with tens digit 1. Then 20-29 is 10 numbers with tens digit 2, 30-39 is 10 numbers with tens digit 3, and so on until 90-92, which is 3 numbers with tens digit 9.So, let me count how many times each tens digit appears:- Tens digit 1: 1 time (only 19)- Tens digit 2: 10 times (20-29)- Tens digit 3: 10 times (30-39)- Tens digit 4: 10 times (40-49)- Tens digit 5: 10 times (50-59)- Tens digit 6: 10 times (60-69)- Tens digit 7: 10 times (70-79)- Tens digit 8: 10 times (80-89)- Tens digit 9: 3 times (90-92)So, that's correct. So, the sum of the tens digits is:1*1 + 2*10 + 3*10 + 4*10 + 5*10 + 6*10 + 7*10 + 8*10 + 9*3Let me compute that:1*1 = 12*10 = 203*10 = 304*10 = 405*10 = 506*10 = 607*10 = 708*10 = 809*3 = 27Now, adding all these up:1 + 20 = 2121 + 30 = 5151 + 40 = 9191 + 50 = 141141 + 60 = 201201 + 70 = 271271 + 80 = 351351 + 27 = 378So, the sum of the tens digits is 378.Now, let's compute the sum of the units digits.This is a bit trickier because the units digits cycle from 0 to 9 for each tens group, except for the last group which is only up to 2.So, starting from 19, which has units digit 9.Then, 20-29: units digits 0-9.30-39: units digits 0-9....80-89: units digits 0-9.90-92: units digits 0,1,2.So, let's break it down:- For 19: units digit is 9.- For 20-29: units digits 0 through 9, so sum is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45.- Similarly, for 30-39: same as above, sum is 45.Same for 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89: each of these contributes 45.Then, for 90-92: units digits are 0,1,2, so sum is 0+1+2=3.So, let's compute:First, 19 contributes 9.Then, how many groups of 10 numbers (each contributing 45) do we have?From 20-29 to 80-89: that's 7 groups (20s, 30s, ..., 80s). Each contributes 45.Then, 90-92 contributes 3.So, the total sum of units digits is:9 (from 19) + 7*45 (from 20-89) + 3 (from 90-92)Compute that:7*45: 45*7 = 315So, 9 + 315 = 324324 + 3 = 327So, the sum of the units digits is 327.Therefore, the total sum of all digits in N is sum of tens digits + sum of units digits = 378 + 327.Compute that:378 + 327: 300 + 300 = 600, 78 + 27 = 105, so total is 600 + 105 = 705.So, the total digit sum is 705.Now, to find the highest power of 3 that divides N, we can check the divisibility by 3, 9, 27, 81, etc.First, check if 705 is divisible by 3: 7 + 0 + 5 = 12, which is divisible by 3, so 705 is divisible by 3. Therefore, N is divisible by 3.Next, check if 705 is divisible by 9: 7 + 0 + 5 = 12, which is not divisible by 9, so 705 is not divisible by 9. Therefore, N is not divisible by 9.Wait, but hold on. Is that the correct approach? Because N is a number, not the sum of its digits. So, the sum of digits being divisible by 3 implies N is divisible by 3, but for higher powers, we can't directly use the digit sum. Hmm.Wait, actually, for 9, the rule is similar: if the sum of digits is divisible by 9, then the number is divisible by 9. So, since 705 is not divisible by 9, N is not divisible by 9. So, the highest power is 3^1.But wait, hold on. Maybe I need to compute N modulo 9 or something else?Wait, actually, no. Because for 3^k, the rules for divisibility get more complicated beyond 3 and 9. For example, for 27, there isn't a straightforward digit sum rule. So, maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute N modulo 9 and modulo 27 to see if it's divisible by higher powers.But since N is a huge number, directly computing N modulo 9 or 27 is not feasible. However, I remember that for modulo 9, the value is equivalent to the sum of its digits modulo 9. Similarly, for modulo 3, it's the same.So, since the sum of digits is 705, which is 705 mod 9. Let me compute 705 divided by 9.9*78 = 702, so 705 - 702 = 3. So, 705 ≡ 3 mod 9. Therefore, N ≡ 3 mod 9, which is not 0, so N is not divisible by 9.Similarly, for 3^2=9, it's not divisible, so the highest power is 3^1. So, k=1.But wait, hold on. The options include up to more than 3, so maybe I need to check higher powers?Wait, but if N is not divisible by 9, then it can't be divisible by 27 or 81 either, right? Because if a number isn't divisible by 9, it can't be divisible by higher powers of 3.But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the digit sum rules apply beyond 9. Because for 27, the rule isn't just the sum of digits, but a more complicated process.Wait, actually, the standard divisibility rules for 3 and 9 are based on the fact that 10 ≡ 1 mod 3 and mod 9, so each digit contributes its face value times 1. But for higher powers, like 27, 10 is not congruent to 1 mod 27, so the digit sum method doesn't directly apply.Therefore, maybe I need another approach to check divisibility by 27 or higher.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute N modulo 27.But N is a huge number, so computing N modulo 27 directly is difficult. However, I can use the property that (a * 10 + b) mod 27 = ((a mod 27) * (10 mod 27) + (b mod 27)) mod 27.So, if I can compute N mod 27 by processing each digit, multiplying by 10 and adding the next digit, all modulo 27.But since N is formed by concatenating numbers from 19 to 92, each two-digit number, I can process each two-digit number as a separate entity.Wait, but each two-digit number is being concatenated, so effectively, N is equal to (...((19 * 100 + 20) * 100 + 21) * 100 + ... + 92).So, in terms of modulo 27, since 100 ≡ 100 mod 27. Let me compute 100 mod 27.27*3=81, 100-81=19, so 100 ≡ 19 mod 27.So, each time we multiply by 100, it's equivalent to multiplying by 19 mod 27.Therefore, the process is:Start with 0.For each number from 19 to 92:- Multiply current result by 19 (since 100 ≡19 mod27)- Add the current number- Take modulo 27So, let me try to compute this step by step.But since there are 74 numbers, this would take a while, but maybe we can find a pattern or compute it more efficiently.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total contribution of each two-digit number to N mod 27.Wait, another approach: Since N is the concatenation of numbers from 19 to 92, each two-digit number is effectively shifted left by 2 digits for each subsequent number. So, mathematically, N can be written as:N = 19 * 10^{146} + 20 * 10^{144} + 21 * 10^{142} + ... + 92 * 10^{0}But computing this modulo 27 is complicated because of the exponents. However, since 10^k mod 27 cycles every certain period, maybe we can find the cycle length.Compute 10^k mod 27:10^1 mod27=1010^2=100 mod27=1910^3=10*19=190 mod27: 27*7=189, so 190-189=110^3 ≡1 mod2710^4=10^1 *10^3≡10*1=10 mod2710^5=10^2 *10^3≡19*1=19 mod2710^6=10^3 *10^3≡1*1=1 mod27So, the cycle length is 3: 10,19,1,10,19,1,...So, every exponent k, 10^k mod27 cycles through 10,19,1,10,19,1,...So, for exponents:k=1:10k=2:19k=3:1k=4:10k=5:19k=6:1and so on.So, in N, each two-digit number is multiplied by 10^{2*(74 - position -1)}.Wait, maybe it's better to index the numbers from 0 to 73.Let me think: The first number is 19, which is multiplied by 10^{146}, which is 10^{2*(73)}.The second number is 20, multiplied by 10^{144}=10^{2*(72)}....The last number is 92, multiplied by 10^{0}=10^{2*0}.So, each number at position i (from 0 to73) is multiplied by 10^{2*(73 -i)}.So, 10^{2*(73 -i)} mod27.But since 10^3≡1 mod27, 10^{2*(73 -i)}= (10^3)^{something} *10^{remainder}.Wait, 2*(73 -i) divided by 3 gives a quotient and remainder.Let me compute 2*(73 -i) mod3.2*(73 -i) mod3= (2*73 -2i) mod3.73 mod3: 73/3=24*3=72, so 73≡1 mod3.So, 2*73≡2*1=2 mod3.Similarly, 2i mod3.So, overall, 2*(73 -i) mod3= (2 -2i) mod3.Which is equivalent to (2 -2i) mod3.So, depending on i, the exponent cycles through different residues.But maybe this is getting too complicated.Alternatively, since 10^3≡1 mod27, 10^{3k}≡1 mod27.So, 10^{2*(73 -i)}=10^{146 -2i}= (10^3)^{48} *10^{2}≡1^{48}*100≡19 mod27.Wait, 146 divided by3: 3*48=144, so 146=3*48 +2, so 10^{146}= (10^3)^{48}*10^2≡1^{48}*100≡19 mod27.Similarly, 10^{144}= (10^3)^{48}≡1 mod27.Wait, 10^{144}= (10^3)^{48}≡1^{48}=1 mod27.Wait, so 10^{146}=10^{144}*10^2≡1*19=19 mod27.Similarly, 10^{144}=1 mod27.Wait, let me see:For each number at position i (starting from 0), the exponent is 2*(73 -i).So, 2*(73 -i)=146 -2i.We can write 146 -2i=3*48 + (146 -2i -3*48)=3*48 + (146 -144 -2i)=3*48 + (2 -2i).So, 10^{146 -2i}= (10^3)^{48} *10^{2 -2i}≡1^{48}*10^{2 -2i}≡10^{2 -2i} mod27.But 10^{2 -2i} mod27.Wait, 2 -2i can be negative, but since exponents can be handled with mod φ(27)=18, but maybe it's better to compute 10^{2 -2i} mod27.But 10^{k} mod27 cycles every 3, as we saw earlier.So, 10^{k} mod27 cycles as 10,19,1,10,19,1,...So, for exponent k=2 -2i, we can compute k mod3.Compute (2 -2i) mod3.Which is (2 -2i) mod3.Which is equivalent to (2 + (-2i)) mod3.Which is (2 + (1i)) mod3, since -2≡1 mod3.So, (2 +i) mod3.Therefore, 10^{2 -2i} mod27=10^{(2 +i) mod3} mod27.So, depending on (2 +i) mod3, which can be 0,1,2.So, if (2 +i) mod3=0, then 10^{2 -2i}≡1 mod27.If (2 +i) mod3=1, then 10^{2 -2i}≡10 mod27.If (2 +i) mod3=2, then 10^{2 -2i}≡19 mod27.Therefore, for each i, we can compute (2 +i) mod3 and get the corresponding multiplier.So, now, N mod27 is equal to the sum over i=0 to73 of (number_i * multiplier_i) mod27.Where number_i is the two-digit number at position i (from 19 to92), and multiplier_i is 1,10, or19 depending on (2 +i) mod3.So, let me figure out how to compute this.First, let's note that i ranges from0 to73.For each i, compute (2 +i) mod3:If (2 +i) mod3=0: multiplier=1If (2 +i) mod3=1: multiplier=10If (2 +i) mod3=2: multiplier=19So, for each i, we can categorize the multiplier.But since i goes from0 to73, let's see how the multipliers cycle.Since (2 +i) mod3 cycles every 3 i's.So, starting at i=0:i=0: (2 +0)=2 mod3=2 → multiplier=19i=1: (2 +1)=3 mod3=0 → multiplier=1i=2: (2 +2)=4 mod3=1 → multiplier=10i=3: (2 +3)=5 mod3=2 → multiplier=19i=4: (2 +4)=6 mod3=0 → multiplier=1i=5: (2 +5)=7 mod3=1 → multiplier=10And so on.So, the multipliers cycle every 3 numbers: 19,1,10,19,1,10,...So, the sequence of multipliers is periodic with period3: 19,1,10,19,1,10,...Therefore, for each group of 3 consecutive i's, the multipliers are 19,1,10.So, let's compute the sum in groups of 3.Each group contributes:(number_i *19 + number_{i+1}*1 + number_{i+2}*10) mod27But since we have 74 numbers, which is not a multiple of3, we'll have 24 full groups (72 numbers) and 2 remaining numbers.So, first, let's compute the contributions from the first72 numbers, grouped into24 sets of3, each contributing (19a + b +10c) mod27, where a,b,c are consecutive numbers.Then, add the contributions from the last2 numbers.But this still seems complicated. Maybe instead, I can compute the total contribution by considering how many times each multiplier is used.Since the multipliers cycle every3, in74 numbers, how many times does each multiplier occur?Number of complete cycles:74 div3=24 cycles, with a remainder of2.In each cycle, each multiplier (19,1,10) occurs once.So, total counts:multiplier19:24 +1 (since the first number in the remainder is multiplier19)multiplier1:24multiplier10:24 +1 (since the second number in the remainder is multiplier10)Wait, let me see:Wait, starting from i=0, the multipliers are:i=0:19i=1:1i=2:10i=3:19i=4:1i=5:10...i=72:19i=73:1So, in total:From i=0 to73:Number of multiplier19: for i=0,3,6,...,72: total of25 times (since 72/3=24, plus1)Number of multiplier1: i=1,4,7,...,73: total of25 timesNumber of multiplier10: i=2,5,8,...,71: total of24 timesWait, because74=3*24 +2, so the last two multipliers are19 and1, not reaching the10.So, multiplier19 occurs25 times, multiplier1 occurs25 times, multiplier10 occurs24 times.Therefore, the total contribution is:sum_{i=0}^{73} (number_i * multiplier_i) ≡ (sum_{multiplier19} number_i *19 + sum_{multiplier1} number_i *1 + sum_{multiplier10} number_i *10) mod27So, let's denote:S19 = sum of numbers where multiplier is19S1 = sum of numbers where multiplier is1S10 = sum of numbers where multiplier is10Then, total contribution is (19*S19 +1*S1 +10*S10) mod27So, now, I need to compute S19, S1, S10.But how?Well, the numbers from19 to92 are in order, so the numbers assigned to each multiplier follow the cycle.Since the multipliers cycle every3 numbers, the numbers assigned to each multiplier are every third number starting from different points.Specifically:- S19 consists of numbers at positions i=0,3,6,...,72: total25 numbers.These are the numbers:19,22,25,...,92? Wait, no.Wait, starting from19, the first number is19, then the next number with multiplier19 is the fourth number, which is22, then the seventh number, which is25, etc.Wait, actually, the numbers are in order:19,20,21,22,23,24,...,92.So, the numbers assigned to multiplier19 are the 1st,4th,7th,... numbers.Similarly, multiplier1 is assigned to 2nd,5th,8th,... numbers.Multiplier10 is assigned to3rd,6th,9th,... numbers.So, let's list them:S19: numbers at positions0,3,6,...,72 (total25 numbers):Numbers:19,22,25,28,...,92.Similarly, S1: numbers at positions1,4,7,...,73 (total25 numbers):Numbers:20,23,26,...,91.S10: numbers at positions2,5,8,...,71 (total24 numbers):Numbers:21,24,27,...,90.So, now, I need to compute S19, S1, S10.Let me compute S19 first.S19: numbers starting at19, increasing by3 each time, up to92.Wait, 19,22,25,...,92.How many terms? Since it's25 numbers, starting at19, each step +3.So, the nth term is19 +3*(n-1).So, the last term is19 +3*(24)=19 +72=91. Wait, but we need to go up to92.Wait, hold on, 25th term:19 +3*(24)=91. But in our case, the last number assigned to S19 is at position72, which is the73rd number (since starting from0). Wait, the numbers go up to92, which is the74th number.Wait, let me check:Total numbers:74.Positions0-73.Numbers:Position0:19Position1:20Position2:21...Position73:92So, S19 includes position0,3,6,...,72: that's25 numbers.So, the numbers are:19 (pos0),22 (pos3),25 (pos6),28 (pos9),...Last number: position72:19 +3*(72/3)=19 +24=43? Wait, no.Wait, position72 is the73rd number, which is19 +72=91.Wait, no, each position corresponds to a number, so position0 is19, position1 is20,..., position73 is92.So, position72 is the73rd number:19 +72=91.Yes, so S19 includes numbers19,22,25,...,91.So, the sequence is19,22,25,...,91, which is an arithmetic sequence with first term19, common difference3, last term91.Number of terms: Let's compute n where19 +3*(n-1)=91.So, 3*(n-1)=72, so n-1=24, so n=25. Correct.So, S19 is the sum of this arithmetic sequence.Sum of arithmetic sequence: n*(a1 + an)/2=25*(19 +91)/2=25*(110)/2=25*55=1375.So, S19=1375.Similarly, S1: numbers at positions1,4,7,...,73:25 numbers.These numbers are20,23,26,...,92.First term20, last term92, common difference3.Number of terms:25.Sum:25*(20 +92)/2=25*(112)/2=25*56=1400.So, S1=1400.S10: numbers at positions2,5,8,...,71:24 numbers.These numbers are21,24,27,...,90.First term21, last term90, common difference3.Number of terms: Let's compute n where21 +3*(n-1)=90.3*(n-1)=69, so n-1=23, n=24. Correct.Sum:24*(21 +90)/2=24*(111)/2=24*55.5=1332.Wait, 24*55=1320, 24*0.5=12, so total1332.So, S10=1332.Therefore, now, total contribution is:19*S19 +1*S1 +10*S10 mod27Compute each term:19*S19=19*13751*S1=1*1400=140010*S10=10*1332=13320Compute each modulo27.First, compute19*1375 mod27.But 19 mod27=19.1375 mod27: Let's compute1375 divided by27.27*50=1350, 1375-1350=25, so1375≡25 mod27.So,19*25=475 mod27.Compute475 mod27:27*17=459, 475-459=16, so475≡16 mod27.So,19*S19≡16 mod27.Next,1*S1=1400 mod27.Compute1400 mod27:27*51=1377, 1400-1377=23, so1400≡23 mod27.So,1*S1≡23 mod27.Next,10*S10=13320 mod27.Compute13320 mod27:Divide13320 by27:27*500=13500, which is more than13320.27*490=13230, 13320-13230=90.90 mod27: 27*3=81, 90-81=9.So,13320≡9 mod27.So,10*S10≡9 mod27.Therefore, total contribution:16 +23 +9=48 mod27.48 mod27=48-27=21.So, N≡21 mod27.Therefore, N is not divisible by27, since21≠0 mod27.But wait, earlier we saw that N is divisible by3, since digit sum705≡3 mod9, which is not0, but705 is divisible by3.Wait, but when we computed N mod27, we got21, which is not0, so N is not divisible by27.But wait, if N is divisible by3, but not by9 or27, then the highest power is3^1.But hold on, the options include up to more than3, but according to our calculations, it's only divisible by3 once.But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with modulus, especially with concatenation, it's easy to make a mistake.Wait, so N mod27=21, which is not0, so N is not divisible by27.But just to be thorough, let me check if N is divisible by9.Earlier, we saw that the digit sum is705, which is705 mod9=3, so N≡3 mod9, which is not0, so N is not divisible by9.Therefore, N is divisible by3 but not by9 or higher powers, so k=1.But wait, the options are (A)0, (B)1, (C)2, (D)3, (E)more than3.So, the answer should be B)1.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in computing N mod27.Because when I computed N mod27, I considered each two-digit number multiplied by10^{something} mod27, but perhaps I messed up the exponents.Wait, let me try another approach.Alternatively, since N is the concatenation of numbers from19 to92, which is a long number, maybe I can compute N mod9 and N mod27 using the fact that concatenation is equivalent to multiplying by100 and adding the next number.But since 100≡1 mod9 and100≡19 mod27.So, for mod9:Each time, N = (current N *100 + next number) mod9.But since100≡1 mod9, this is equivalent to N = (current N *1 + next number) mod9.So, effectively, N mod9 is equal to the sum of all the two-digit numbers mod9.Similarly, for mod27, since100≡19 mod27, it's more complicated.But for mod9, it's easier.So, let's compute N mod9.N mod9 is equal to the sum of all the two-digit numbers from19 to92 mod9.So, sum of numbers from19 to92.Compute that sum.Number of terms:74.Sum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term)=74/2*(19 +92)=37*111=37*100 +37*11=3700 +407=4107.So, sum=4107.Now, compute4107 mod9.Sum of digits of4107:4+1+0+7=12, which is3 mod9.So,4107≡3 mod9.Therefore, N≡3 mod9, which confirms our earlier result.So, N is not divisible by9.Therefore, the highest power is3^1.So, the answer isB)1.But wait, the problem says \\"the highest power of3 that is a factor ofN\\". So, if N is divisible by3 but not by9, then k=1.Therefore, the answer isB)1.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Determine the coefficient of the x^2 term in the expansion of (x-2)^4.","answer":"To determine the coefficient of the ( x^2 ) term in the expansion of ( (x - 2)^4 ), I will use the binomial theorem.

The inequality I need to check is ( 2^{n+1} > n a_n + n + 2 ) for ( n geq n_0 ). I need to find the smallest positive integer ( n_0 ) where this inequality holds true. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, let me write down the inequality with the given ( a_n ). Since ( a_n = 2n - 1 ), substituting that into the inequality gives:( 2^{n+1} > n(2n - 1) + n + 2 )Let me simplify the right-hand side (RHS) first. Expanding ( n(2n - 1) ) gives ( 2n^2 - n ). Then adding ( n ) and 2, so:( 2n^2 - n + n + 2 = 2n^2 + 2 )So the inequality simplifies to:( 2^{n+1} > 2n^2 + 2 )Hmm, okay, so I need to find the smallest ( n_0 ) such that for all ( n geq n_0 ), ( 2^{n+1} > 2n^2 + 2 ). Maybe I can divide both sides by 2 to make it simpler:( 2^n > n^2 + 1 )So now the inequality is ( 2^n > n^2 + 1 ). That seems a bit more manageable. I remember that exponential functions like ( 2^n ) eventually grow faster than polynomial functions like ( n^2 ), so this inequality should hold for sufficiently large ( n ). But I need to find the exact smallest ( n_0 ).I think the best way to approach this is to test small positive integers ( n ) and see where the inequality starts to hold. Let me start plugging in values for ( n ):For ( n = 1 ):Left-hand side (LHS): ( 2^1 = 2 )RHS: ( 1^2 + 1 = 2 )So, ( 2 > 2 ) is false. They are equal.For ( n = 2 ):LHS: ( 2^2 = 4 )RHS: ( 2^2 + 1 = 5 )So, ( 4 > 5 ) is false.For ( n = 3 ):LHS: ( 2^3 = 8 )RHS: ( 3^2 + 1 = 10 )( 8 > 10 ) is false.For ( n = 4 ):LHS: ( 2^4 = 16 )RHS: ( 4^2 + 1 = 17 )( 16 > 17 ) is false.For ( n = 5 ):LHS: ( 2^5 = 32 )RHS: ( 5^2 + 1 = 26 )( 32 > 26 ) is true.Wait, so at ( n = 5 ), the inequality holds. But I should check ( n = 4 ) again because sometimes these things can flip between consecutive integers.Wait, at ( n = 4 ), LHS is 16, RHS is 17, so 16 is not greater than 17. So the inequality doesn't hold at ( n = 4 ). So, does it hold at ( n = 5 )? Yes, 32 > 26.But just to be thorough, let me check ( n = 6 ) as well:LHS: ( 2^6 = 64 )RHS: ( 6^2 + 1 = 37 )64 > 37, which is true.So, it seems that starting at ( n = 5 ), the inequality holds. But wait, let me check ( n = 0 ) just in case, although the problem says ( n in mathbb{N}^* ), which I think starts at 1.But just for completeness, ( n = 0 ):LHS: ( 2^0 = 1 )RHS: ( 0^2 + 1 = 1 )1 > 1 is false.So, the inequality first holds at ( n = 5 ). But before I conclude that ( n_0 = 5 ), I should also check if the inequality holds for all ( n geq 5 ). Maybe it's possible that it holds at ( n = 5 ) but fails again at some higher ( n ). But I don't think so because exponential growth should dominate.But just to be safe, let me test a few more values:For ( n = 6 ): 64 > 37, which is true.For ( n = 7 ): 128 > 50, true.For ( n = 8 ): 256 > 65, true.It seems to be consistently true from ( n = 5 ) onward. But just to make sure, maybe I can try to prove that for ( n geq 5 ), ( 2^n > n^2 + 1 ) holds.I can use mathematical induction for this. Let's try that.**Base Case:** ( n = 5 )We already checked that ( 2^5 = 32 > 25 + 1 = 26 ). So, the base case holds.**Inductive Step:** Assume that for some ( k geq 5 ), ( 2^k > k^2 + 1 ). We need to show that ( 2^{k+1} > (k+1)^2 + 1 ).Starting from the inductive hypothesis:( 2^k > k^2 + 1 )Multiply both sides by 2:( 2^{k+1} > 2(k^2 + 1) = 2k^2 + 2 )Now, we need to show that ( 2k^2 + 2 geq (k+1)^2 + 1 ). If this is true, then ( 2^{k+1} > 2k^2 + 2 geq (k+1)^2 + 1 ), which would complete the induction.Let's compute ( 2k^2 + 2 - [(k+1)^2 + 1] ):( 2k^2 + 2 - (k^2 + 2k + 1 + 1) = 2k^2 + 2 - k^2 - 2k - 2 = k^2 - 2k )So, ( 2k^2 + 2 - (k+1)^2 - 1 = k^2 - 2k )We need ( k^2 - 2k geq 0 ), which is equivalent to ( k(k - 2) geq 0 )Since ( k geq 5 ), ( k ) is positive and ( k - 2 geq 3 ), so ( k(k - 2) geq 0 ) is certainly true.Therefore, ( 2k^2 + 2 geq (k+1)^2 + 1 ) for ( k geq 5 ), which means:( 2^{k+1} > 2k^2 + 2 geq (k+1)^2 + 1 )Thus, by induction, the inequality ( 2^n > n^2 + 1 ) holds for all ( n geq 5 ).Therefore, the original inequality ( 2^{n+1} > n a_n + n + 2 ) simplifies to ( 2^n > n^2 + 1 ), which holds for all ( n geq 5 ). So the smallest positive integer ( n_0 ) is 5.But just to double-check, let me verify ( n = 5 ) in the original inequality:Original inequality: ( 2^{n+1} > n a_n + n + 2 )For ( n = 5 ):LHS: ( 2^{6} = 64 )RHS: ( 5 times (2 times 5 - 1) + 5 + 2 = 5 times 9 + 5 + 2 = 45 + 5 + 2 = 52 )So, 64 > 52, which is true.And for ( n = 4 ):LHS: ( 2^{5} = 32 )RHS: ( 4 times (2 times 4 - 1) + 4 + 2 = 4 times 7 + 4 + 2 = 28 + 4 + 2 = 34 )So, 32 > 34 is false.Therefore, ( n_0 = 5 ) is indeed the smallest positive integer where the inequality holds for all ( n geq n_0 ).**Final Answer**The smallest positive integer ( n_0 ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"Points A, B, and C have coordinates (5,5), (2,1), and (0, k), respectively. To minimize the sum of the distances AC + BC, the value of k is(A) 3,(B) 4 frac{1}{2},(C) 3 frac{6}{7},(D) 4 frac{5}{6},(E) 2 frac{1}{7}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are three points: A at (5,5), B at (2,1), and C at (0,k). I need to find the value of k that minimizes the sum of the distances AC + BC. The options are given, so maybe after figuring it out, I can match my answer with one of them.First, I remember that minimizing the sum of distances from a point to two fixed points is related to the reflection principle in geometry. It's like the shortest path problem where you reflect one point over a line and then find the straight line distance. So maybe I can use that here.Let me visualize this. Point A is at (5,5), which is somewhere in the first quadrant. Point B is at (2,1), which is closer to the origin. Point C is somewhere on the y-axis at (0,k). So, I need to find the point C on the y-axis such that the total distance from A to C and then from C to B is as small as possible.Hmm, so if I reflect one of the points over the y-axis, maybe I can find a straight line that intersects the y-axis at point C, which would give me the minimal sum of distances. Let me think about which point to reflect. If I reflect point B over the y-axis, it would be at (-2,1). Alternatively, reflecting point A over the y-axis would be (-5,5). But I think reflecting point B might make more sense because point C is on the y-axis, so reflecting B would help in finding the shortest path from A to C to B.Wait, actually, the reflection principle says that to minimize the path from A to C to B, where C is on a line (in this case, the y-axis), you can reflect one of the points across that line and then the minimal path is the straight line between the reflected point and the other original point, intersecting the line at point C.So, if I reflect point B across the y-axis, it becomes (-2,1). Then, the minimal path from A to C to B would be the same as the straight line distance from A to the reflection of B, which is (-2,1). The point where this straight line intersects the y-axis is the optimal point C.Alternatively, I could reflect point A over the y-axis to (-5,5) and then find the straight line from (-5,5) to B, which is (2,1), and see where that intersects the y-axis. Either way, it should give me the same point C.Let me try reflecting point B over the y-axis to (-2,1). Now, I need to find the equation of the line connecting A(5,5) and the reflection point (-2,1). Then, find where this line crosses the y-axis, which is at x=0. The y-coordinate there will be k.So, let's compute the slope of the line connecting (5,5) and (-2,1). The slope m is (1 - 5)/(-2 - 5) = (-4)/(-7) = 4/7.So, the slope is 4/7. Now, using point-slope form, let's write the equation of the line. Let's use point A(5,5):y - 5 = (4/7)(x - 5)Simplify this:y = (4/7)x - (4/7)*5 + 5Compute (4/7)*5: that's 20/7, which is approximately 2.857.So, y = (4/7)x - 20/7 + 5Convert 5 to sevenths: 5 = 35/7.So, y = (4/7)x - 20/7 + 35/7 = (4/7)x + 15/7.So, the equation of the line is y = (4/7)x + 15/7.Now, to find where this line crosses the y-axis, set x=0:y = (4/7)*0 + 15/7 = 15/7.15 divided by 7 is 2 and 1/7, which is approximately 2.142.Looking at the options, E is 2 1/7, which is exactly 15/7. So, is that the answer? Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might have mixed up the reflection.Alternatively, if I reflect point A over the y-axis to (-5,5) and then find the line from (-5,5) to B(2,1), would that give me the same point?Let me compute that. The slope between (-5,5) and (2,1) is (1 - 5)/(2 - (-5)) = (-4)/7 = -4/7.So, slope is -4/7. Using point (-5,5):y - 5 = (-4/7)(x + 5)Simplify:y = (-4/7)x - (20/7) + 5Convert 5 to sevenths: 35/7.So, y = (-4/7)x - 20/7 + 35/7 = (-4/7)x + 15/7.So, same equation as before. Therefore, when x=0, y=15/7, which is 2 1/7. So, that's consistent.Wait, but the options are A) 3, B) 4 1/2, C) 3 6/7, D) 4 5/6, E) 2 1/7.So, 15/7 is 2 1/7, which is option E. Hmm, but I thought maybe it's 3 6/7 or something else. Let me think again.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in reflecting the point. Let me double-check.If I reflect point B over the y-axis, it's (-2,1). Then, the line from A(5,5) to (-2,1) has slope (1-5)/(-2-5)= (-4)/(-7)=4/7, which is correct. Then, the equation is y = (4/7)x + 15/7, so when x=0, y=15/7≈2.142, which is 2 1/7.Alternatively, if I reflect point A over the y-axis, it's (-5,5). Then, the line from (-5,5) to B(2,1) has slope (1-5)/(2 - (-5))= (-4)/7= -4/7, which is correct. Then, the equation is y = (-4/7)x + 15/7, same as before. So, same result.Therefore, k=15/7=2 1/7, which is option E.But wait, the problem is asking for the sum of distances AC + BC. So, is this the minimal sum? Let me confirm.Yes, because by reflecting one point over the y-axis, the minimal path from A to C to B is equivalent to the straight line distance from A to the reflection of B, which intersects the y-axis at C. Therefore, this should give the minimal sum.Alternatively, I can think of it as an optimization problem. Let me set up the equations for AC and BC.Point C is (0,k). So, AC is the distance from (5,5) to (0,k):AC = sqrt[(5 - 0)^2 + (5 - k)^2] = sqrt[25 + (5 - k)^2]Similarly, BC is the distance from (2,1) to (0,k):BC = sqrt[(2 - 0)^2 + (1 - k)^2] = sqrt[4 + (1 - k)^2]So, the total distance is AC + BC = sqrt[25 + (5 - k)^2] + sqrt[4 + (1 - k)^2]To minimize this, I can take the derivative with respect to k and set it to zero.Let me denote f(k) = sqrt[25 + (5 - k)^2] + sqrt[4 + (1 - k)^2]Compute f'(k):f'(k) = [ ( -2(5 - k) ) / (2 sqrt[25 + (5 - k)^2]) ] + [ ( -2(1 - k) ) / (2 sqrt[4 + (1 - k)^2]) ]Simplify:f'(k) = [ (k - 5) / sqrt(25 + (5 - k)^2) ] + [ (k - 1) / sqrt(4 + (1 - k)^2) ]Set f'(k) = 0:(k - 5)/sqrt(25 + (5 - k)^2) + (k - 1)/sqrt(4 + (1 - k)^2) = 0Let me denote:Let’s set u = k - 5 and v = k - 1.But maybe it's better to write it as:(k - 5)/sqrt(25 + (5 - k)^2) = - (k - 1)/sqrt(4 + (1 - k)^2)Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:[(k - 5)^2] / [25 + (5 - k)^2] = [(k - 1)^2] / [4 + (1 - k)^2]Note that (5 - k)^2 = (k - 5)^2, and (1 - k)^2 = (k - 1)^2. So, the denominators are 25 + (k - 5)^2 and 4 + (k - 1)^2.So, the equation becomes:[(k - 5)^2] / [25 + (k - 5)^2] = [(k - 1)^2] / [4 + (k - 1)^2]Let me denote a = (k - 5)^2 and b = (k - 1)^2.Then, the equation is:a / (25 + a) = b / (4 + b)Cross-multiplying:a*(4 + b) = b*(25 + a)Expand both sides:4a + ab = 25b + abSubtract ab from both sides:4a = 25bSo, 4a = 25bBut a = (k - 5)^2 and b = (k - 1)^2.Therefore:4(k - 5)^2 = 25(k - 1)^2Expand both sides:4(k^2 - 10k + 25) = 25(k^2 - 2k + 1)Compute left side: 4k^2 - 40k + 100Compute right side: 25k^2 - 50k + 25Bring all terms to left side:4k^2 - 40k + 100 - 25k^2 + 50k -25 = 0Combine like terms:(4k^2 -25k^2) + (-40k +50k) + (100 -25) = 0Which is:-21k^2 +10k +75 = 0Multiply both sides by -1:21k^2 -10k -75 = 0Now, solve for k using quadratic formula:k = [10 ± sqrt(100 + 4*21*75)] / (2*21)Compute discriminant:100 + 4*21*75 = 100 + 6300 = 6400sqrt(6400) = 80So,k = [10 ±80]/42So, two solutions:k = (10 +80)/42 = 90/42 = 15/7 ≈2.142k = (10 -80)/42 = (-70)/42 = -5/3 ≈-1.666But since point C is at (0,k), and looking at the options, they are all positive, so k=15/7 is the valid solution.15/7 is 2 and 1/7, which is option E.Wait, but earlier I thought of reflecting and got the same answer. So, that confirms it.But just to make sure, let me plug k=15/7 into the original distance formula and see if it gives the minimal sum.Compute AC: sqrt[(5)^2 + (5 - 15/7)^2] = sqrt[25 + (20/7)^2] = sqrt[25 + 400/49] = sqrt[(1225 + 400)/49] = sqrt[1625/49] = (sqrt(1625))/7 ≈ (40.311)/7 ≈5.758Compute BC: sqrt[(2)^2 + (1 - 15/7)^2] = sqrt[4 + (-8/7)^2] = sqrt[4 + 64/49] = sqrt[(196 + 64)/49] = sqrt[260/49] = (sqrt(260))/7 ≈ (16.124)/7 ≈2.303Total sum ≈5.758 + 2.303 ≈8.061Now, let me try another k, say k=3, which is option A.Compute AC: sqrt[25 + (5 -3)^2] = sqrt[25 +4] = sqrt[29] ≈5.385Compute BC: sqrt[4 + (1 -3)^2] = sqrt[4 +4] = sqrt[8] ≈2.828Total sum≈5.385 +2.828≈8.213, which is higher than 8.061.Similarly, try k=4 1/2=9/2=4.5.Compute AC: sqrt[25 + (5 -4.5)^2] = sqrt[25 +0.25]=sqrt[25.25]≈5.025Compute BC: sqrt[4 + (1 -4.5)^2]=sqrt[4 +12.25]=sqrt[16.25]≈4.031Total≈5.025 +4.031≈9.056, which is even higher.Similarly, try k=3 6/7=27/7≈3.857.Compute AC: sqrt[25 + (5 -27/7)^2]=sqrt[25 + (8/7)^2]=sqrt[25 +64/49]=sqrt[(1225 +64)/49]=sqrt[1289/49]≈sqrt(26.306)≈5.13Compute BC: sqrt[4 + (1 -27/7)^2]=sqrt[4 + (-20/7)^2]=sqrt[4 +400/49]=sqrt[(196 +400)/49]=sqrt[596/49]≈sqrt(12.163)≈3.487Total≈5.13 +3.487≈8.617, which is still higher than 8.061.Similarly, try k=4 5/6≈4.833.Compute AC: sqrt[25 + (5 -4.833)^2]=sqrt[25 + (0.167)^2]≈sqrt[25.028]≈5.003Compute BC: sqrt[4 + (1 -4.833)^2]=sqrt[4 +14.694]≈sqrt[18.694]≈4.323Total≈5.003 +4.323≈9.326, which is higher.So, the minimal sum is indeed when k=15/7≈2.142, which is option E.Therefore, the answer is E) 2 1/7.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Evaluate lfloor0.999rfloor+lceil2.001rceil.","answer":"First, I need to evaluate the floor of 0.999.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.First, I remember that the volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. Since the volume is given, I can set up the equation to solve for r.So, let's write that down:(4/3)πr³ = 256π/3Hmm, okay, I can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by π to cancel it out:(4/3)r³ = 256/3Now, to get rid of the 4/3 on the left side, I can multiply both sides by 3/4:r³ = (256/3) * (3/4)The 3s cancel out, so we have:r³ = 256/4256 divided by 4 is 64, so:r³ = 64To find r, I take the cube root of both sides:r = ∛64Which is:r = 4Okay, so the radius of the sphere is 4 units.Now, the cube is inscribed in the sphere. I need to visualize this. An inscribed cube means that all eight vertices of the cube touch the inner surface of the sphere. So, the sphere is circumscribed around the cube.I remember that for a cube inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's space diagonal. That makes sense because the space diagonal would stretch from one vertex of the cube to the opposite vertex, passing through the center of the sphere.So, the space diagonal of the cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere. Since the radius is 4, the diameter is twice that, which is 8.Let me denote the edge length of the cube as 'a'. The space diagonal of a cube can be found using the formula:Space diagonal = a√3I remember this from the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. So, if the space diagonal is 8, then:a√3 = 8To solve for 'a', I divide both sides by √3:a = 8 / √3But, I think it's better to rationalize the denominator. So, multiplying numerator and denominator by √3:a = (8√3) / 3Okay, so the edge length of the cube is (8√3)/3.Now, the problem asks for the surface area of the cube. The surface area of a cube is calculated by the formula:Surface area = 6a²Since a cube has six faces, each with an area of a².So, let's compute a² first:a² = [(8√3)/3]²Let me calculate that step by step:First, square the numerator: (8√3)² = 8² * (√3)² = 64 * 3 = 192Then, square the denominator: 3² = 9So, a² = 192 / 9Simplify that fraction: 192 divided by 9. Let's see, 9*21=189, so 192-189=3, so it's 21 and 3/9, which simplifies to 21 and 1/3, or as an improper fraction, 64/3? Wait, wait, 192 divided by 9 is actually 64/3 because 192 divided by 3 is 64, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. So, 192/9 simplifies to 64/3.Wait, let me double-check that:(8√3)/3 squared is (64*3)/9, which is 192/9. 192 divided by 9 is 21.333..., which is 64/3 because 64 divided by 3 is approximately 21.333. So, yes, 192/9 simplifies to 64/3.So, a² = 64/3.Therefore, the surface area is 6*(64/3). Let's compute that:6*(64/3) = (6/1)*(64/3) = (6*64)/(1*3) = 384/3 = 128Wait, that seems straightforward. So, 6*(64/3) is 128.So, the surface area of the cube is 128.Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake.1. Volume of sphere: (4/3)πr³ = 256π/32. Solve for r: r³ = 64 => r = 43. Sphere diameter = 8, which is the space diagonal of the cube.4. Space diagonal of cube = a√3 = 8 => a = 8/√3 = (8√3)/35. Surface area of cube = 6a² = 6*(64*3)/9 = 6*(64/3) = 128Yes, that seems correct. I think I got it right.**Final Answer**The surface area of the inscribed cube is boxed{128}."},{"question":"Given the binomial expansion (( sqrt{x}+ frac{3}{ sqrt{x}})^{n}), the sum of all the binomial coefficients in the expansion is 64. Determine the coefficient of x in the expansion.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a binomial expansion: ((sqrt{x} + frac{3}{sqrt{x}})^n). The question says that the sum of all the binomial coefficients in the expansion is 64, and I need to determine the coefficient of (x) in the expansion. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the sum of all binomial coefficients in any binomial expansion ((a + b)^n) is found by setting (a = 1) and (b = 1). So, the sum would be ((1 + 1)^n = 2^n). In this problem, they mention the sum is 64, so I can set up the equation (2^n = 64). Let me solve for (n). Since (64) is (2^6), that means (n = 6). Okay, so the exponent (n) is 6. Got that down.Now, the next part is to find the coefficient of (x) in the expansion. So, I need to figure out which term in the expansion of ((sqrt{x} + frac{3}{sqrt{x}})^6) will result in a term with just (x), without any square roots or negative exponents.I recall that the general term in a binomial expansion ((a + b)^n) is given by the binomial formula: (binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}), where (k) ranges from 0 to (n). So, in this case, (a = sqrt{x}) and (b = frac{3}{sqrt{x}}), and (n = 6).Let me write out the general term for this expansion:[binom{6}{k} (sqrt{x})^{6 - k} left(frac{3}{sqrt{x}}right)^k]Simplify this term step by step. First, let's handle the exponents. The term ((sqrt{x})^{6 - k}) can be written as (x^{frac{6 - k}{2}}), because (sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}), so raising it to the power of (6 - k) gives (x^{frac{6 - k}{2}}).Similarly, (left(frac{3}{sqrt{x}}right)^k) can be written as (3^k times x^{-frac{k}{2}}), since (frac{1}{sqrt{x}} = x^{-1/2}), and raising it to the power of (k) gives (x^{-frac{k}{2}}).So, combining these, the general term becomes:[binom{6}{k} times x^{frac{6 - k}{2}} times 3^k times x^{-frac{k}{2}}]Now, let's combine the exponents of (x). The exponent from the first part is (frac{6 - k}{2}) and from the second part is (-frac{k}{2}). Adding these together:[frac{6 - k}{2} + left(-frac{k}{2}right) = frac{6 - k - k}{2} = frac{6 - 2k}{2} = 3 - k]So, the exponent of (x) in each term is (3 - k). We are looking for the term where the exponent of (x) is 1 because the question asks for the coefficient of (x). Therefore, we set up the equation:[3 - k = 1]Solving for (k), we subtract 3 from both sides:[- k = 1 - 3 - k = -2 k = 2]So, the term where (k = 2) will have the exponent of (x) equal to 1. Now, let's find the coefficient of that term.The coefficient is given by:[binom{6}{2} times 3^2]First, compute (binom{6}{2}). The combination formula is:[binom{6}{2} = frac{6!}{2!(6 - 2)!} = frac{6 times 5 times 4!}{2 times 1 times 4!} = frac{6 times 5}{2} = 15]So, (binom{6}{2} = 15).Next, compute (3^2 = 9).Multiply these together to get the coefficient:[15 times 9 = 135]Therefore, the coefficient of (x) in the expansion is 135.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 1. Sum of binomial coefficients: Set (x = 1), so ((sqrt{1} + 3/sqrt{1})^6 = (1 + 3)^6 = 4^6). Wait, hold on, that's not 64. Wait, hold on, this seems conflicting.Wait, hold on. The problem says the sum of all binomial coefficients is 64. But in my initial step, I thought that the sum is (2^n), which is 64, so (n = 6). But when I plug in (x = 1), the expansion becomes ((1 + 3)^6 = 4^6 = 4096), which is way larger than 64. So, that suggests that my initial assumption was wrong.Wait, so perhaps I misunderstood the question. It says the sum of all the binomial coefficients in the expansion is 64. Hmm.Wait, in the expansion of ((a + b)^n), the sum of the coefficients is found by setting (a = 1) and (b = 1). So, in this case, (a = sqrt{x}) and (b = 3/sqrt{x}). So, to find the sum of coefficients, we set (x = 1), so that (sqrt{x} = 1) and (1/sqrt{x} = 1). Therefore, the sum is ((1 + 3)^n = 4^n). Ah, so the sum of coefficients is (4^n), which is given as 64. So, (4^n = 64). Let's solve for (n).Since (4^3 = 64), because (4 times 4 times 4 = 64), so (n = 3). Wait, so earlier I thought (n = 6), but that was incorrect because I forgot that the coefficients are not just binomial coefficients, but each term is multiplied by 3 as well.So, actually, the sum of the coefficients is (4^n = 64), so (n = 3). That makes more sense because when I plug (x = 1), the expansion becomes ((1 + 3)^n = 4^n). So, 4^n = 64, so n = 3.Wait, so that changes everything. So, n is 3, not 6. So, my initial mistake was thinking that the sum of binomial coefficients is 2^n, but in reality, since each term is multiplied by 3, the sum is actually 4^n.So, that means n is 3.Okay, so now, with n = 3, let's find the coefficient of x in the expansion.So, the expansion is ((sqrt{x} + 3/sqrt{x})^3).Again, using the binomial theorem, the general term is:[binom{3}{k} (sqrt{x})^{3 - k} left(frac{3}{sqrt{x}}right)^k]Simplify the exponents:[(sqrt{x})^{3 - k} = x^{frac{3 - k}{2}}][left(frac{3}{sqrt{x}}right)^k = 3^k times x^{-frac{k}{2}}]So, combining these, the exponent of x is:[frac{3 - k}{2} - frac{k}{2} = frac{3 - k - k}{2} = frac{3 - 2k}{2}]We need the exponent to be 1, so set up the equation:[frac{3 - 2k}{2} = 1]Multiply both sides by 2:[3 - 2k = 2]Subtract 3 from both sides:[-2k = -1]Divide both sides by -2:[k = frac{1}{2}]Wait, that can't be right. (k) has to be an integer between 0 and 3 because it's the term number in the binomial expansion. So, getting (k = 1/2) doesn't make sense. Hmm, that suggests that there is no term with exponent 1 in the expansion when n = 3.But that contradicts the problem statement, which asks for the coefficient of x. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, let's double-check the sum of coefficients. The problem says the sum of all binomial coefficients is 64. So, if the expansion is ((sqrt{x} + 3/sqrt{x})^n), then the sum of coefficients is obtained by setting x = 1, which gives ((1 + 3)^n = 4^n). So, 4^n = 64, so n = 3, as 4^3 = 64.But if n = 3, then in the expansion, the exponents of x are:For each term, exponent is (frac{3 - 2k}{2}). So, for k = 0: exponent = 3/2k = 1: exponent = (3 - 2)/2 = 1/2k = 2: exponent = (3 - 4)/2 = -1/2k = 3: exponent = (3 - 6)/2 = -3/2So, none of these exponents are 1. So, that suggests that in the expansion with n = 3, there is no term with x^1. Therefore, the coefficient of x is 0.But the problem says to determine the coefficient of x. So, either the problem is wrong, or my reasoning is wrong.Wait, let's re-examine the problem statement: \\"the sum of all the binomial coefficients in the expansion is 64.\\" Hmm, so perhaps the question is referring to the sum of the binomial coefficients without considering the constants. That is, just the sum of (binom{n}{k}) for k from 0 to n, which is 2^n. So, 2^n = 64, which gives n = 6.But earlier, when I set x = 1, I get the sum of all coefficients as 4^n, which would be 4096 for n = 6. So, that's conflicting.Wait, perhaps the question is ambiguous. When it says \\"the sum of all the binomial coefficients,\\" does it mean the sum of the coefficients in front of each term, including the constants, or just the sum of the binomial coefficients (binom{n}{k}) without the constants?In the expansion, each term is (binom{n}{k} times (sqrt{x})^{n - k} times (3/sqrt{x})^k). So, the coefficient of each term is (binom{n}{k} times 3^k). So, the sum of all coefficients would be (sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} 3^k), which is equal to ((1 + 3)^n = 4^n). So, if the sum is 64, then 4^n = 64, so n = 3.But then, as I saw earlier, in the expansion with n = 3, there is no term with x^1, so the coefficient is 0. But the problem is asking to determine the coefficient of x, so maybe it's expecting a non-zero coefficient, which would mean that n is 6.Wait, let's see. Maybe the problem is referring to the sum of the binomial coefficients without the constants, meaning just (sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k}), which is 2^n. So, if 2^n = 64, then n = 6.But then, when we set x = 1, the sum of all coefficients is 4^n = 4096, which is not 64. So, that's conflicting.Wait, perhaps the question is not entirely clear. It says \\"the sum of all the binomial coefficients in the expansion is 64.\\" So, binomial coefficients are the (binom{n}{k}), so the sum is 2^n. So, 2^n = 64, n = 6.But then, when we compute the expansion, each term is (binom{6}{k} (sqrt{x})^{6 - k} (3/sqrt{x})^k), so the coefficient is (binom{6}{k} 3^k), and the exponent is ( (6 - k)/2 - k/2 = (6 - 2k)/2 = 3 - k). So, exponent is 3 - k.We need exponent = 1, so 3 - k = 1, so k = 2.Therefore, the coefficient is (binom{6}{2} 3^2 = 15 times 9 = 135).But wait, if n = 6, then the sum of all coefficients is 4^6 = 4096, not 64. So, that contradicts the given information.Alternatively, if n = 3, the sum of coefficients is 4^3 = 64, which matches the given information, but in that case, the exponent 1 is not present.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to clarify what is meant by \\"the sum of all the binomial coefficients in the expansion.\\" If it's just the sum of the coefficients (binom{n}{k}), then it's 2^n, which would be 64 when n = 6. But in that case, the sum of all coefficients in the expansion, considering the constants, is 4^n, which is 4096, which is different.Alternatively, if the problem is referring to the sum of the coefficients in the expansion, meaning all the numerical coefficients, then that would be 4^n = 64, so n = 3. But in that case, the coefficient of x is 0.Wait, perhaps the problem is written ambiguously. Maybe it's referring to the sum of the binomial coefficients, not considering the constants. So, if we consider the expansion as ((sqrt{x} + 3/sqrt{x})^n), the binomial coefficients are (binom{n}{k}), and their sum is 2^n = 64, so n = 6.But then, in that case, the sum of all coefficients in the expansion (including the constants) is 4^n = 4096, which is different. So, perhaps the problem is referring to the sum of the binomial coefficients, not the sum of all coefficients in the expansion.So, if that's the case, n = 6, and then the coefficient of x is 135.But then, the problem says \\"the sum of all the binomial coefficients in the expansion is 64.\\" So, binomial coefficients are (binom{n}{k}), so their sum is 2^n = 64, so n = 6.Therefore, the expansion is ((sqrt{x} + 3/sqrt{x})^6), and we need the coefficient of x.Earlier, I calculated that for n = 6, the exponent of x in the general term is 3 - k, so setting 3 - k = 1, k = 2.Then, the coefficient is (binom{6}{2} times 3^2 = 15 times 9 = 135).Therefore, the coefficient of x is 135.But wait, let me confirm this because earlier I thought that the sum of all coefficients is 4^n, which would be 4096, but if the problem is referring to the sum of binomial coefficients, which is 2^n, then n = 6.So, perhaps the problem is using \\"binomial coefficients\\" to refer to just the (binom{n}{k}), not the entire coefficient in the expansion.So, in that case, n = 6, and the coefficient of x is 135.Alternatively, if the problem is referring to the sum of all coefficients in the expansion, which is 4^n, then n = 3, but in that case, there is no x term.Therefore, the problem is ambiguous, but given that it says \\"the sum of all the binomial coefficients,\\" which are (binom{n}{k}), their sum is 2^n = 64, so n = 6.Therefore, the coefficient of x is 135.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The coefficient of (x) in the expansion is boxed{135}."},{"question":"A circle is inscribed in an equilateral triangle, and a square is inscribed in this circle.

I need to find the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the square. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.First, let me visualize the problem. There's an equilateral triangle, which means all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. Inside this triangle, there's a circle inscribed. An inscribed circle, or incircle, touches all three sides of the triangle. Then, inside this circle, there's a square inscribed. An inscribed square in a circle would have all four vertices touching the circumference of the circle.So, to find the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the square, I need to express both areas in terms of some common variable. Maybe I can express everything in terms of the radius of the circle, since that seems to be the common element between the triangle and the square.Let me denote the radius of the inscribed circle as r. Then, I can find the side length of the equilateral triangle in terms of r, and from there, compute its area. Similarly, I can find the side length of the square inscribed in the circle in terms of r, and compute its area. Then, take the ratio of these two areas.Starting with the equilateral triangle. I remember that for an equilateral triangle, the radius r of the inscribed circle (inradius) is related to the side length a by the formula:r = (a * sqrt(3)) / 6I think that's correct. Let me verify. In an equilateral triangle, the inradius is given by r = (a * sqrt(3)) / 6. Yes, that seems right because the height h of an equilateral triangle is (a * sqrt(3)) / 2, and the inradius is one-third of the height, so h / 3 = (a * sqrt(3)) / 6. So, that formula is correct.So, solving for a, the side length of the triangle:a = (6r) / sqrt(3) = 2r * sqrt(3)Simplify that, 6 divided by sqrt(3) is 2 sqrt(3). So, a = 2r sqrt(3). Okay, so the side length of the triangle is 2r sqrt(3).Now, the area of an equilateral triangle is given by (sqrt(3)/4) * a^2. Let me write that down:Area_triangle = (sqrt(3)/4) * a^2Substituting a = 2r sqrt(3):Area_triangle = (sqrt(3)/4) * (2r sqrt(3))^2Let me compute (2r sqrt(3))^2:(2r sqrt(3))^2 = (2r)^2 * (sqrt(3))^2 = 4r^2 * 3 = 12 r^2So, Area_triangle = (sqrt(3)/4) * 12 r^2 = (sqrt(3)/4) * 12 r^2 = 3 sqrt(3) r^2Okay, so the area of the triangle is 3 sqrt(3) r^2.Now, moving on to the square inscribed in the circle. The square is inscribed in the circle with radius r. So, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 2r.Let me denote the side length of the square as s. For a square, the diagonal d is related to the side length s by the formula d = s sqrt(2). So, since the diagonal is 2r, we have:s sqrt(2) = 2rSolving for s:s = (2r) / sqrt(2) = r sqrt(2)Simplify that, 2 divided by sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So, s = r sqrt(2).Now, the area of the square is s^2:Area_square = (r sqrt(2))^2 = r^2 * 2 = 2 r^2So, the area of the square is 2 r^2.Now, the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the square is:Ratio = Area_triangle / Area_square = (3 sqrt(3) r^2) / (2 r^2) = (3 sqrt(3)) / 2Simplify that, the r^2 terms cancel out. So, the ratio is (3 sqrt(3)) / 2, which can be written as 3 sqrt(3) : 2.Looking at the options, option C is 3 sqrt(3) : 2, so that should be the answer.Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. For the equilateral triangle, inradius r = (a sqrt(3))/6, so a = 2r sqrt(3). That seems correct.2. Area of triangle: (sqrt(3)/4) * a^2. Plugging in a, got 3 sqrt(3) r^2. That seems right.3. Square inscribed in circle: diagonal is 2r, so side s = 2r / sqrt(2) = r sqrt(2). Area is s^2 = 2 r^2. That looks correct.4. Ratio: (3 sqrt(3) r^2) / (2 r^2) = 3 sqrt(3)/2. So, 3 sqrt(3) : 2. That's option C.Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe I can think of another way to approach it, just to confirm.Alternatively, maybe assign a specific radius, compute the areas, and then find the ratio. Let's say r = 1. Then, the area of the triangle would be 3 sqrt(3) * 1^2 = 3 sqrt(3). The area of the square would be 2 * 1^2 = 2. So, the ratio is 3 sqrt(3) : 2, same as before. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, if I take r = something else, say r = 2. Then, area of triangle is 3 sqrt(3) * 4 = 12 sqrt(3). Area of square is 2 * 4 = 8. Ratio is 12 sqrt(3) / 8 = (3 sqrt(3))/2, same as before. So, the ratio is consistent regardless of r.Therefore, I think my answer is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Adams plans a profit of 10 % on the selling price of an article and his expenses are 15 % of sales.

I need to find the real number a. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the binomial expansion of (A + B)^n is the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) * A^(n-k) * B^k. So in this case, A is x and B is a/x², right? So each term in the expansion will be (9 choose k) * x^(9 - k) * (a/x²)^k.Let me write that out more clearly. The general term is:C(9, k) * x^(9 - k) * (a/x²)^kSimplify that term a bit. The (a/x²)^k part can be written as a^k * x^(-2k). So combining the x terms:x^(9 - k) * x^(-2k) = x^(9 - 3k)So each term is C(9, k) * a^k * x^(9 - 3k). Now, the problem says the constant term is 84. A constant term means the exponent of x is zero. So I need to find the value of k such that 9 - 3k = 0.Let me solve for k:9 - 3k = 03k = 9k = 3Okay, so the constant term occurs when k = 3. So the constant term is:C(9, 3) * a^3And that equals 84. So I can set up the equation:C(9, 3) * a^3 = 84I need to compute C(9, 3). I remember that C(n, k) is n! / (k! (n - k)! ). So plugging in n=9 and k=3:C(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * 6!) = (9 * 8 * 7 * 6! ) / (3! * 6!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = (504) / (6) = 84Oh, that's nice. So C(9, 3) is 84. So plugging back into the equation:84 * a^3 = 84Hmm, so 84 * a^3 = 84. To solve for a^3, I can divide both sides by 84:a^3 = 84 / 84 = 1So a^3 = 1. Therefore, a is the cube root of 1. Since we're dealing with real numbers, the real cube root of 1 is just 1.Wait, is that it? So a = 1?Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I used the binomial theorem correctly, identified the general term as C(9, k) * x^(9 - k) * (a/x²)^k.2. Simplified the exponents correctly: x^(9 - 3k).3. Set the exponent equal to zero for the constant term: 9 - 3k = 0, which gives k=3.4. Calculated C(9, 3) correctly as 84.5. Plugged into the equation: 84 * a^3 = 84, leading to a^3 = 1, so a=1.Seems solid. I don't see any mistakes here.

There's also a line passing through the origin, and it intersects these functions in the first quadrant at points A and B respectively. The condition given is that OB is three times OA, meaning the distance from the origin to B is three times the distance from the origin to A. I need to find the value of k.Hmm, let me visualize this. Both functions are hyperbolas in the first and third quadrants since they are inverse proportions. The line passing through the origin will intersect each hyperbola at some point in the first quadrant. Let me denote the line as y = mx, where m is the slope.So, point A is the intersection of y = mx and y₁ = 2/x. To find A, I can set mx = 2/x. Multiplying both sides by x gives mx² = 2, so x² = 2/m. Therefore, x = sqrt(2/m). Since we're in the first quadrant, x is positive. Then, y = mx = m * sqrt(2/m) = sqrt(2m). So, point A has coordinates (sqrt(2/m), sqrt(2m)).Similarly, point B is the intersection of y = mx and y₂ = k/x. Setting mx = k/x, multiplying both sides by x gives mx² = k, so x² = k/m. Thus, x = sqrt(k/m). Then, y = mx = m * sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(km). So, point B is (sqrt(k/m), sqrt(km)).Now, I need to find the distances OA and OB. Since both points are in the first quadrant, the distance from the origin can be found using the distance formula. For point A, OA = sqrt[(sqrt(2/m))² + (sqrt(2m))²] = sqrt[(2/m) + (2m)]. Similarly, OB = sqrt[(sqrt(k/m))² + (sqrt(km))²] = sqrt[(k/m) + (km)].Given that OB = 3OA, so sqrt[(k/m) + (km)] = 3 * sqrt[(2/m) + (2m)]. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:(k/m) + (km) = 9 * [(2/m) + (2m)].Simplify the right side: 9*(2/m + 2m) = 18/m + 18m.So, the equation becomes:(k/m) + (km) = 18/m + 18m.Let me rearrange terms:(k/m - 18/m) + (km - 18m) = 0.Factor out 1/m from the first pair and m from the second pair:(1/m)(k - 18) + m(k - 18) = 0.Factor out (k - 18):(k - 18)(1/m + m) = 0.So, either (k - 18) = 0 or (1/m + m) = 0.But 1/m + m = 0 implies m + 1/m = 0, which would mean m² + 1 = 0, leading to m² = -1. Since m is a real number (slope of a line), this is impossible. Therefore, the only solution is k - 18 = 0, so k = 18.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Found points A and B by solving the intersections correctly.2. Calculated OA and OB using the distance formula, which seems right.3. Set up the equation OB = 3OA, squared both sides correctly.4. Expanded both sides and rearranged, factoring out (k - 18) and (1/m + m). That seems correct.5. Since (1/m + m) can't be zero for real m, so k must be 18.Yes, that seems solid. So, k is 18.**Final Answer**The value of ( k ) is boxed{18}."},{"question":"Given the sets ( A = {(x, y) mid y^2 - x - 1 = 0} ), ( B = {(x, y) mid 4x^2 + 2x - 2y + 5 = 0} ), and ( C = {(x, y) mid y = kx + b} ), find all non-negative integers ( k ) and ( b ) such that ( (A cup B) cap C = emptyset ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find all non-negative integers ( k ) and ( b ) such that the intersection of ( (A cup B) ) and ( C ) is empty. The sets are defined as follows:- ( A = {(x, y) mid y^2 - x - 1 = 0} )- ( B = {(x, y) mid 4x^2 + 2x - 2y + 5 = 0} )- ( C = {(x, y) mid y = kx + b} )So, essentially, I need to find all lines ( y = kx + b ) with non-negative integer slopes ( k ) and y-intercepts ( b ) such that these lines don't intersect either set ( A ) or set ( B ). That means the line ( C ) should neither intersect the parabola ( A ) nor the curve ( B ).First, let me understand what sets ( A ) and ( B ) are.Set ( A ) is defined by the equation ( y^2 - x - 1 = 0 ). I can rewrite this as ( x = y^2 - 1 ). So, this is a parabola that opens to the right with vertex at ( (-1, 0) ).Set ( B ) is defined by ( 4x^2 + 2x - 2y + 5 = 0 ). Let me rearrange this equation to express ( y ) in terms of ( x ):( 4x^2 + 2x + 5 = 2y )Divide both sides by 2:( y = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} )So, set ( B ) is a parabola that opens upwards with vertex somewhere. Let me find the vertex. The standard form of a parabola is ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ), so the vertex is at ( x = -frac{b}{2a} ). Here, ( a = 2 ), ( b = 1 ), so vertex is at ( x = -frac{1}{4} ). Plugging back into the equation:( y = 2(-frac{1}{4})^2 + (-frac{1}{4}) + frac{5}{2} = 2(frac{1}{16}) - frac{1}{4} + frac{5}{2} = frac{1}{8} - frac{2}{8} + frac{20}{8} = frac{19}{8} )So, the vertex is at ( (-frac{1}{4}, frac{19}{8}) ). So, it's a parabola opening upwards, vertex at approximately (-0.25, 2.375).Now, set ( C ) is a straight line ( y = kx + b ). I need this line to not intersect either ( A ) or ( B ). So, the line should not intersect the right-opening parabola ( A ) and should not intersect the upward-opening parabola ( B ).So, I need to find all non-negative integers ( k ) and ( b ) such that the system of equations ( y = kx + b ) and ( x = y^2 - 1 ) has no solution, and also the system ( y = kx + b ) and ( y = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} ) has no solution.Let me tackle each system one by one.First, the intersection with set ( A ):Substitute ( y = kx + b ) into ( x = y^2 - 1 ):( x = (kx + b)^2 - 1 )Expanding the right-hand side:( x = k^2x^2 + 2kbx + b^2 - 1 )Bring all terms to one side:( k^2x^2 + (2kb - 1)x + (b^2 - 1) = 0 )This is a quadratic in ( x ). For the line not to intersect the parabola ( A ), this quadratic equation must have no real solutions. That means the discriminant must be negative.The discriminant ( D ) is:( D = (2kb - 1)^2 - 4 cdot k^2 cdot (b^2 - 1) )Let me compute this:( D = 4k^2b^2 - 4kb + 1 - 4k^2b^2 + 4k^2 )Simplify term by term:- ( 4k^2b^2 - 4k^2b^2 = 0 )- ( -4kb + 1 + 4k^2 )So, ( D = 4k^2 - 4kb + 1 )For no real solutions, ( D < 0 ):( 4k^2 - 4kb + 1 < 0 )Let me write this as:( 4k^2 - 4kb + 1 < 0 )Divide both sides by 4 (since 4 is positive, inequality remains the same):( k^2 - kb + frac{1}{4} < 0 )Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of ( k ) or ( b ). Let me see.Alternatively, maybe factor it or complete the square.Let me consider ( k^2 - kb + frac{1}{4} ). Let me treat this as a quadratic in ( k ):( k^2 - b k + frac{1}{4} < 0 )The discriminant of this quadratic in ( k ) is:( D' = b^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot frac{1}{4} = b^2 - 1 )So, for this quadratic in ( k ) to be negative, it must open upwards (since the coefficient of ( k^2 ) is positive) and have two real roots, meaning ( D' > 0 ), so ( b^2 - 1 > 0 implies b^2 > 1 implies b > 1 ) since ( b ) is non-negative integer.But wait, if ( D' > 0 ), then the quadratic in ( k ) has two real roots, and the quadratic is negative between these two roots. So, for ( k ) between the roots, the expression is negative.But since ( k ) is a non-negative integer, we can find the values of ( k ) that lie between the roots for each ( b ).But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can rewrite the expression:( k^2 - kb + frac{1}{4} = left(k - frac{b}{2}right)^2 - frac{b^2}{4} + frac{1}{4} = left(k - frac{b}{2}right)^2 + frac{1 - b^2}{4} )So, ( left(k - frac{b}{2}right)^2 + frac{1 - b^2}{4} < 0 )Since ( left(k - frac{b}{2}right)^2 ) is always non-negative, the entire expression is the sum of a non-negative term and ( frac{1 - b^2}{4} ). For this sum to be negative, ( frac{1 - b^2}{4} ) must be negative enough to make the entire expression negative.So, ( frac{1 - b^2}{4} < 0 implies 1 - b^2 < 0 implies b^2 > 1 implies b > 1 ) as before.So, only when ( b > 1 ), there is a possibility that the expression is negative. But even then, since ( left(k - frac{b}{2}right)^2 ) is non-negative, we need:( left(k - frac{b}{2}right)^2 < frac{b^2 - 1}{4} )Which implies:( |k - frac{b}{2}| < frac{sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} )Multiplying both sides by 2:( |2k - b| < sqrt{b^2 - 1} )This is a bit messy, but perhaps I can square both sides (since both sides are positive):( (2k - b)^2 < b^2 - 1 )Expanding the left side:( 4k^2 - 4kb + b^2 < b^2 - 1 )Simplify:( 4k^2 - 4kb < -1 )Which is:( 4k^2 - 4kb + 1 < 0 )Wait, that's the same inequality as before. Hmm, so it's a bit circular.Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of ( k ) and ( b ) being integers.Given that ( k ) and ( b ) are non-negative integers, and ( b > 1 ), let's try small integer values of ( b ) and see if there exists any integer ( k ) such that ( 4k^2 - 4kb + 1 < 0 ).Let me try ( b = 2 ):Then, the inequality becomes:( 4k^2 - 8k + 1 < 0 )Let me solve ( 4k^2 - 8k + 1 = 0 ):Discriminant ( D = 64 - 16 = 48 )Roots: ( k = frac{8 pm sqrt{48}}{8} = frac{8 pm 4sqrt{3}}{8} = frac{2 pm sqrt{3}}{2} approx frac{2 pm 1.732}{2} )So, approximately, ( k approx frac{2 + 1.732}{2} approx 1.866 ) and ( k approx frac{2 - 1.732}{2} approx 0.134 )So, the inequality ( 4k^2 - 8k + 1 < 0 ) holds for ( 0.134 < k < 1.866 ). Since ( k ) is a non-negative integer, the only possible integer in this interval is ( k = 1 ).So, for ( b = 2 ), ( k = 1 ) satisfies the inequality. Therefore, the line ( y = x + 2 ) does not intersect set ( A ).Wait, but I need the line not to intersect either ( A ) or ( B ). So, even if it doesn't intersect ( A ), it might still intersect ( B ). So, I need to check both conditions.Similarly, let's try ( b = 3 ):Inequality becomes ( 4k^2 - 12k + 1 < 0 )Solving ( 4k^2 - 12k + 1 = 0 ):Discriminant ( D = 144 - 16 = 128 )Roots: ( k = frac{12 pm sqrt{128}}{8} = frac{12 pm 8sqrt{2}}{8} = frac{3 pm 2sqrt{2}}{2} approx frac{3 pm 2.828}{2} )Approximately, ( k approx frac{3 + 2.828}{2} approx 2.914 ) and ( k approx frac{3 - 2.828}{2} approx 0.086 )So, the inequality holds for ( 0.086 < k < 2.914 ). Since ( k ) is integer, possible ( k = 1, 2 ).So, for ( b = 3 ), ( k = 1 ) and ( k = 2 ) satisfy the inequality.Similarly, ( b = 4 ):Inequality: ( 4k^2 - 16k + 1 < 0 )Solving ( 4k^2 - 16k + 1 = 0 ):Discriminant ( D = 256 - 16 = 240 )Roots: ( k = frac{16 pm sqrt{240}}{8} = frac{16 pm 4sqrt{15}}{8} = frac{4 pm sqrt{15}}{2} approx frac{4 pm 3.872}{2} )Approximately, ( k approx frac{4 + 3.872}{2} approx 3.936 ) and ( k approx frac{4 - 3.872}{2} approx 0.064 )So, inequality holds for ( 0.064 < k < 3.936 ). Integer ( k = 1, 2, 3 ).So, for ( b = 4 ), ( k = 1, 2, 3 ) satisfy the inequality.Wait, but as ( b ) increases, the range of ( k ) that satisfies the inequality also increases. But since ( k ) is a non-negative integer, we might have an infinite number of solutions unless we bound ( b ).But since ( k ) and ( b ) are non-negative integers, perhaps we can find a maximum ( b ) beyond which the inequality cannot hold for any ( k ).Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between ( k ) and ( b ) such that ( 4k^2 - 4kb + 1 < 0 ).Let me rearrange the inequality:( 4k^2 - 4kb + 1 < 0 )Divide both sides by 4:( k^2 - kb + frac{1}{4} < 0 )This can be rewritten as:( (k - frac{b}{2})^2 < frac{b^2 - 1}{4} )Which implies:( |k - frac{b}{2}| < frac{sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} )So,( -frac{sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} < k - frac{b}{2} < frac{sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} )Adding ( frac{b}{2} ) to all sides:( frac{b}{2} - frac{sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} < k < frac{b}{2} + frac{sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} )Simplify:( frac{b - sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} < k < frac{b + sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} )Since ( k ) is an integer, we can look for integer values of ( k ) in this interval.Let me compute ( frac{b - sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} ) and ( frac{b + sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} ) for integer ( b geq 2 ).Let me compute for ( b = 2 ):Lower bound: ( frac{2 - sqrt{4 - 1}}{2} = frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{2} approx frac{2 - 1.732}{2} approx 0.134 )Upper bound: ( frac{2 + sqrt{3}}{2} approx frac{2 + 1.732}{2} approx 1.866 )So, ( k ) must be between approximately 0.134 and 1.866, so ( k = 1 ).Similarly, for ( b = 3 ):Lower bound: ( frac{3 - sqrt{9 - 1}}{2} = frac{3 - 2sqrt{2}}{2} approx frac{3 - 2.828}{2} approx 0.086 )Upper bound: ( frac{3 + 2sqrt{2}}{2} approx frac{3 + 2.828}{2} approx 2.914 )So, ( k = 1, 2 ).For ( b = 4 ):Lower bound: ( frac{4 - sqrt{16 - 1}}{2} = frac{4 - sqrt{15}}{2} approx frac{4 - 3.872}{2} approx 0.064 )Upper bound: ( frac{4 + sqrt{15}}{2} approx frac{4 + 3.872}{2} approx 3.936 )So, ( k = 1, 2, 3 ).For ( b = 5 ):Lower bound: ( frac{5 - sqrt{25 - 1}}{2} = frac{5 - sqrt{24}}{2} approx frac{5 - 4.899}{2} approx 0.0505 )Upper bound: ( frac{5 + sqrt{24}}{2} approx frac{5 + 4.899}{2} approx 4.9495 )So, ( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 ).Wait, I see a pattern here. For each ( b geq 2 ), the lower bound is approaching 0 as ( b ) increases, and the upper bound is approaching ( b ). So, the integer ( k ) can take values from 1 up to ( lfloor frac{b + sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} rfloor ).But since ( frac{b + sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{2} ) is less than ( b ) for all ( b > 1 ), the maximum ( k ) is less than ( b ).Wait, let me check for ( b = 10 ):Lower bound: ( frac{10 - sqrt{100 - 1}}{2} = frac{10 - sqrt{99}}{2} approx frac{10 - 9.9499}{2} approx 0.025 )Upper bound: ( frac{10 + sqrt{99}}{2} approx frac{10 + 9.9499}{2} approx 9.9749 )So, ( k = 1, 2, ..., 9 ).So, as ( b ) increases, the number of possible ( k ) increases as well. However, since ( k ) and ( b ) are non-negative integers, in theory, there are infinitely many pairs ( (k, b) ) that satisfy the inequality for set ( A ). But we also have to consider the condition for set ( B ).So, even if a line doesn't intersect ( A ), it might still intersect ( B ). Therefore, we need to ensure that the line ( y = kx + b ) does not intersect either ( A ) or ( B ).So, let's now consider the intersection with set ( B ):Set ( B ) is ( y = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} ). So, substituting ( y = kx + b ) into this equation:( kx + b = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} )Bring all terms to one side:( 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} - kx - b = 0 )Simplify:( 2x^2 + (1 - k)x + left( frac{5}{2} - b right) = 0 )Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:( 4x^2 + 2(1 - k)x + (5 - 2b) = 0 )So, the quadratic equation is:( 4x^2 + 2(1 - k)x + (5 - 2b) = 0 )For the line not to intersect set ( B ), this quadratic must have no real solutions. So, the discriminant must be negative.Compute the discriminant ( D'' ):( D'' = [2(1 - k)]^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot (5 - 2b) )Simplify:( D'' = 4(1 - 2k + k^2) - 16(5 - 2b) )Expand:( D'' = 4 - 8k + 4k^2 - 80 + 32b )Combine like terms:( D'' = 4k^2 - 8k + 32b - 76 )For no real solutions, ( D'' < 0 ):( 4k^2 - 8k + 32b - 76 < 0 )Let me simplify this inequality:Divide all terms by 4:( k^2 - 2k + 8b - 19 < 0 )So, ( k^2 - 2k + 8b - 19 < 0 )This is another quadratic inequality, but this time in terms of ( k ) and ( b ). Let me rearrange it:( 8b < -k^2 + 2k + 19 )So,( b < frac{-k^2 + 2k + 19}{8} )Since ( b ) is a non-negative integer, this gives an upper bound on ( b ) for each ( k ).So, for each ( k ), ( b ) must be less than ( frac{-k^2 + 2k + 19}{8} ).Let me compute ( frac{-k^2 + 2k + 19}{8} ) for non-negative integers ( k ):Start with ( k = 0 ):( frac{-0 + 0 + 19}{8} = frac{19}{8} approx 2.375 ). So, ( b < 2.375 ), so ( b leq 2 ).( k = 1 ):( frac{-1 + 2 + 19}{8} = frac{20}{8} = 2.5 ). So, ( b < 2.5 ), ( b leq 2 ).( k = 2 ):( frac{-4 + 4 + 19}{8} = frac{19}{8} approx 2.375 ). So, ( b leq 2 ).( k = 3 ):( frac{-9 + 6 + 19}{8} = frac{16}{8} = 2 ). So, ( b < 2 ), ( b leq 1 ).( k = 4 ):( frac{-16 + 8 + 19}{8} = frac{11}{8} approx 1.375 ). So, ( b leq 1 ).( k = 5 ):( frac{-25 + 10 + 19}{8} = frac{4}{8} = 0.5 ). So, ( b < 0.5 ), but ( b ) is non-negative integer, so ( b = 0 ).( k = 6 ):( frac{-36 + 12 + 19}{8} = frac{-5}{8} approx -0.625 ). Since ( b ) must be non-negative, no solution here.Similarly, for ( k geq 6 ), the expression ( frac{-k^2 + 2k + 19}{8} ) becomes negative, so no solutions.So, summarizing:- For ( k = 0 ): ( b leq 2 )- For ( k = 1 ): ( b leq 2 )- For ( k = 2 ): ( b leq 2 )- For ( k = 3 ): ( b leq 1 )- For ( k = 4 ): ( b leq 1 )- For ( k = 5 ): ( b = 0 )- For ( k geq 6 ): No solutionsSo, now, combining this with the earlier condition for set ( A ), which required ( 4k^2 - 4kb + 1 < 0 ), we need to find pairs ( (k, b) ) that satisfy both inequalities.Let me list the possible ( (k, b) ) pairs based on the above:1. ( k = 0 ): ( b leq 2 )   - Check if ( 4(0)^2 - 4(0)b + 1 < 0 implies 1 < 0 ), which is false. So, no solutions here.2. ( k = 1 ): ( b leq 2 )   - For ( b = 0 ): Check ( 4(1)^2 - 4(1)(0) + 1 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 < 0 )? No.   - For ( b = 1 ): ( 4 - 4 + 1 = 1 < 0 )? No.   - For ( b = 2 ): ( 4 - 8 + 1 = -3 < 0 ). Yes. So, ( (1, 2) ) is a candidate.3. ( k = 2 ): ( b leq 2 )   - For ( b = 0 ): ( 16 - 0 + 1 = 17 < 0 )? No.   - For ( b = 1 ): ( 16 - 8 + 1 = 9 < 0 )? No.   - For ( b = 2 ): ( 16 - 16 + 1 = 1 < 0 )? No.   - So, no solutions for ( k = 2 ).4. ( k = 3 ): ( b leq 1 )   - For ( b = 0 ): ( 36 - 0 + 1 = 37 < 0 )? No.   - For ( b = 1 ): ( 36 - 12 + 1 = 25 < 0 )? No.   - So, no solutions for ( k = 3 ).5. ( k = 4 ): ( b leq 1 )   - For ( b = 0 ): ( 64 - 0 + 1 = 65 < 0 )? No.   - For ( b = 1 ): ( 64 - 16 + 1 = 49 < 0 )? No.   - So, no solutions for ( k = 4 ).6. ( k = 5 ): ( b = 0 )   - Check ( 4(25) - 4(5)(0) + 1 = 100 + 0 + 1 = 101 < 0 )? No.   - So, no solution.So, the only candidate from the above is ( (k, b) = (1, 2) ).But wait, let's verify this. For ( k = 1 ) and ( b = 2 ), we need to ensure that the line ( y = x + 2 ) does not intersect either ( A ) or ( B ).First, check intersection with ( A ):We already saw that substituting ( y = x + 2 ) into ( x = y^2 - 1 ) gives a quadratic with discriminant ( D = 4(1)^2 - 4(1)(2) + 1 = 4 - 8 + 1 = -3 < 0 ). So, no intersection with ( A ).Now, check intersection with ( B ):Substitute ( y = x + 2 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} ):( x + 2 = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} )Simplify:( 2 = 2x^2 + frac{5}{2} )Multiply both sides by 2:( 4 = 4x^2 + 5 )So,( 4x^2 = -1 )Which has no real solutions. So, indeed, the line ( y = x + 2 ) does not intersect ( B ) either.Therefore, ( (k, b) = (1, 2) ) is a valid solution.But wait, earlier when considering set ( A ), for ( b = 2 ), ( k = 1 ) was the only solution, and for higher ( b ), more ( k ) values were possible, but when considering set ( B ), those higher ( b ) values might not satisfy the discriminant condition.Wait, let me check for ( b = 2 ) and ( k = 1 ), which works. What about ( b = 3 ) and ( k = 1 ) or ( k = 2 )?For ( b = 3 ), ( k = 1 ):Check intersection with ( B ):Substitute ( y = x + 3 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} ):( x + 3 = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} )Simplify:( 3 = 2x^2 + frac{5}{2} )Multiply by 2:( 6 = 4x^2 + 5 implies 4x^2 = 1 implies x^2 = frac{1}{4} implies x = pm frac{1}{2} )So, real solutions exist, meaning the line intersects ( B ). Therefore, ( (k, b) = (1, 3) ) is invalid.Similarly, for ( b = 3 ), ( k = 2 ):Substitute ( y = 2x + 3 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} ):( 2x + 3 = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} )Simplify:( 2x + 3 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 )Bring all terms to one side:( 2x^2 - x - 0.5 = 0 )Multiply by 2:( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 )Discriminant ( D'' = 4 + 16 = 20 > 0 ), so real solutions exist. Therefore, ( (2, 3) ) is invalid.Similarly, for ( b = 4 ), ( k = 1, 2, 3 ):Take ( k = 1 ), ( b = 4 ):Substitute ( y = x + 4 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + frac{5}{2} ):( x + 4 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 )Simplify:( 4 = 2x^2 + 2.5 implies 2x^2 = 1.5 implies x^2 = 0.75 implies x = pm sqrt{0.75} )Real solutions exist, so invalid.For ( k = 2 ), ( b = 4 ):Substitute ( y = 2x + 4 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 ):( 2x + 4 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 )Simplify:( 2x + 4 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 implies 2x^2 - x - 1.5 = 0 )Multiply by 2:( 4x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 )Discriminant ( D'' = 4 + 48 = 52 > 0 ), real solutions. Invalid.For ( k = 3 ), ( b = 4 ):Substitute ( y = 3x + 4 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 ):( 3x + 4 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 )Simplify:( 2x^2 - 2x - 1.5 = 0 )Multiply by 2:( 4x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0 )Discriminant ( D'' = 16 + 48 = 64 > 0 ), real solutions. Invalid.So, all these pairs intersect ( B ), so they are invalid.Similarly, for ( b = 5 ), ( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 ):Take ( k = 1 ), ( b = 5 ):Substitute ( y = x + 5 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 ):( x + 5 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 implies 5 = 2x^2 + 2.5 implies 2x^2 = 2.5 implies x^2 = 1.25 implies x = pm sqrt{1.25} ). Real solutions. Invalid.For ( k = 2 ), ( b = 5 ):Substitute ( y = 2x + 5 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 ):( 2x + 5 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 implies 2x^2 - x - 2.5 = 0 )Multiply by 2:( 4x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0 )Discriminant ( D'' = 4 + 80 = 84 > 0 ). Real solutions. Invalid.Similarly, ( k = 3 ), ( b = 5 ):Substitute ( y = 3x + 5 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 ):( 3x + 5 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 implies 2x^2 - 2x - 2.5 = 0 )Multiply by 2:( 4x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0 )Discriminant ( D'' = 16 + 80 = 96 > 0 ). Real solutions. Invalid.For ( k = 4 ), ( b = 5 ):Substitute ( y = 4x + 5 ) into ( y = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 ):( 4x + 5 = 2x^2 + x + 2.5 implies 2x^2 - 3x - 2.5 = 0 )Multiply by 2:( 4x^2 - 6x - 5 = 0 )Discriminant ( D'' = 36 + 80 = 116 > 0 ). Real solutions. Invalid.So, all these pairs intersect ( B ), hence invalid.Similarly, for higher ( b ), the lines will intersect ( B ) because the parabola ( B ) is opening upwards and the lines with positive slopes will eventually intersect it.Therefore, the only pair that satisfies both conditions is ( (k, b) = (1, 2) ).But wait, let me check ( k = 0 ). For ( k = 0 ), ( b leq 2 ). Let's see:For ( k = 0 ), ( b = 0 ):Check intersection with ( A ):Substitute ( y = 0x + 0 = 0 ) into ( x = y^2 - 1 implies x = -1 ). So, point ( (-1, 0) ) is on both ( A ) and ( C ). So, intersection exists. Invalid.For ( k = 0 ), ( b = 1 ):Substitute ( y = 1 ) into ( x = y^2 - 1 implies x = 0 ). So, point ( (0, 1) ) is on both ( A ) and ( C ). Intersection exists. Invalid.For ( k = 0 ), ( b = 2 ):Substitute ( y = 2 ) into ( x = y^2 - 1 implies x = 4 - 1 = 3 ). So, point ( (3, 2) ) is on both ( A ) and ( C ). Intersection exists. Invalid.So, indeed, ( k = 0 ) with any ( b leq 2 ) intersects ( A ).Therefore, the only valid pair is ( (1, 2) ).Wait, but earlier when considering set ( A ), for ( b = 2 ), ( k = 1 ) was the only solution, and for higher ( b ), more ( k ) values were possible, but when considering set ( B ), those higher ( b ) values might not satisfy the discriminant condition.But as we saw, for ( b geq 3 ), even if the line doesn't intersect ( A ), it does intersect ( B ). So, the only pair that doesn't intersect either is ( (1, 2) ).Therefore, the only non-negative integers ( k ) and ( b ) such that ( (A cup B) cap C = emptyset ) is ( k = 1 ) and ( b = 2 ).**Final Answer**The only solution is (boxed{k = 1}) and (boxed{b = 2}). However, since the problem asks for all non-negative integers (k) and (b), and they should be presented together, the final answer is (boxed{(1, 2)}).But looking back, the instructions say to put the final answer within boxed{}, and usually, for multiple values, we can list them as pairs. So, the final answer is (boxed{(1, 2)}).**Final Answer**boxed{(1, 2)}"},{"question":"In the 100-digit number 12345678901234...7890, all digits in odd positions were crossed out; in the resulting 50-digit number, all digits in odd positions were crossed out again, and so on. The crossing out continued as long as there were digits to cross out. Which digit was crossed out last?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about a 100-digit number that goes 12345678901234...7890. The process is that all digits in odd positions are crossed out, then in the resulting 50-digit number, the same thing happens: crossing out digits in odd positions again, and this continues until there are no digits left to cross out. The question is asking which digit was crossed out last.Hmm, let me try to visualize this. The original number is 100 digits long, right? So it's like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,... all the way up to 100 digits. So the first digit is 1, the second is 2, third is 3, and so on until the 100th digit, which is 0.Now, the first step is crossing out all digits in odd positions. So, positions 1,3,5,...,99 are crossed out. That leaves us with the digits in even positions: 2,4,6,8,0,2,4,6,8,0,... up to 50 digits. So after the first crossing out, we have a 50-digit number.Then, in the next step, we cross out all digits in odd positions again. So, positions 1,3,5,...,49 of this 50-digit number are crossed out. That leaves us with 25 digits. Wait, 50 divided by 2 is 25, so now we have a 25-digit number.Wait, but 25 is odd, so when we cross out the odd positions again, we'll be left with 12 digits? Because 25 divided by 2 is 12.5, but since we can't have half digits, it's 12 digits. Hmm, actually, wait: when you cross out every other digit starting from the first, the number of digits left is the floor of (n+1)/2. So for 25 digits, it's (25+1)/2 = 13. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think.If you have an odd number of digits, say 25, and you cross out the odd positions, which are 1,3,5,...,25. So how many digits are crossed out? 13 digits, because (25 + 1)/2 = 13. So the remaining digits are 25 - 13 = 12. So yes, 12 digits left.Wait, but actually, when you cross out the odd positions, you're removing every other digit starting from the first. So for 25 digits, the number of digits remaining is 12, because 25 divided by 2 is 12.5, and you take the floor. So yeah, 12 digits.So now, we have a 12-digit number. Then, we cross out the odd positions again, so positions 1,3,5,7,9,11. That leaves us with 6 digits.Then, cross out odd positions again, leaving 3 digits.Cross out odd positions again, leaving 1 digit.So, the last digit crossed out is the one that was in the position that was the last to be crossed out in each step.Wait, but actually, the process is that in each step, you cross out the digits in the odd positions, so the digits that remain are the even positions of the previous step.So, the last digit remaining is the one that was in the last position of the previous step.But the question is asking which digit was crossed out last. So, not the last remaining digit, but the last digit that was crossed out during the entire process.Hmm, so perhaps the last digit to be crossed out is the one that was in the second position of the last step before only one digit remains.Wait, let me think step by step.Let me try to model this.Original number: 100 digits.Step 1: Cross out odd positions, leaving 50 digits.Step 2: Cross out odd positions, leaving 25 digits.Step 3: Cross out odd positions, leaving 12 digits.Step 4: Cross out odd positions, leaving 6 digits.Step 5: Cross out odd positions, leaving 3 digits.Step 6: Cross out odd positions, leaving 1 digit.So, the process stops when only one digit remains, which is the last digit not crossed out. But the question is about the last digit that was crossed out, not the last remaining digit.So, in each step, we cross out some digits, and the last digit crossed out would be the last one in the current step.So, in step 1, we cross out digits 1,3,5,...,99. So the last digit crossed out in step 1 is 99th digit, which is 0 (since the 100th digit is 0, so 99th is 9? Wait, let me check.Wait, the original number is 12345678901234567890... up to 100 digits.So, the digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,... So, every 10 digits, it cycles through 1-0.So, the 99th digit: Let's see, 99 divided by 10 is 9 with remainder 9, so the 99th digit is the 9th digit in the cycle, which is 9.Similarly, the 100th digit is 0.So, in step 1, crossing out positions 1,3,5,...,99. So the last digit crossed out is 99th digit, which is 9.Then, step 2: we have a 50-digit number, which is the even positions of the original number. So, positions 2,4,6,...,100.So, the 50-digit number is 2,4,6,8,0,2,4,6,8,0,... up to 50 digits.Then, crossing out the odd positions again: positions 1,3,5,...,49. So, the last digit crossed out in step 2 is the 49th digit of this 50-digit number.What is the 49th digit in this 50-digit number?Well, the 50-digit number is 2,4,6,8,0,2,4,6,8,0,... repeating every 5 digits: 2,4,6,8,0.So, 50 digits is 10 cycles of 5 digits each.So, the 49th digit: 49 divided by 5 is 9 with remainder 4. So, the 4th digit in the cycle is 8.So, the last digit crossed out in step 2 is 8.Step 3: Now, we have a 25-digit number, which is the even positions of the 50-digit number.So, the 50-digit number is positions 2,4,6,...,100 of the original number.So, the 25-digit number is positions 4,8,12,...,100 of the original number.Wait, no: in step 2, we crossed out the odd positions of the 50-digit number, which corresponded to positions 2,6,10,...,98 of the original number.Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think differently.Each step, the remaining digits are the even positions of the previous step.So, step 1: remaining digits are positions 2,4,6,...,100.Step 2: remaining digits are positions 4,8,12,...,100.Step 3: remaining digits are positions 8,16,24,...,96.Wait, but 100 is not a multiple of 8, so maybe 96 is the last one.Wait, let me check.Wait, step 1: 100 digits, cross out odds, leaving 50 digits.Step 2: 50 digits, cross out odds, leaving 25 digits.Step 3: 25 digits, cross out odds, leaving 12 digits.Wait, but 25 is odd, so when crossing out odds, we remove 13 digits, leaving 12.So, the remaining digits are the even positions of the 25-digit number.But the 25-digit number is the even positions of the 50-digit number, which is the even positions of the original 100-digit number.Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the positions that survive each step.Each step, the remaining digits are the even positions of the previous step.So, after step 1: positions 2,4,6,...,100.After step 2: positions 4,8,12,...,100.After step 3: positions 8,16,24,...,96.After step 4: positions 16,32,48,64,80,96.After step 5: positions 32,64,96.After step 6: positions 64.So, the last remaining digit is at position 64.But the question is about the last digit crossed out, not the last remaining.So, in each step, the digits crossed out are the odd positions of the current number.So, in step 1: crossed out positions 1,3,5,...,99.In step 2: crossed out positions 1,3,5,...,49 of the 50-digit number, which correspond to positions 2,6,10,...,98 of the original number.In step 3: crossed out positions 1,3,5,...,25 of the 25-digit number, which correspond to positions 4,12,20,...,100 of the original number.Wait, hold on.Wait, the 25-digit number is the even positions of the 50-digit number, which is positions 4,8,12,...,100.So, crossing out the odd positions of this 25-digit number would correspond to positions 4,12,20,...,100.Wait, but 25 is odd, so the last crossed out position in step 3 is position 25 of the 25-digit number, which is position 100 of the original number.So, the last digit crossed out in step 3 is 100, which is 0.Then, step 4: the remaining digits after step 3 are positions 8,16,24,...,96.So, 12 digits.Crossing out the odd positions: positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 of this 12-digit number, which correspond to positions 8,24,40,56,72,88 of the original number.So, the last digit crossed out in step 4 is position 88, which is digit 8.Step 5: remaining digits are positions 16,32,48,64,80,96.Crossing out the odd positions: positions 1,3,5 of this 6-digit number, which correspond to positions 16,48,80.So, the last digit crossed out in step 5 is position 80, which is digit 0.Step 6: remaining digits are positions 32,64,96.Crossing out the odd positions: position 1 of this 3-digit number, which is position 32.So, the last digit crossed out in step 6 is position 32, which is digit 2.Wait, but step 6 is crossing out the first digit of the 3-digit number, which is position 32, so digit 2.But then, after that, we have two digits left: positions 64 and 96.Wait, but in step 6, we cross out position 32, leaving positions 64 and 96.Then, step 7: crossing out the odd position of the 2-digit number, which is position 1, corresponding to position 64.So, the last digit crossed out is position 64, which is digit 4.Wait, but hold on. Let me recount.Wait, step 1: cross out 1,3,...,99 (last crossed out:99)Step 2: cross out 2,6,...,98 (last crossed out:98)Step 3: cross out 4,12,...,100 (last crossed out:100)Step 4: cross out 8,24,...,88 (last crossed out:88)Step 5: cross out 16,48,...,80 (last crossed out:80)Step 6: cross out 32 (last crossed out:32)Step 7: cross out 64 (last crossed out:64)Wait, but after step 6, we have two digits left: 64 and 96.So, step 7: cross out the odd position, which is 64.So, the last digit crossed out is 64, which is digit 4.But wait, in the original number, position 64 is which digit?Let me calculate.The original number is 12345678901234567890... up to 100 digits.Each 10 digits cycle through 1-0.So, position 64: 64 divided by 10 is 6 with remainder 4. So, the 6th cycle is 1234567890, so the 4th digit is 4.So, position 64 is 4.So, the last digit crossed out is 4.But wait, let me check.Wait, in step 7, we cross out position 64, which is the first digit of the two remaining digits. So, the last crossed out digit is 64, which is 4.But let me think again.Wait, step 1: cross out 1,3,...,99. Last crossed out:99 (digit 9)Step 2: cross out 2,6,...,98. Last crossed out:98 (digit 8)Step 3: cross out 4,12,...,100. Last crossed out:100 (digit 0)Step 4: cross out 8,24,...,88. Last crossed out:88 (digit 8)Step 5: cross out 16,48,...,80. Last crossed out:80 (digit 0)Step 6: cross out 32. Last crossed out:32 (digit 2)Step 7: cross out 64. Last crossed out:64 (digit 4)So, the last digit crossed out is 4.But wait, let me check the process again.After step 6, we have two digits left: position 64 and 96.So, step 7: cross out the odd position, which is position 64.So, the last digit crossed out is 64, which is 4.But let me confirm the digits at these positions.Position 64: as above, 64 mod 10 is 4, so digit 4.Position 96: 96 mod 10 is 6, so digit 6.So, after crossing out 64, we're left with 96, which is 6.But the question is about the last digit crossed out, which is 64, digit 4.Wait, but let me think about the process again.Each step, we cross out the odd positions of the current number.So, step 1: cross out 1,3,...,99 (original positions)Step 2: cross out 2,6,...,98 (original positions)Step 3: cross out 4,12,...,100 (original positions)Step 4: cross out 8,24,...,88 (original positions)Step 5: cross out 16,48,...,80 (original positions)Step 6: cross out 32 (original position)Step 7: cross out 64 (original position)So, the last digit crossed out is at position 64, which is 4.Therefore, the answer should be 4.Wait, but let me check another way.Alternatively, think about the positions that are crossed out in each step.Each step, the positions crossed out are those congruent to 1 mod 2^k, where k is the step number.Wait, maybe not exactly, but the positions that survive are those divisible by 2^k.Wait, in step 1, positions remaining are 2,4,6,...,100 (divisible by 2)Step 2: positions remaining are 4,8,12,...,100 (divisible by 4)Step 3: positions remaining are 8,16,24,...,96 (divisible by 8)Step 4: positions remaining are 16,32,48,64,80,96 (divisible by 16)Step 5: positions remaining are 32,64,96 (divisible by 32)Step 6: positions remaining are 64 (divisible by 64)So, the last remaining digit is at position 64, which is 4.But the last digit crossed out would be the one just before that, which is position 32.Wait, but in step 6, we cross out position 32, leaving 64 and 96.Then in step 7, we cross out position 64, leaving 96.So, the last crossed out is 64.But according to this, 64 is the last crossed out.But let me think about the steps again.Step 1: cross out 1,3,...,99 (last crossed out:99)Step 2: cross out 2,6,...,98 (last crossed out:98)Step 3: cross out 4,12,...,100 (last crossed out:100)Step 4: cross out 8,24,...,88 (last crossed out:88)Step 5: cross out 16,48,...,80 (last crossed out:80)Step 6: cross out 32 (last crossed out:32)Step 7: cross out 64 (last crossed out:64)So, the last digit crossed out is 64, which is 4.Therefore, the answer is 4.But wait, let me check the digits at these positions.Position 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:7, 8:8, 9:9, 10:0,11:1,12:2,13:3,14:4,15:5,16:6,17:7,18:8,19:9,20:0,21:1,22:2,23:3,24:4,25:5,26:6,27:7,28:8,29:9,30:0,31:1,32:2,33:3,34:4,35:5,36:6,37:7,38:8,39:9,40:0,41:1,42:2,43:3,44:4,45:5,46:6,47:7,48:8,49:9,50:0,51:1,52:2,53:3,54:4,55:5,56:6,57:7,58:8,59:9,60:0,61:1,62:2,63:3,64:4,65:5,66:6,67:7,68:8,69:9,70:0,71:1,72:2,73:3,74:4,75:5,76:6,77:7,78:8,79:9,80:0,81:1,82:2,83:3,84:4,85:5,86:6,87:7,88:8,89:9,90:0,91:1,92:2,93:3,94:4,95:5,96:6,97:7,98:8,99:9,100:0.So, position 64:4Position 32:2Position 80:0Position 88:8Position 96:6Position 98:8Position 99:9Position 100:0So, in step 1, last crossed out:99:9Step 2:98:8Step3:100:0Step4:88:8Step5:80:0Step6:32:2Step7:64:4So, the last digit crossed out is 4.Therefore, the answer is 4.But wait, let me think again.Is there a pattern here? The last crossed out digit in each step is 9,8,0,8,0,2,4.So, the last crossed out digit is 4.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the digit at position 64, which is 4.Yes, that seems consistent.So, I think the answer is 4."},{"question":"Let ( x ) and ( y ) be positive integers. Can ( x^{2} + 2y ) and ( y^{2} + 2x ) both be squares?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if there are positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that both ( x^{2} + 2y ) and ( y^{2} + 2x ) are perfect squares. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me write down the two expressions:1. ( x^{2} + 2y = a^{2} ) for some integer ( a ).2. ( y^{2} + 2x = b^{2} ) for some integer ( b ).So, I need to find positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that both these equations hold true. I guess I can start by assuming that ( x ) and ( y ) are equal. Maybe that could simplify things? Let me try setting ( x = y ).If ( x = y ), then both equations become:1. ( x^{2} + 2x = a^{2} )2. ( x^{2} + 2x = b^{2} )So, both ( a ) and ( b ) would be equal in this case. Let me denote this as ( x^{2} + 2x = k^{2} ) where ( k ) is some integer. So, I have:( x^{2} + 2x = k^{2} )Let me rearrange this equation:( k^{2} - x^{2} = 2x )Which can be factored as:( (k - x)(k + x) = 2x )Now, since ( k ) and ( x ) are positive integers, both ( k - x ) and ( k + x ) are positive integers as well, with ( k + x > k - x ). Also, their product is ( 2x ).Let me denote ( d_1 = k - x ) and ( d_2 = k + x ). So, ( d_1 times d_2 = 2x ) and ( d_2 > d_1 ). Also, since ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ) are factors of ( 2x ), they must satisfy ( d_1 leq d_2 ).Moreover, since ( d_1 + d_2 = 2k ) and ( d_2 - d_1 = 2x ), we can write:( d_1 + d_2 = 2k )( d_2 - d_1 = 2x )Let me solve these two equations for ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ). Adding them together:( 2d_2 = 2k + 2x ) => ( d_2 = k + x )Subtracting them:( 2d_1 = 2k - 2x ) => ( d_1 = k - x )Which is consistent with our earlier definitions.But since ( d_1 times d_2 = 2x ), and ( d_2 = k + x ), let's substitute ( d_1 = k - x ):( (k - x)(k + x) = 2x )Which is the same as:( k^2 - x^2 = 2x )Which brings us back to the original equation. So, perhaps I need another approach.Let me consider small values of ( x ) and see if ( x^2 + 2x ) is a perfect square.For ( x = 1 ): ( 1 + 2 = 3 ), not a square.( x = 2 ): ( 4 + 4 = 8 ), not a square.( x = 3 ): ( 9 + 6 = 15 ), not a square.( x = 4 ): ( 16 + 8 = 24 ), not a square.( x = 5 ): ( 25 + 10 = 35 ), not a square.( x = 6 ): ( 36 + 12 = 48 ), not a square.( x = 7 ): ( 49 + 14 = 63 ), not a square.( x = 8 ): ( 64 + 16 = 80 ), not a square.( x = 9 ): ( 81 + 18 = 99 ), not a square.( x = 10 ): ( 100 + 20 = 120 ), not a square.Hmm, seems like for ( x = y ), there are no solutions up to ( x = 10 ). Maybe I need to check higher values, but this might not be the most efficient way. Perhaps I should try a different approach.Let me consider the two original equations again:1. ( x^{2} + 2y = a^{2} )2. ( y^{2} + 2x = b^{2} )Maybe I can subtract the two equations to find a relationship between ( x ) and ( y ).Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:( x^{2} + 2y - (y^{2} + 2x) = a^{2} - b^{2} )Simplify:( x^{2} - y^{2} + 2y - 2x = (a - b)(a + b) )Factor the left side:( (x - y)(x + y) - 2(x - y) = (a - b)(a + b) )Factor out ( (x - y) ):( (x - y)(x + y - 2) = (a - b)(a + b) )Hmm, so ( (x - y)(x + y - 2) ) must be equal to ( (a - b)(a + b) ). Since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers, ( a + b ) is positive, and ( a - b ) could be positive or negative. But since ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers, ( x - y ) could also be positive or negative.Let me assume without loss of generality that ( x geq y ). So, ( x - y geq 0 ). Then, ( (x - y)(x + y - 2) ) is non-negative. Therefore, ( (a - b)(a + b) ) must also be non-negative. Since ( a + b ) is always positive, ( a - b ) must be non-negative as well. So, ( a geq b ).So, ( x geq y ) and ( a geq b ).Alternatively, if ( y > x ), then ( x - y ) is negative, so ( (x - y)(x + y - 2) ) is negative, which would imply that ( (a - b)(a + b) ) is negative. But since ( a + b ) is positive, ( a - b ) must be negative, so ( a < b ). So, in that case, ( y > x ) and ( a < b ).But maybe it's simpler to assume ( x geq y ) and proceed.So, ( x geq y ), ( a geq b ).Let me write ( x = y + k ) where ( k ) is a non-negative integer.So, substituting ( x = y + k ) into the equations:1. ( (y + k)^2 + 2y = a^2 )2. ( y^2 + 2(y + k) = b^2 )Let me expand equation 1:( y^2 + 2ky + k^2 + 2y = a^2 )Simplify:( y^2 + (2k + 2)y + k^2 = a^2 )Similarly, equation 2:( y^2 + 2y + 2k = b^2 )So, now we have:1. ( y^2 + (2k + 2)y + k^2 = a^2 )2. ( y^2 + 2y + 2k = b^2 )Let me denote equation 2 as:( b^2 = y^2 + 2y + 2k )So, ( b^2 = (y + 1)^2 + (2k - 1) )Hmm, interesting. So, ( b^2 ) is slightly larger than ( (y + 1)^2 ).Similarly, equation 1 can be written as:( a^2 = y^2 + (2k + 2)y + k^2 )Let me see if I can write this in terms of ( (y + m)^2 ) for some ( m ).Let me compute ( (y + m)^2 = y^2 + 2my + m^2 ). Comparing this to equation 1:( y^2 + (2k + 2)y + k^2 = y^2 + 2my + m^2 )So, equating coefficients:( 2m = 2k + 2 ) => ( m = k + 1 )And ( m^2 = k^2 ) => ( (k + 1)^2 = k^2 )But ( (k + 1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 ), which is not equal to ( k^2 ) unless ( 2k + 1 = 0 ), which is impossible since ( k ) is a non-negative integer.So, that approach doesn't quite work. Maybe I can think of ( a^2 ) as being between ( (y + k + 1)^2 ) and ( (y + k)^2 ) or something like that.Wait, let's compute ( (y + k + 1)^2 = y^2 + 2(k + 1)y + (k + 1)^2 )Compare with equation 1:( y^2 + (2k + 2)y + k^2 )So, the difference between ( (y + k + 1)^2 ) and equation 1 is:( [y^2 + 2(k + 1)y + (k + 1)^2] - [y^2 + (2k + 2)y + k^2] = (k + 1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1 )So, ( a^2 = (y + k + 1)^2 - (2k + 1) )Therefore, ( a^2 + (2k + 1) = (y + k + 1)^2 )So, ( (y + k + 1)^2 - a^2 = 2k + 1 )Which can be factored as:( (y + k + 1 - a)(y + k + 1 + a) = 2k + 1 )Since ( 2k + 1 ) is an odd number, both factors on the left must be odd as well. Let me denote:( d_1 = y + k + 1 - a )( d_2 = y + k + 1 + a )So, ( d_1 times d_2 = 2k + 1 )Also, since ( d_2 > d_1 ) and both are positive integers (since ( y + k + 1 > a ) because ( a^2 = (y + k + 1)^2 - (2k + 1) ), which is less than ( (y + k + 1)^2 )), we can write:( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ) are positive divisors of ( 2k + 1 ) with ( d_2 > d_1 ) and ( d_1 times d_2 = 2k + 1 ).Moreover, since ( 2k + 1 ) is odd, all its divisors are odd.Let me note that ( d_1 + d_2 = 2(y + k + 1) ). Because:( d_1 + d_2 = (y + k + 1 - a) + (y + k + 1 + a) = 2(y + k + 1) )So, ( d_1 + d_2 = 2(y + k + 1) )Also, ( d_2 - d_1 = 2a ). Because:( d_2 - d_1 = (y + k + 1 + a) - (y + k + 1 - a) = 2a )So, now we have:1. ( d_1 times d_2 = 2k + 1 )2. ( d_1 + d_2 = 2(y + k + 1) )3. ( d_2 - d_1 = 2a )Since ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ) are divisors of ( 2k + 1 ), and ( 2k + 1 ) is odd, let me consider the possible pairs ( (d_1, d_2) ).Given that ( d_1 times d_2 = 2k + 1 ), and ( d_2 > d_1 ), the possible pairs are ( (1, 2k + 1) ) since ( 2k + 1 ) is prime or composite.Wait, but ( 2k + 1 ) could be prime or composite. If it's prime, then the only divisors are 1 and itself. If it's composite, there could be more pairs.But let's first consider the case where ( 2k + 1 ) is prime. Then, the only possible pair is ( (1, 2k + 1) ).So, in that case:( d_1 = 1 )( d_2 = 2k + 1 )Then, from equation 2:( d_1 + d_2 = 1 + (2k + 1) = 2k + 2 = 2(y + k + 1) )So,( 2k + 2 = 2(y + k + 1) )Divide both sides by 2:( k + 1 = y + k + 1 )Which simplifies to:( y = 0 )But ( y ) is a positive integer, so this is impossible. Therefore, if ( 2k + 1 ) is prime, there is no solution.So, ( 2k + 1 ) must be composite. Let me consider that ( 2k + 1 ) is composite, so it has more than two divisors.Let me denote ( 2k + 1 = m times n ), where ( m ) and ( n ) are integers greater than 1, and ( m < n ).Then, the possible pairs ( (d_1, d_2) ) are ( (m, n) ), ( (1, mn) ), etc. But since ( m ) and ( n ) are both greater than 1, ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ) could be ( (m, n) ) or ( (1, mn) ). But we already saw that ( (1, mn) ) leads to ( y = 0 ), which is invalid. So, let's try the pair ( (m, n) ).So, ( d_1 = m ), ( d_2 = n ).Then, from equation 2:( m + n = 2(y + k + 1) )And from equation 3:( n - m = 2a )Also, since ( m times n = 2k + 1 ), we can express ( k = frac{mn - 1}{2} ).Let me try to express ( y ) in terms of ( m ) and ( n ).From equation 2:( m + n = 2(y + k + 1) )We can substitute ( k = frac{mn - 1}{2} ):( m + n = 2left(y + frac{mn - 1}{2} + 1right) )Simplify inside the parentheses:( y + frac{mn - 1}{2} + 1 = y + frac{mn - 1 + 2}{2} = y + frac{mn + 1}{2} )So, equation becomes:( m + n = 2left(y + frac{mn + 1}{2}right) )Multiply through:( m + n = 2y + mn + 1 )Rearrange:( 2y = m + n - mn - 1 )So,( y = frac{m + n - mn - 1}{2} )Hmm, since ( y ) must be a positive integer, the numerator must be positive and even.So,( m + n - mn - 1 > 0 )Let me rearrange:( -mn + m + n - 1 > 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips):( mn - m - n + 1 < 0 )Which can be written as:( (m - 1)(n - 1) < 1 )Since ( m ) and ( n ) are integers greater than 1 (because ( 2k + 1 ) is composite and ( m, n > 1 )), ( (m - 1)(n - 1) ) is at least ( (2 - 1)(2 - 1) = 1 ). So, ( (m - 1)(n - 1) geq 1 ). But the inequality says ( (m - 1)(n - 1) < 1 ). Therefore, the only possibility is ( (m - 1)(n - 1) = 0 ), but since ( m, n > 1 ), this is impossible.Wait, that seems like a contradiction. So, does that mean there are no solutions when ( 2k + 1 ) is composite either?But that can't be, because if ( 2k + 1 ) is composite, then ( m ) and ( n ) are factors greater than 1, but the above leads to a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps my assumption that ( x geq y ) is leading me to a dead end.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the case where ( x < y ). Let me try that.So, if ( x < y ), then ( x - y ) is negative, so ( (x - y)(x + y - 2) ) is negative, which implies ( (a - b)(a + b) ) is negative. Since ( a + b ) is positive, ( a - b ) must be negative, so ( a < b ).So, in this case, ( y > x ) and ( b > a ).Let me try a similar substitution. Let me set ( y = x + k ) where ( k ) is a positive integer.Then, substituting into the equations:1. ( x^{2} + 2(x + k) = a^{2} )2. ( (x + k)^{2} + 2x = b^{2} )Let me expand both equations:1. ( x^{2} + 2x + 2k = a^{2} )2. ( x^{2} + 2kx + k^{2} + 2x = b^{2} )So, equation 1 is:( a^{2} = x^{2} + 2x + 2k )Equation 2 is:( b^{2} = x^{2} + 2(k + 1)x + k^{2} )Let me try to analyze equation 1 first.Equation 1: ( a^{2} = x^{2} + 2x + 2k )Let me write this as:( a^{2} = (x + 1)^2 + (2k - 1) )So, ( a^{2} ) is slightly larger than ( (x + 1)^2 ).Similarly, equation 2: ( b^{2} = x^{2} + 2(k + 1)x + k^{2} )Let me see if I can write this as a square.Let me compute ( (x + m)^2 = x^2 + 2mx + m^2 ). Comparing to equation 2:( x^2 + 2(k + 1)x + k^2 = x^2 + 2mx + m^2 )So, equating coefficients:( 2m = 2(k + 1) ) => ( m = k + 1 )And ( m^2 = k^2 ) => ( (k + 1)^2 = k^2 )Which simplifies to ( 2k + 1 = 0 ), which is impossible since ( k ) is a positive integer.So, similar to before, equation 2 can't be expressed as a perfect square in this way. Maybe I can consider ( b^2 ) as being between ( (x + k + 1)^2 ) and ( (x + k)^2 ).Compute ( (x + k + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2(k + 1)x + (k + 1)^2 )Compare to equation 2:( x^2 + 2(k + 1)x + k^2 )So, the difference is:( (x + k + 1)^2 - b^2 = (k + 1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1 )So, ( b^2 = (x + k + 1)^2 - (2k + 1) )Therefore, ( (x + k + 1)^2 - b^2 = 2k + 1 )Which factors as:( (x + k + 1 - b)(x + k + 1 + b) = 2k + 1 )Again, since ( 2k + 1 ) is odd, both factors are odd. Let me denote:( d_1 = x + k + 1 - b )( d_2 = x + k + 1 + b )So, ( d_1 times d_2 = 2k + 1 )Also, ( d_1 + d_2 = 2(x + k + 1) )And ( d_2 - d_1 = 2b )Similarly, as before, since ( 2k + 1 ) is odd, the factors ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ) must be 1 and ( 2k + 1 ), or other factor pairs if ( 2k + 1 ) is composite.But if ( 2k + 1 ) is prime, then the only factors are 1 and itself. So, let's try that case first.Case 1: ( 2k + 1 ) is prime.Then, ( d_1 = 1 ), ( d_2 = 2k + 1 )From ( d_1 + d_2 = 2(x + k + 1) ):( 1 + (2k + 1) = 2(x + k + 1) )Simplify:( 2k + 2 = 2x + 2k + 2 )Subtract ( 2k + 2 ) from both sides:( 0 = 2x )Which implies ( x = 0 ), but ( x ) is a positive integer. So, no solution in this case.Case 2: ( 2k + 1 ) is composite.So, ( 2k + 1 = m times n ), where ( m ) and ( n ) are integers greater than 1, and ( m < n ).Then, possible factor pairs ( (d_1, d_2) ) are ( (m, n) ) and ( (1, mn) ). But as before, ( (1, mn) ) leads to ( x = 0 ), which is invalid. So, let's try ( (m, n) ).So, ( d_1 = m ), ( d_2 = n )From ( d_1 + d_2 = 2(x + k + 1) ):( m + n = 2(x + k + 1) )From ( d_2 - d_1 = 2b ):( n - m = 2b )Also, ( m times n = 2k + 1 ), so ( k = frac{mn - 1}{2} )Let me try to express ( x ) in terms of ( m ) and ( n ).From ( m + n = 2(x + k + 1) ):Substitute ( k = frac{mn - 1}{2} ):( m + n = 2left(x + frac{mn - 1}{2} + 1right) )Simplify inside the parentheses:( x + frac{mn - 1}{2} + 1 = x + frac{mn - 1 + 2}{2} = x + frac{mn + 1}{2} )So, equation becomes:( m + n = 2left(x + frac{mn + 1}{2}right) )Multiply through:( m + n = 2x + mn + 1 )Rearrange:( 2x = m + n - mn - 1 )So,( x = frac{m + n - mn - 1}{2} )Again, since ( x ) must be a positive integer, the numerator must be positive and even.So,( m + n - mn - 1 > 0 )Rearranged:( -mn + m + n - 1 > 0 )Multiply by -1:( mn - m - n + 1 < 0 )Which is:( (m - 1)(n - 1) < 1 )Since ( m ) and ( n ) are integers greater than 1, ( (m - 1)(n - 1) geq 1 ). Therefore, the inequality ( (m - 1)(n - 1) < 1 ) can't be satisfied. So, again, no solution.Hmm, so whether ( x geq y ) or ( x < y ), assuming ( x = y + k ) or ( y = x + k ), we end up with contradictions unless ( y ) or ( x ) is zero, which is not allowed.This suggests that perhaps there are no solutions where ( x neq y ). But wait, earlier when I tried ( x = y ), I didn't find any solutions up to ( x = 10 ). Maybe I need to check higher values or perhaps consider that no solutions exist.Alternatively, maybe I should approach this problem differently. Let me consider the two equations again:1. ( x^{2} + 2y = a^{2} )2. ( y^{2} + 2x = b^{2} )Let me try to bound ( a ) and ( b ) in terms of ( x ) and ( y ).For equation 1: ( a^{2} = x^{2} + 2y ). Since ( 2y > 0 ), ( a > x ). Similarly, ( a^{2} = x^{2} + 2y < x^{2} + 2y + y^{2} ) (if ( y geq 1 )), which is ( (x + y)^2 ). Wait, not necessarily. Let me check:Wait, ( x^{2} + 2y ) vs ( (x + 1)^2 ). Let me compute ( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 ). So, ( a^{2} = x^{2} + 2y ). So, if ( 2y < 2x + 1 ), then ( a^{2} < (x + 1)^2 ), so ( a leq x ). But ( a > x ) because ( 2y > 0 ). So, ( a ) must be ( x + 1 ) if ( 2y < 2x + 1 ). Wait, let me think.Wait, ( a^{2} = x^{2} + 2y ). The next square after ( x^2 ) is ( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 ). So, if ( 2y < 2x + 1 ), then ( a^2 < (x + 1)^2 ), so ( a leq x ). But ( a^2 > x^2 ), so ( a ) must be ( x + 1 ). But ( a leq x ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( 2y geq 2x + 1 ), so ( y geq x + frac{1}{2} ). Since ( y ) is an integer, ( y geq x + 1 ).Similarly, for equation 2: ( b^{2} = y^{2} + 2x ). The next square after ( y^2 ) is ( (y + 1)^2 = y^2 + 2y + 1 ). So, if ( 2x < 2y + 1 ), then ( b^2 < (y + 1)^2 ), so ( b leq y ). But ( b^2 > y^2 ), so ( b ) must be ( y + 1 ). But ( b leq y ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( 2x geq 2y + 1 ), so ( x geq y + frac{1}{2} ). Since ( x ) is an integer, ( x geq y + 1 ).Wait, this is interesting. From equation 1, we get ( y geq x + 1 ), and from equation 2, we get ( x geq y + 1 ). So, combining these two inequalities:( y geq x + 1 ) and ( x geq y + 1 )Which implies:( y geq x + 1 geq (y + 1) + 1 = y + 2 )So,( y geq y + 2 )Which simplifies to:( 0 geq 2 )Which is a contradiction.Therefore, there are no positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that both ( x^{2} + 2y ) and ( y^{2} + 2x ) are perfect squares.Wait, that seems like a solid conclusion. Let me recap:From equation 1, we deduced that ( y geq x + 1 ).From equation 2, we deduced that ( x geq y + 1 ).Combining these gives ( y geq x + 1 geq (y + 1) + 1 = y + 2 ), which simplifies to ( y geq y + 2 ), which is impossible.Therefore, there are no such positive integers ( x ) and ( y ).I think this is a valid argument. So, the answer is no, such positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) do not exist.**Final Answer**boxed{No}"},{"question":"Calculate:<br/>(1)(-11)+8+(-14);<br/>(2)13-(-12)+(-21).","answer":"First, I'll tackle the first expression: (1)(-11) + 8 + (-14).Multiplying 1 by -11 gives -11.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.First, let me rewrite the expression to make sure I understand it correctly. It's (log_{2}^{4} x), which I believe means ((log_{2} x)^4), right? And then the second term is (12 log_{2}^{2} x log_{2} frac{8}{x}), which would be (12 (log_{2} x)^2 times log_{2} frac{8}{x}). So, putting it all together, the expression is:[(log_{2} x)^4 + 12 (log_{2} x)^2 log_{2} left(frac{8}{x}right)]Alright, so maybe I can simplify this expression by substituting (y = log_{2} x). That might make things easier. Let me try that.Let (y = log_{2} x). Then, since (x) ranges from 1 to 64, (y) will range from (log_{2} 1 = 0) to (log_{2} 64 = 6). So, (y in [0, 6]).Now, let's express the original expression in terms of (y). The first term is straightforward: ((log_{2} x)^4 = y^4). The second term is (12 (log_{2} x)^2 log_{2} frac{8}{x}). Let me simplify (log_{2} frac{8}{x}).Using logarithm properties, (log_{2} frac{8}{x} = log_{2} 8 - log_{2} x). Since (log_{2} 8 = 3) (because (2^3 = 8)), this simplifies to (3 - y).So, substituting back into the second term, we have:[12 (log_{2} x)^2 log_{2} frac{8}{x} = 12 y^2 (3 - y)]Therefore, the entire expression becomes:[y^4 + 12 y^2 (3 - y)]Let me expand that second term:[12 y^2 (3 - y) = 36 y^2 - 12 y^3]So, the expression is now:[y^4 + 36 y^2 - 12 y^3]Let me rearrange the terms in descending order of powers:[y^4 - 12 y^3 + 36 y^2]Hmm, so now I have a quartic function in terms of (y). To find its maximum on the interval (y in [0, 6]), I can use calculus. I'll need to find the derivative of this function with respect to (y), set it equal to zero, and solve for (y). Then, I can check the critical points and the endpoints to determine where the maximum occurs.Let me compute the derivative. Let (f(y) = y^4 - 12 y^3 + 36 y^2). Then,[f'(y) = 4 y^3 - 36 y^2 + 72 y]Simplify that:[f'(y) = 4 y^3 - 36 y^2 + 72 y]I can factor out a common factor of 4y:[f'(y) = 4 y (y^2 - 9 y + 18)]Wait, let me check that. 4y times (y^2 - 9y + 18) would be 4y^3 - 36y^2 + 72y, which matches. So, that's correct.Now, to find critical points, set (f'(y) = 0):[4 y (y^2 - 9 y + 18) = 0]This gives us two factors: (4 y = 0) and (y^2 - 9 y + 18 = 0).Solving (4 y = 0) gives (y = 0).Solving (y^2 - 9 y + 18 = 0). Let's use the quadratic formula:[y = frac{9 pm sqrt{81 - 72}}{2} = frac{9 pm sqrt{9}}{2} = frac{9 pm 3}{2}]So, the solutions are:[y = frac{9 + 3}{2} = 6 quad text{and} quad y = frac{9 - 3}{2} = 3]Therefore, the critical points are at (y = 0), (y = 3), and (y = 6). These are the points where the function could have local maxima or minima.Now, since we're looking for the maximum value of (f(y)) on the interval ([0, 6]), we need to evaluate (f(y)) at these critical points and also at the endpoints of the interval, which are (y = 0) and (y = 6). Wait, but (y = 0) and (y = 6) are already critical points, so we just need to evaluate (f(y)) at (y = 0), (y = 3), and (y = 6).Let me compute (f(y)) at each of these points.First, at (y = 0):[f(0) = 0^4 - 12 times 0^3 + 36 times 0^2 = 0]Next, at (y = 3):[f(3) = 3^4 - 12 times 3^3 + 36 times 3^2]Calculating each term:- (3^4 = 81)- (12 times 3^3 = 12 times 27 = 324)- (36 times 3^2 = 36 times 9 = 324)So,[f(3) = 81 - 324 + 324 = 81]Wait, that simplifies nicely. The -324 and +324 cancel out, leaving 81.Now, at (y = 6):[f(6) = 6^4 - 12 times 6^3 + 36 times 6^2]Calculating each term:- (6^4 = 1296)- (12 times 6^3 = 12 times 216 = 2592)- (36 times 6^2 = 36 times 36 = 1296)So,[f(6) = 1296 - 2592 + 1296]Again, 1296 - 2592 is -1296, and then +1296 brings it back to 0.Therefore, (f(6) = 0).So, summarizing the function values:- (f(0) = 0)- (f(3) = 81)- (f(6) = 0)Therefore, the maximum value of (f(y)) on the interval ([0, 6]) is 81, achieved at (y = 3).But wait, before I conclude, I should make sure that there are no other critical points or that the function doesn't attain a higher value somewhere else in the interval. Since we found all critical points by setting the derivative to zero and evaluated the function at those points, and since the function is a polynomial, which is smooth and continuous, the maximum must occur at one of these critical points or endpoints.Given that (f(3) = 81) is higher than the other evaluated points, which are both 0, it's safe to say that 81 is indeed the maximum value.Now, just to make sure, let me double-check my calculations.First, for (f(3)):- (3^4 = 81)- (12 times 3^3 = 12 times 27 = 324)- (36 times 3^2 = 36 times 9 = 324)- So, (81 - 324 + 324 = 81). Correct.For (f(6)):- (6^4 = 1296)- (12 times 6^3 = 12 times 216 = 2592)- (36 times 6^2 = 36 times 36 = 1296)- So, (1296 - 2592 + 1296 = 0). Correct.And (f(0)) is obviously 0.So, all calculations check out.Therefore, the maximum value of the original expression is 81, achieved when (y = 3). Since (y = log_{2} x), that means:[log_{2} x = 3 implies x = 2^3 = 8]So, when (x = 8), the expression reaches its maximum value of 81.Just to be thorough, I can also analyze the behavior of the function around (y = 3) to ensure it's indeed a maximum. Let's pick a value slightly less than 3, say (y = 2), and a value slightly more than 3, say (y = 4), and see if the function value is less than 81.Compute (f(2)):[f(2) = 2^4 - 12 times 2^3 + 36 times 2^2 = 16 - 96 + 144 = 64]Compute (f(4)):[f(4) = 4^4 - 12 times 4^3 + 36 times 4^2 = 256 - 768 + 576 = 64]So, both (f(2)) and (f(4)) are 64, which is less than 81. This confirms that (y = 3) is indeed a local maximum, and since it's the highest among all critical points and endpoints, it's the global maximum on the interval.Therefore, I can confidently say that the maximum value of the given expression is 81, achieved when (x = 8).**Final Answer**The maximum value of the expression is boxed{81}."},{"question":"Is it possible to represent the expression (1+x^{2016} y^{2016}) in the form (f(x) cdot g(y))?

I need to figure out if such a representation is possible. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me understand what the question is asking. It wants to know if the given expression can be factored into two separate functions, one depending only on (x) and the other only on (y). So, (f(x)) would be a function that only has (x) terms, and (g(y)) would only have (y) terms. Their product should equal the original expression.The original expression is (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}). Let me write that down:(1 + x^{2016} y^{2016})I need to see if this can be expressed as (f(x) cdot g(y)). So, let's suppose that it is possible. Then, we can write:(1 + x^{2016} y^{2016} = f(x) cdot g(y))Now, my goal is to find functions (f(x)) and (g(y)) such that when multiplied together, they give the expression above. If I can find such functions, then the answer is yes; otherwise, no.Let me think about how to factor expressions. In algebra, we often factor expressions by looking for common terms or by recognizing patterns. For example, (a^2 + b^2) can be factored over complex numbers, but not over real numbers. However, in this case, the expression is (1 + (xy)^{2016}). That looks similar to (1 + z^{2016}), where (z = xy).Wait, so if I let (z = xy), then the expression becomes (1 + z^{2016}). Now, can I factor (1 + z^{2016}) into two functions, each depending on only one variable? Hmm, but (z) itself is a product of (x) and (y), so factoring it in terms of (z) might not directly help.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the original expression as a sum of two terms: 1 and (x^{2016} y^{2016}). If I can express each term as a product of functions depending on (x) and (y), maybe I can combine them somehow.But wait, 1 is a constant term. So, if I write 1 as (f_1(x) cdot g_1(y)), then (f_1(x)) and (g_1(y)) must both be constants, right? Because 1 can only be factored into constants multiplied together. Similarly, (x^{2016} y^{2016}) can be written as (f_2(x) cdot g_2(y)), where (f_2(x) = x^{2016}) and (g_2(y) = y^{2016}).But the original expression is the sum of these two products. So, we have:(1 + x^{2016} y^{2016} = f_1(x) cdot g_1(y) + f_2(x) cdot g_2(y))But the question is whether this entire expression can be written as a single product (f(x) cdot g(y)). So, we need to see if the sum of two products can be expressed as a single product.Hmm, that seems tricky. Let me think about whether such a representation is possible. Maybe I can consider specific values of (x) and (y) to test this.Let me choose specific values for (x) and (y) to see if the expression can be factored as a product of functions depending only on (x) and (y).First, let me set (x = 1). Then, the expression becomes:(1 + (1)^{2016} y^{2016} = 1 + y^{2016})So, if the original expression is (f(x) cdot g(y)), then when (x = 1), it should be equal to (f(1) cdot g(y)). Therefore, (1 + y^{2016} = f(1) cdot g(y)). Similarly, if I set (y = 1), the expression becomes:(1 + x^{2016} (1)^{2016} = 1 + x^{2016})Which should be equal to (f(x) cdot g(1)). So, (1 + x^{2016} = f(x) cdot g(1)).Therefore, from these two observations, we can see that:(1 + y^{2016} = f(1) cdot g(y))and(1 + x^{2016} = f(x) cdot g(1))So, if I can express (1 + y^{2016}) as a multiple of (g(y)), and (1 + x^{2016}) as a multiple of (f(x)), then maybe I can find (f(x)) and (g(y)).Let me denote (f(1) = a) and (g(1) = b). Then, from the above equations:(1 + y^{2016} = a cdot g(y))(1 + x^{2016} = f(x) cdot b)So, solving for (g(y)) and (f(x)):(g(y) = frac{1 + y^{2016}}{a})(f(x) = frac{1 + x^{2016}}{b})Now, since (f(x)) and (g(y)) are functions depending only on (x) and (y) respectively, this seems plausible. However, we also have the original expression:(1 + x^{2016} y^{2016} = f(x) cdot g(y))Substituting the expressions for (f(x)) and (g(y)):(1 + x^{2016} y^{2016} = left( frac{1 + x^{2016}}{b} right) cdot left( frac{1 + y^{2016}}{a} right))Simplify the right-hand side:(1 + x^{2016} y^{2016} = frac{(1 + x^{2016})(1 + y^{2016})}{a b})So, we have:((1 + x^{2016})(1 + y^{2016}) = a b (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}))Now, let me expand the left-hand side:((1 + x^{2016})(1 + y^{2016}) = 1 + x^{2016} + y^{2016} + x^{2016} y^{2016})So, substituting back:(1 + x^{2016} + y^{2016} + x^{2016} y^{2016} = a b (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}))Now, let's rearrange this equation:(1 + x^{2016} + y^{2016} + x^{2016} y^{2016} = a b + a b x^{2016} y^{2016})Now, let's bring all terms to one side:(1 + x^{2016} + y^{2016} + x^{2016} y^{2016} - a b - a b x^{2016} y^{2016} = 0)Simplify the terms:(1 - a b + x^{2016} + y^{2016} + (1 - a b) x^{2016} y^{2016} = 0)Now, for this equation to hold for all (x) and (y), each coefficient of the corresponding terms must be zero. Let's analyze each term:1. The constant term: (1 - a b = 0) ⇒ (a b = 1)2. The term with (x^{2016}): coefficient is 1, which must equal zero. But 1 ≠ 0, which is a contradiction.3. Similarly, the term with (y^{2016}): coefficient is 1, which must equal zero. Again, 1 ≠ 0, contradiction.4. The term with (x^{2016} y^{2016}): coefficient is (1 - a b). But since (a b = 1), this becomes 0, which is fine.So, we have a problem with the coefficients of (x^{2016}) and (y^{2016}). They are both 1, but in the equation, they need to be zero. This is impossible because 1 cannot equal 0. Therefore, our assumption that such functions (f(x)) and (g(y)) exist leads to a contradiction.Therefore, it is not possible to represent (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}) as a product of two functions (f(x)) and (g(y)).Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere.I assumed that (f(1) = a) and (g(1) = b), and then expressed (f(x)) and (g(y)) in terms of (a) and (b). Then, substituting back into the original equation led to a contradiction because the coefficients of (x^{2016}) and (y^{2016}) couldn't be zero.Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the degrees of the polynomials or something else.Let me think about the degrees. The original expression is (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}). If we consider this as a polynomial in two variables, its degree is 4032, since (x^{2016} y^{2016}) is degree 4032, and the constant term is degree 0.If we could factor this into (f(x) cdot g(y)), then both (f(x)) and (g(y)) would have to be polynomials as well, right? Because the product of polynomials is a polynomial.So, suppose (f(x)) is a polynomial in (x) and (g(y)) is a polynomial in (y). Then, the degree of (f(x)) times the degree of (g(y)) should equal the degree of the original expression.But wait, no. Actually, the degree of the product is the sum of the degrees if we consider each variable separately. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify.In a multivariate polynomial, the degree is the highest total degree of any term. So, in (f(x) cdot g(y)), each term is of the form (f_i(x) g_j(y)), so the total degree would be the sum of the degrees of (f_i(x)) and (g_j(y)). Therefore, the degree of the product is the sum of the degrees of (f(x)) and (g(y)).Wait, but in our case, the original expression has a term of degree 4032 ((x^{2016} y^{2016})) and a constant term. So, the degree of the product (f(x) cdot g(y)) must be 4032.Therefore, if (f(x)) is a polynomial of degree (m) and (g(y)) is a polynomial of degree (n), then (m + n = 4032).But in our case, the original expression is (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}). So, it has two terms: one of degree 0 and one of degree 4032.If we factor this into (f(x) cdot g(y)), then each term in the expansion of (f(x) cdot g(y)) must correspond to the terms in the original expression.But the original expression only has two terms: 1 and (x^{2016} y^{2016}). Therefore, the product (f(x) cdot g(y)) must also have only these two terms.But (f(x)) and (g(y)) are polynomials. So, unless they are monomials, their product would have more terms. For example, if (f(x) = a + b x^k) and (g(y) = c + d y^m), then their product would have four terms: (a c), (a d y^m), (b x^k c), and (b x^k d y^m). But our original expression only has two terms, so this suggests that (f(x)) and (g(y)) must themselves be monomials.Wait, that's an important point. If (f(x)) and (g(y)) are not monomials, their product will have more terms, which the original expression doesn't have. Therefore, (f(x)) and (g(y)) must be monomials.So, let's suppose that (f(x)) is a monomial in (x), say (f(x) = A x^k), and (g(y)) is a monomial in (y), say (g(y) = B y^m), where (A) and (B) are constants, and (k) and (m) are non-negative integers.Then, their product is (A B x^k y^m). But the original expression is (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}), which has two terms: 1 and (x^{2016} y^{2016}). So, how can a single monomial product equal an expression with two terms?It can't, unless one of the monomials is 1, but even then, it wouldn't work. Let me explain.Suppose (f(x)) is a monomial, say (A x^k), and (g(y)) is another monomial, say (B y^m). Then, their product is (A B x^k y^m). But the original expression is (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}), which is the sum of two monomials. So, unless (A B x^k y^m = 1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}), which is impossible because the left side is a single monomial and the right side is a sum of two monomials.Therefore, this suggests that (f(x)) and (g(y)) cannot both be monomials. But earlier, we saw that if they are not monomials, their product will have more terms, which the original expression doesn't have.So, this seems like a dead end. Therefore, it's impossible to factor (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}) into a product of two functions (f(x)) and (g(y)).Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can use non-polynomial functions? The problem doesn't specify that (f(x)) and (g(y)) have to be polynomials, just functions. So, perhaps there's a way to write it using non-polynomial functions?Hmm, that's a good point. The original problem doesn't restrict (f(x)) and (g(y)) to polynomials. They could be any functions, even transcendental functions.So, maybe I can define (f(x)) and (g(y)) in such a way that their product gives the desired expression. Let me explore this possibility.Let me denote (f(x) = 1 + x^{2016} h(x)), and (g(y) = 1 + y^{2016} k(y)), where (h(x)) and (k(y)) are some functions to be determined. Then, the product (f(x) cdot g(y)) would be:((1 + x^{2016} h(x))(1 + y^{2016} k(y)) = 1 + x^{2016} h(x) + y^{2016} k(y) + x^{2016} y^{2016} h(x) k(y))We want this to equal (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}). Therefore, we have:(1 + x^{2016} h(x) + y^{2016} k(y) + x^{2016} y^{2016} h(x) k(y) = 1 + x^{2016} y^{2016})Subtracting 1 from both sides:(x^{2016} h(x) + y^{2016} k(y) + x^{2016} y^{2016} h(x) k(y) = x^{2016} y^{2016})Now, let's rearrange:(x^{2016} h(x) + y^{2016} k(y) = x^{2016} y^{2016} (1 - h(x) k(y)))Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me see if I can find functions (h(x)) and (k(y)) that satisfy this equation.Alternatively, maybe I can set (h(x) = c x^m) and (k(y) = d y^n), where (c), (d), (m), and (n) are constants to be determined. Let's try this.So, (h(x) = c x^m) and (k(y) = d y^n). Then, substituting into the equation:(x^{2016} (c x^m) + y^{2016} (d y^n) = x^{2016} y^{2016} (1 - (c x^m)(d y^n)))Simplify:(c x^{2016 + m} + d y^{2016 + n} = x^{2016} y^{2016} - c d x^{2016 + m} y^{2016 + n})Now, let's collect like terms:Left side: (c x^{2016 + m} + d y^{2016 + n})Right side: (x^{2016} y^{2016} - c d x^{2016 + m} y^{2016 + n})For these two sides to be equal for all (x) and (y), the coefficients of corresponding terms must be equal.Looking at the left side, we have two terms: one in (x) and one in (y). On the right side, we have two terms: one is (x^{2016} y^{2016}) and the other is a term with (x^{2016 + m} y^{2016 + n}).Therefore, for the equation to hold, the left side must somehow cancel out the terms on the right side, except for the (x^{2016} y^{2016}) term.But this seems challenging because the left side has terms only in (x) and (y), while the right side has mixed terms.Wait, unless the exponents on the left side match the exponents on the right side. Let me see.Suppose that (2016 + m = 2016) and (2016 + n = 2016). Then, (m = 0) and (n = 0). So, (h(x) = c) and (k(y) = d). Let's try this.Then, substituting back:Left side: (c x^{2016} + d y^{2016})Right side: (x^{2016} y^{2016} - c d x^{2016} y^{2016})So, we have:(c x^{2016} + d y^{2016} = x^{2016} y^{2016} (1 - c d))But this equation must hold for all (x) and (y). However, the left side has terms only in (x) and (y) separately, while the right side has a term with both (x) and (y). The only way this can hold is if the coefficients of the (x) and (y) terms on the left side are zero, and the coefficient on the right side is also zero.So, setting coefficients:1. Coefficient of (x^{2016}): (c = 0)2. Coefficient of (y^{2016}): (d = 0)3. Coefficient of (x^{2016} y^{2016}): (1 - c d = 0)From the first two equations, (c = 0) and (d = 0). Substituting into the third equation: (1 - 0 = 1 neq 0). Contradiction.Therefore, this approach doesn't work either.Hmm, maybe I need to consider a different form for (f(x)) and (g(y)). Perhaps they are not polynomials but involve exponential or logarithmic functions? Let me think.Suppose I let (f(x) = e^{a x^{2016}}) and (g(y) = e^{b y^{2016}}). Then, their product is (e^{a x^{2016} + b y^{2016}}). But the original expression is (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}), which is a polynomial, while the exponential function is not a polynomial. So, unless (a) and (b) are chosen such that the exponential function equals the polynomial, which seems unlikely because exponentials and polynomials are different types of functions.Alternatively, maybe using logarithms? Hmm, not sure. Let me try another approach.Let me consider the original expression (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}). If I can write this as a product (f(x) g(y)), then taking logarithms on both sides would give:(ln(1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}) = ln(f(x)) + ln(g(y)))But the left side is a function of both (x) and (y), while the right side is the sum of two functions, each depending on only one variable. Is this possible?In general, it's difficult to separate a function of two variables into the sum of two single-variable functions unless the original function has a specific form. For example, if the function is additive in some way, but in this case, it's a logarithm of a sum, which complicates things.Alternatively, maybe I can use a different property. Let me think about the expression (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}). It can be written as (1 + (xy)^{2016}). So, if I set (z = xy), then the expression becomes (1 + z^{2016}). But then, (z) is a product of (x) and (y), so it's still a function of two variables.Wait, but if I can write (1 + z^{2016}) as a product of two functions, each depending on (z), but that's trivial because (1 + z^{2016}) is already a function of (z). However, we need functions depending on (x) and (y) separately, not on (z).So, unless (f(x)) and (g(y)) can be expressed in terms of (z), but that seems circular because (z) depends on both (x) and (y).Another thought: suppose I fix one variable and see how the expression behaves with respect to the other variable. For example, fix (x) and consider the expression as a function of (y). Then, (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}) is a function of (y), and if it can be written as (f(x) g(y)), then (g(y)) must be proportional to (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}), but scaled by (1/f(x)). However, this would require (f(x)) to be a function that cancels out the (x^{2016}) term when multiplied by (g(y)), which seems difficult.Wait, let me formalize this. Suppose I fix (x). Then, the expression becomes (1 + c y^{2016}), where (c = x^{2016}). If this can be written as (f(x) g(y)), then:(1 + c y^{2016} = f(x) g(y))But (f(x)) is a function of (x) only, and (g(y)) is a function of (y) only. So, for each fixed (x), (g(y)) must satisfy:(g(y) = frac{1 + c y^{2016}}{f(x)})But (g(y)) cannot depend on (x), so the right-hand side must be independent of (x). However, (c = x^{2016}) does depend on (x), which implies that (f(x)) must somehow cancel out the dependence on (x) in the numerator. But (f(x)) is only a function of (x), so unless (f(x)) is of the form (x^{k}), but even then, it's unclear how it would cancel out the (x^{2016}) term in the numerator.Wait, let's try to see. Suppose (f(x) = x^{k}), then (g(y) = frac{1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}}{x^{k}} = x^{-k} + x^{2016 - k} y^{2016}). But (g(y)) must be a function of (y) only, so the coefficient of (x^{-k}) must be zero unless (k = 0). If (k = 0), then (f(x) = 1), and (g(y) = 1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}), but (g(y)) still depends on (x), which is not allowed.Therefore, this approach doesn't work either.Another idea: Maybe the expression can be factored using some identity or special function. For example, (1 + z^{2016}) can be factored into cyclotomic polynomials, but those are still polynomials in (z), not in separate variables (x) and (y).Alternatively, perhaps using some kind of exponential or logarithmic identity, but I don't see an immediate way to do that.Wait, let me think about the degrees again. If (f(x)) and (g(y)) are polynomials, as I considered earlier, then their product must have degree 4032, but the original expression only has two terms. So, unless (f(x)) and (g(y)) are both monomials, but as we saw earlier, that doesn't work because their product would only have one term, not two.Alternatively, maybe (f(x)) and (g(y)) are not polynomials but involve higher-degree terms that somehow cancel out when multiplied. But I don't see how that would happen.Wait, another thought: Suppose (f(x)) is (1 + x^{2016}) and (g(y)) is (1 + y^{2016}). Then, their product is (1 + x^{2016} + y^{2016} + x^{2016} y^{2016}), which is more than our original expression. So, that's not helpful.Alternatively, if I set (f(x) = 1) and (g(y) = 1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}), but then (g(y)) depends on (x), which is not allowed.Similarly, if I set (f(x) = 1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}) and (g(y) = 1), same problem.So, it seems like no matter how I try to split the expression, one of the functions ends up depending on both variables, which violates the requirement.Wait, maybe using more complex functions. For example, suppose (f(x)) is a function that somehow incorporates (y) in its definition, but no, the problem specifies that (f(x)) depends only on (x) and (g(y)) depends only on (y).Therefore, after considering various approaches—polynomial factoring, substitution, logarithmic transformations, and others—it seems that it's impossible to express (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}) as a product of two functions (f(x)) and (g(y)) that depend solely on (x) and (y) respectively.The key reason is that the original expression has two terms, one of which is a constant and the other is a product of high-degree terms in both (x) and (y). When trying to factor this into a product of two single-variable functions, we end up needing to represent the sum of two terms as a product, which is not possible without introducing cross terms or dependencies that violate the single-variable requirement.Therefore, my conclusion is that it is not possible to represent (1 + x^{2016} y^{2016}) in the form (f(x) cdot g(y)).**Final Answer**boxed{No}"},{"question":"(1) Solve the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}2x-y=-4 4x-5y=-23end{array}right.; <br/>(2) Simplify first, then find the value: left(x-3yright)^{2}-left(2x+yright)left(y-2xright). Given x=2 and y=-1.","answer":"Alright, so I have two problems to solve here. The first one is a system of equations, and the second one involves simplifying an expression and then plugging in values for x and y. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with problem (1): Solve the system of equations:[begin{cases}2x - y = -4 4x - 5y = -23end{cases}]Okay, so I need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. I remember that there are a couple of methods to solve systems of equations: substitution and elimination. Let me see which one would be easier here.Looking at the first equation, 2x - y = -4, it seems straightforward to solve for one of the variables. Maybe I can solve for y in terms of x. Let's try that.From the first equation:2x - y = -4  Subtract 2x from both sides:  -y = -4 - 2x  Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for y:  y = 4 + 2xAlright, so y is expressed in terms of x. Now I can substitute this expression into the second equation to find x.The second equation is 4x - 5y = -23. Let's plug in y = 4 + 2x into this.So, substituting:4x - 5*(4 + 2x) = -23Let me compute that step by step. First, expand the terms inside the parentheses:4x - 5*4 - 5*2x = -23  4x - 20 - 10x = -23Now, combine like terms. 4x - 10x is -6x, so:-6x - 20 = -23Next, I'll solve for x. Let's add 20 to both sides:-6x = -23 + 20  -6x = -3Now, divide both sides by -6:x = (-3)/(-6)  x = 1/2Okay, so x is 1/2. Now, let's find y using the expression we had earlier: y = 4 + 2x.Substitute x = 1/2 into that:y = 4 + 2*(1/2)  y = 4 + 1  y = 5So, the solution is x = 1/2 and y = 5. Let me double-check these values in both equations to make sure.First equation: 2x - y = -4  Plugging in x = 1/2 and y = 5:  2*(1/2) - 5 = 1 - 5 = -4  Which matches the equation.Second equation: 4x - 5y = -23  Plugging in x = 1/2 and y = 5:  4*(1/2) - 5*5 = 2 - 25 = -23  Which also matches.Great, so that seems correct.Moving on to problem (2): Simplify first, then find the value of the expression:[(x - 3y)^2 - (2x + y)(y - 2x)]Given that x = 2 and y = -1.Hmm, okay. The problem says to simplify first, then substitute the values. So, I need to expand and simplify the expression before plugging in the numbers. That makes sense because sometimes simplifying can make the calculation easier or reveal if there are any errors.Let me write down the expression:[(x - 3y)^2 - (2x + y)(y - 2x)]First, I'll expand each part separately.Starting with the first term: (x - 3y)^2.I know that (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2, so applying that here:(x - 3y)^2 = x^2 - 2*x*(3y) + (3y)^2  = x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2Okay, that's the first part.Now, the second term is (2x + y)(y - 2x). Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares or something similar. Let me check.Wait, (2x + y)(y - 2x) can be rewritten as (y + 2x)(y - 2x), which is a difference of squares. So, that would be y^2 - (2x)^2.Let me confirm that:(y + 2x)(y - 2x) = y^2 - (2x)^2 = y^2 - 4x^2Yes, that's correct. So, the second term simplifies to y^2 - 4x^2.So, putting it all together, the original expression becomes:First term - Second term = (x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2) - (y^2 - 4x^2)Now, distribute the negative sign to the second term:= x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2 - y^2 + 4x^2Combine like terms:x^2 + 4x^2 = 5x^2  9y^2 - y^2 = 8y^2  So, the expression simplifies to:5x^2 - 6xy + 8y^2Alright, so that's the simplified form. Now, let's plug in x = 2 and y = -1.Compute each term step by step.First, compute 5x^2:  5*(2)^2 = 5*4 = 20Next, compute -6xy:  -6*(2)*(-1) = -6*(-2) = 12Then, compute 8y^2:  8*(-1)^2 = 8*1 = 8Now, add them all together:20 + 12 + 8 = 40Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations.Compute 5x^2:  5*(2)^2 = 5*4 = 20. Correct.Compute -6xy:  -6*(2)*(-1) = (-12)*(-1) = 12. Correct.Compute 8y^2:  8*(-1)^2 = 8*1 = 8. Correct.Adding them: 20 + 12 is 32, plus 8 is 40. So, yes, 40 is the result.Alternatively, just to make sure, I can compute the original expression without simplifying, but that might take longer. Let me try that as a check.Original expression: (x - 3y)^2 - (2x + y)(y - 2x)Plug in x = 2 and y = -1.First, compute (x - 3y)^2:x = 2, y = -1  x - 3y = 2 - 3*(-1) = 2 + 3 = 5  So, (5)^2 = 25Next, compute (2x + y)(y - 2x):2x + y = 2*2 + (-1) = 4 - 1 = 3  y - 2x = (-1) - 2*2 = -1 - 4 = -5  Multiply them: 3*(-5) = -15Now, subtract the second result from the first:25 - (-15) = 25 + 15 = 40Same result. So, that confirms that the simplified expression gives the correct value when evaluated.Therefore, the value of the expression is 40.So, summarizing my results:Problem (1): x = 1/2, y = 5  Problem (2): The value is 40.**Final Answer**(1) The solution is boxed{x = dfrac{1}{2}} and boxed{y = 5}.(2) The value of the expression is boxed{40}."},{"question":"Five people each take a bucket to the tap to wait for water. If the time it takes for the tap to fill each person's bucket is 4 minutes, 8 minutes, 6 minutes, 10 minutes, and 5 minutes respectively, the minimum total waiting time for all the buckets to be filled is ___ minutes.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where five people are waiting to fill their buckets at a tap. Each person's bucket takes a different amount of time to fill: 4 minutes, 8 minutes, 6 minutes, 10 minutes, and 5 minutes. The question is asking for the minimum total waiting time for all the buckets to be filled. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out the order in which they should fill their buckets to minimize the total waiting time.Let me think about this. I remember something about scheduling jobs to minimize waiting time. I think it's related to the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm. Is that right? So, the idea is to process the shortest jobs first because that reduces the waiting time for subsequent jobs. Let me verify that.If we process the shortest jobs first, the waiting time for each subsequent job is minimized because the earlier jobs take less time, so the queue doesn't get backed up. That makes sense. So, applying SJF here, I should sort the filling times in ascending order and then calculate the waiting time for each person.Let me write down the times: 4, 8, 6, 10, 5. Sorting them in ascending order gives: 4, 5, 6, 8, 10. Okay, so the order should be 4 minutes, then 5, then 6, then 8, then 10.Now, to calculate the total waiting time, I need to consider the waiting time for each person. The waiting time for each person is the sum of the times of all the previous people. So, the first person only waits for their own time, the second person waits for the first person's time plus their own, and so on.Wait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The total waiting time is the sum of the waiting times for each person. The waiting time for each person is the time they spend waiting before their bucket starts being filled. So, for the first person, their waiting time is 0 because they start immediately. The second person's waiting time is the time it took for the first person to fill their bucket. The third person's waiting time is the sum of the first and second person's filling times, and so on.So, the total waiting time is the sum of all these individual waiting times. Let me write this down step by step.1. First person: 4 minutes. Their waiting time is 0. Total waiting time so far: 0.2. Second person: 5 minutes. Their waiting time is 4 minutes (time taken by the first person). Total waiting time so far: 0 + 4 = 4.3. Third person: 6 minutes. Their waiting time is 4 + 5 = 9 minutes. Total waiting time so far: 4 + 9 = 13.4. Fourth person: 8 minutes. Their waiting time is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 minutes. Total waiting time so far: 13 + 15 = 28.5. Fifth person: 10 minutes. Their waiting time is 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 23 minutes. Total waiting time so far: 28 + 23 = 51.So, adding all these up: 0 + 4 + 9 + 15 + 23 = 51 minutes. Is that the minimum total waiting time?Wait a second, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in adding or in the order.Let me list out the order again: 4, 5, 6, 8, 10.Calculating the cumulative waiting times:- After first person: 4 minutes. Total waiting time contributed: 0 (since only the first person, no one is waiting).- After second person: 4 + 5 = 9 minutes. The second person waited 4 minutes. So total waiting time is 4.- After third person: 9 + 6 = 15 minutes. The third person waited 9 minutes. Total waiting time: 4 + 9 = 13.- After fourth person: 15 + 8 = 23 minutes. The fourth person waited 15 minutes. Total waiting time: 13 + 15 = 28.- After fifth person: 23 + 10 = 33 minutes. The fifth person waited 23 minutes. Total waiting time: 28 + 23 = 51.Yes, that seems consistent. So, the total waiting time is 51 minutes.But wait, let me consider if there's another order that could result in a lower total waiting time. Maybe if I switch some of the later tasks?For example, if I put the 10-minute task earlier, would that affect the total waiting time? Let's see.Suppose the order is 4, 5, 6, 10, 8.Calculating the waiting times:- First person: 4, waiting time 0. Total: 0.- Second person: 5, waiting time 4. Total: 4.- Third person: 6, waiting time 4 + 5 = 9. Total: 4 + 9 = 13.- Fourth person: 10, waiting time 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. Total: 13 + 15 = 28.- Fifth person: 8, waiting time 4 + 5 + 6 + 10 = 25. Total: 28 + 25 = 53.Hmm, that's actually higher. So, moving the 10-minute task earlier increased the total waiting time because the last person had to wait longer.What if I try another order, like 4, 5, 8, 6, 10?Calculating waiting times:- First: 4, total waiting time 0.- Second: 5, waiting 4. Total: 4.- Third: 8, waiting 4 + 5 = 9. Total: 4 + 9 = 13.- Fourth: 6, waiting 4 + 5 + 8 = 17. Total: 13 + 17 = 30.- Fifth: 10, waiting 4 + 5 + 8 + 6 = 23. Total: 30 + 23 = 53.Still higher. Hmm.What if I do 4, 6, 5, 8, 10?Wait, let's see:- First: 4, total 0.- Second: 6, waiting 4. Total: 4.- Third: 5, waiting 4 + 6 = 10. Total: 4 + 10 = 14.- Fourth: 8, waiting 4 + 6 + 5 = 15. Total: 14 + 15 = 29.- Fifth: 10, waiting 4 + 6 + 5 + 8 = 23. Total: 29 + 23 = 52.Still higher than 51.Wait, so maybe 51 is indeed the minimum. Let me think if there's another way.Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total waiting time as the sum of the completion times minus the sum of the processing times. Wait, is that a formula?Yes, actually, in scheduling theory, the total waiting time can be calculated as the sum of the completion times minus the sum of the processing times. So, if I can compute the completion times for each job, then subtract the total processing time, I can get the total waiting time.Let me try that.First, the processing times are 4, 5, 6, 8, 10.Sum of processing times: 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 33 minutes.Now, the completion times for each job in the order 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 are:- First job: 4- Second job: 4 + 5 = 9- Third job: 9 + 6 = 15- Fourth job: 15 + 8 = 23- Fifth job: 23 + 10 = 33So, the sum of completion times is 4 + 9 + 15 + 23 + 33.Calculating that: 4 + 9 = 13; 13 + 15 = 28; 28 + 23 = 51; 51 + 33 = 84.So, sum of completion times is 84.Total waiting time is sum of completion times minus sum of processing times: 84 - 33 = 51 minutes.Yes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, that seems to confirm that 51 is indeed the minimum total waiting time.Therefore, I think the answer is 51 minutes.**Final Answer**The minimum total waiting time for all the buckets to be filled is boxed{51} minutes."},{"question":"There are 10 horses, named Horse 1, Horse 2, ldots, Horse 10. They get their names from how many minutes it takes them to run one lap around a circular race track: Horse k runs one lap in exactly k minutes.

The least time S > 0, in minutes, at which all 10 horses will again simultaneously be at the starting point is S = 2520.

What is the sum of the digits of  T?textbf{(A)} 2qquadtextbf{(B)} 3qquadtextbf{(C)} 4qquadtextbf{(D)} 5qquadtextbf{(E)} 6","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about horses racing around a circular track. There are 10 horses, each named Horse 1 through Horse 10. Horse k takes exactly k minutes to complete one lap. They all start at the same point and time, which is time 0. The problem says that the least time S where all 10 horses meet again is 2520 minutes, which I think is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 1 through 10. That makes sense because LCM gives the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the given numbers, so that's when all horses would have completed an integer number of laps and returned to the starting point.But now, the question is about finding the least time T where at least 5 of the horses are back at the starting point. Hmm, okay. So instead of needing all 10 horses to meet, we just need at least 5 of them. That should be a smaller time than 2520, right? So, I need to figure out the smallest T such that T is a multiple of the lap times of at least 5 horses.Let me think about how to approach this. Since each horse has a lap time equal to its number, Horse 1 takes 1 minute per lap, Horse 2 takes 2 minutes, and so on up to Horse 10 taking 10 minutes. So, if I want multiple horses to be at the starting point at the same time, T must be a common multiple of their lap times. The smallest such T would be the LCM of their lap times.Therefore, to find the minimal T where at least 5 horses meet, I need to find a set of 5 horses whose lap times have the smallest possible LCM. So, the problem reduces to selecting 5 horses from the 10 such that the LCM of their lap times is as small as possible.Okay, so I need to choose 5 horses with lap times that have the smallest LCM. How can I do that? Well, intuitively, choosing horses with smaller lap times might lead to a smaller LCM, but it's not just about the smallest numbers because the LCM depends on the factors of each number.For example, if I choose Horse 1, Horse 2, Horse 3, Horse 4, and Horse 6, their LCM is 12, because 12 is the smallest number divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. But if I include Horse 5 instead of Horse 6, the LCM becomes LCM(1,2,3,4,5) which is 60, which is much larger. So, including numbers with prime factors not shared by others can significantly increase the LCM.Therefore, it's better to choose numbers that share as many common factors as possible. So, perhaps choosing numbers that are all even? Let's see. If I choose Horse 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, their LCM would be LCM(2,4,6,8,10). Let's compute that.First, factor each number:- 2 = 2- 4 = 2²- 6 = 2×3- 8 = 2³- 10 = 2×5So, the LCM would be the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So, primes are 2, 3, 5. The highest power of 2 is 2³ (from 8), the highest power of 3 is 3¹ (from 6), and the highest power of 5 is 5¹ (from 10). So, LCM = 8×3×5 = 120.Hmm, 120 minutes. Is that the smallest possible? Let's see if we can do better by choosing a different set of 5 horses.What if we include Horse 1? Because Horse 1 has a lap time of 1 minute, which divides into every other number. So, if we include Horse 1, the LCM of the set will just be the LCM of the other four horses. So, for example, if we take Horse 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, the LCM is 12, as I thought earlier. That's much smaller than 120.Wait, but 12 is smaller. So, why not include Horse 1? Because including Horse 1 allows us to have a smaller LCM. So, maybe the minimal T is 12? But wait, let's check if 12 is indeed a time when at least 5 horses are at the starting point.At T=12 minutes, which horses would be back? Let's see:- Horse 1: 12 /1 = 12 laps, so yes.- Horse 2: 12 /2 = 6 laps, yes.- Horse 3: 12 /3 = 4 laps, yes.- Horse 4: 12 /4 = 3 laps, yes.- Horse 6: 12 /6 = 2 laps, yes.- Horse 12: But we don't have Horse 12. So, only Horses 1,2,3,4,6 would be back. That's 5 horses. So, T=12 is a candidate.But wait, is there a smaller T where at least 5 horses meet? Let's check.What about T=6? Let's see which horses would be back:- Horse 1: 6/1=6 laps, yes.- Horse 2: 6/2=3 laps, yes.- Horse 3: 6/3=2 laps, yes.- Horse 6: 6/6=1 lap, yes.- Horse 4: 6/4=1.5 laps, not an integer, so no.- Horse 5: 6/5=1.2 laps, no.- Horse 7: 6/7≈0.857 laps, no.- Similarly, Horses 8,9,10 would not have completed integer laps.So, at T=6, only Horses 1,2,3,6 are back. That's 4 horses, which is less than 5. So, T=6 is too small.What about T=8?- Horse 1: 8/1=8, yes.- Horse 2: 8/2=4, yes.- Horse 4: 8/4=2, yes.- Horse 8: 8/8=1, yes.- Horse 3: 8/3≈2.666, no.- Horse 5: 8/5=1.6, no.- Horse 6: 8/6≈1.333, no.- Horse 7: 8/7≈1.142, no.- Horse 9: 8/9≈0.888, no.- Horse 10: 8/10=0.8, no.So, at T=8, only Horses 1,2,4,8 are back. That's 4 horses again. Still less than 5.What about T=10?- Horse 1: 10/1=10, yes.- Horse 2: 10/2=5, yes.- Horse 5: 10/5=2, yes.- Horse 10: 10/10=1, yes.- Horse 4: 10/4=2.5, no.- Horse 3: 10/3≈3.333, no.- Horse 6: 10/6≈1.666, no.- Horse 7: 10/7≈1.428, no.- Horse 8: 10/8=1.25, no.- Horse 9: 10/9≈1.111, no.So, at T=10, Horses 1,2,5,10 are back. That's 4 horses. Still not enough.How about T=12? As I thought earlier, Horses 1,2,3,4,6 are back. That's 5 horses. So, T=12 is a candidate.Is there a T smaller than 12 where at least 5 horses meet? Let's check T=12 is the first one.Wait, what about T=9?- Horse 1: 9/1=9, yes.- Horse 3: 9/3=3, yes.- Horse 9: 9/9=1, yes.- Horse 2: 9/2=4.5, no.- Horse 4: 9/4=2.25, no.- Horse 5: 9/5=1.8, no.- Horse 6: 9/6=1.5, no.- Horse 7: 9/7≈1.285, no.- Horse 8: 9/8=1.125, no.- Horse 10: 9/10=0.9, no.So, only Horses 1,3,9 are back. That's 3 horses. Not enough.What about T=12 is indeed the first time where 5 horses meet. But let me check another set of horses. Maybe a different combination of 5 horses can have a smaller LCM.For example, instead of Horses 1,2,3,4,6, what if I choose Horses 1,2,4,5,10? Let's compute their LCM.Compute LCM(1,2,4,5,10). The prime factors are:- 1: 1- 2: 2- 4: 2²- 5: 5- 10: 2×5So, the LCM is 2²×5=20. So, T=20. But 20 is larger than 12, so 12 is still better.What about choosing Horses 1,2,3,6, something else? Wait, if I include Horse 1,2,3,6, and maybe Horse 12, but we don't have Horse 12.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4,6 as before, which gives LCM 12.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4,12, but again, we don't have Horse 12.Wait, maybe another combination. Let's try Horses 1,2,3,4, something else. Wait, but adding Horse 5 would make the LCM 60, which is worse.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not available. So, perhaps 1,2,3,4,6 is the best.Alternatively, maybe Horses 2,4,6,8,10. As I computed earlier, their LCM is 120, which is worse than 12.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,4,5,10, which is LCM 20.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,6, something else. Wait, if I take Horses 1,2,3,6, and Horse 12, but again, no.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not available.Wait, maybe another approach. Let's list all possible combinations of 5 horses and compute their LCMs, but that's too time-consuming.Alternatively, think about the minimal LCMs. Since Horse 1 is special because it divides into everything, including Horse 1 in the set allows the LCM to be the LCM of the other four horses. So, to minimize the LCM, we should include Horse 1 and then choose four other horses with the smallest possible LCM.So, the problem reduces to choosing four horses from 2 to 10 such that their LCM is as small as possible.So, what's the minimal LCM of four numbers from 2 to 10?Well, let's see. The minimal LCM would be achieved by choosing numbers that are as small as possible and share common factors.For example, choosing 2,3,4,6. Their LCM is 12. Alternatively, choosing 2,4,6,8. Their LCM is 24. Choosing 2,3,4,6 is better.Alternatively, choosing 2,3,4, Horse 12, but we don't have that.Alternatively, 2,3,4,6 is the best so far with LCM 12.Alternatively, 2,3,4, Horse 12, but again, no.Wait, so if we include Horse 1,2,3,4,6, the LCM is 12, which is the minimal so far.Is there a way to get a lower LCM? Let's see. If we choose Horses 1,2,3,4,6, LCM is 12.If we try another set, say Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12, but we don't have Horse 12.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not there.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not available.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not there.Wait, maybe another combination. Let's try Horses 1,2,4,5,10. Their LCM is 20, which is higher than 12.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,6, something else. Wait, if I take Horses 1,2,3,6, and Horse 12, but again, no.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,6, and Horse 9. Let's compute LCM(1,2,3,6,9). The LCM is 18. Because 9 is 3², so LCM is 2×3²=18. So, T=18. But 18 is larger than 12, so 12 is still better.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4,6 is better.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not available.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not there.Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider that the minimal LCM for four numbers from 2 to 10 is 12, achieved by 2,3,4,6. So, adding Horse 1, the total LCM is still 12. So, that's the minimal.Therefore, T=12 is the minimal time where at least 5 horses meet. So, the sum of the digits of T is 1 + 2 = 3.Wait, but let me double-check. Is there a T less than 12 where at least 5 horses meet?We saw that at T=6, only 4 horses meet. At T=8, only 4. At T=10, only 4. At T=12, 5 horses meet. So, 12 is indeed the minimal T.Therefore, the answer is 1 + 2 = 3, which is option B.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Is there a way to get 5 horses meeting at a time less than 12? For example, maybe a different combination of horses.Suppose I choose Horses 1,2,4,5,10. Their LCM is 20, which is higher than 12.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,6,9. Their LCM is 18, which is higher.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,4,6,8. Their LCM is 24, which is higher.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4,6 is 12.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not available.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not there.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, Horse 12 is not available.Wait, another thought. What if I choose Horses 1,2,3,4, and 12? But we don't have Horse 12.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, and 12 is not available.Wait, perhaps another combination. Let's think about Horses 1,2,3,4, and 12 is not available.Alternatively, Horses 1,2,3,4, and 12 is not there.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since 12 is the minimal LCM for 5 horses, and we can't get a smaller LCM with 5 horses, then 12 is indeed the answer.Therefore, the sum of the digits of T is 1 + 2 = 3, which is option B."},{"question":"A regular triangle is inscribed in a circle with a diameter of sqrt{12}. Another regular triangle is constructed on its height as a side, and a new circle is inscribed in this triangle. Find the radius of this circle.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a regular triangle is inscribed in a circle with a diameter of √12. Then, another regular triangle is constructed on its height as a side, and a new circle is inscribed in this triangle. I need to find the radius of this new circle. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the problem. A regular triangle, which is an equilateral triangle, inscribed in a circle. The circle has a diameter of √12, so its radius is half of that, which is √12 / 2. Let me compute that: √12 is equal to 2√3, so dividing by 2 gives √3. So the radius of the first circle is √3.Now, since the triangle is regular and inscribed in the circle, all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. In an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, the radius of the circle is also known as the circumradius of the triangle. I remember that the formula for the circumradius (R) of an equilateral triangle with side length (a) is R = a / √3. So, if I can find the side length of the first triangle, I can relate it to the radius.Wait, but in this case, the radius is given as √3, so I can solve for the side length. Let me write that down:R = a / √3  √3 = a / √3  Multiplying both sides by √3:  √3 * √3 = a  Which simplifies to:  3 = aSo, the side length of the first equilateral triangle is 3 units.Now, the problem says another regular triangle is constructed on its height as a side. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the height of the first triangle and then use that height as the side length of the second triangle.Let me recall that the height (h) of an equilateral triangle with side length (a) is given by h = (√3 / 2) * a. So, plugging in a = 3:h = (√3 / 2) * 3  h = (3√3) / 2So, the height of the first triangle is (3√3)/2. This height is going to be the side length of the second equilateral triangle. So, the side length of the second triangle is (3√3)/2.Now, I need to find the radius of the circle inscribed in this second triangle. The radius of the inscribed circle (r) in an equilateral triangle is given by r = (a * √3) / 6, where a is the side length. Let me confirm that formula: yes, for an equilateral triangle, the inradius is (a√3)/6.So, plugging in the side length of the second triangle, which is (3√3)/2:r = [(3√3)/2 * √3] / 6  Let me compute the numerator first:  (3√3)/2 * √3 = (3 * 3)/2 = 9/2  So, r = (9/2) / 6  Which is equal to (9/2) * (1/6) = 9/12 = 3/4Wait, so the radius of the inscribed circle in the second triangle is 3/4. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, radius of the first circle: √12 / 2 = √3. Correct. Then, side length of the first triangle: R = a / √3 => a = R * √3 = √3 * √3 = 3. Correct.Height of the first triangle: (√3 / 2) * 3 = (3√3)/2. Correct.Then, side length of the second triangle is (3√3)/2. Then, inradius of the second triangle: (a√3)/6. Plugging in a = (3√3)/2:r = [(3√3)/2 * √3] / 6  Multiply √3 and √3: 3  So, numerator: (3√3)/2 * √3 = (3 * 3)/2 = 9/2  Then, 9/2 divided by 6 is 9/12, which simplifies to 3/4. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using coordinate geometry or trigonometry to verify.Let me think about the first triangle. It's inscribed in a circle with radius √3. The side length is 3, as we found. The height is (3√3)/2, which is approximately 2.598.Now, constructing another equilateral triangle with this height as its side. So, the side length is (3√3)/2, which is approximately 2.598. Then, the inradius of this triangle is (a√3)/6, which is (2.598 * 1.732)/6. Let me compute that:2.598 * 1.732 ≈ 4.499  Divide by 6: ≈ 0.7498, which is approximately 3/4 (0.75). So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can use the relationship between the inradius and the circumradius in an equilateral triangle. Wait, in an equilateral triangle, the inradius is half the circumradius. Is that correct?Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me recall: in an equilateral triangle, the centroid, circumcenter, and inradius coincide. The distance from the center to a vertex is the circumradius (R), and the distance from the center to a side is the inradius (r). The relationship between them is r = R / 2. Wait, is that true?Wait, let me think. In an equilateral triangle, the centroid divides the height in a 2:1 ratio. So, the centroid is located at 2/3 of the height from the base. So, if the height is h, then the inradius is 1/3 of the height, and the circumradius is 2/3 of the height.Wait, hold on. Let me clarify. The centroid is at 2/3 of the height from the base, so that point is the circumradius. The inradius is the distance from the centroid to the base, which is 1/3 of the height.Wait, so if the height is h, then:Circumradius (R) = (2/3)h  Inradius (r) = (1/3)hBut in our case, for the second triangle, we have the side length a = (3√3)/2, so let's compute its height h':h' = (√3 / 2) * a = (√3 / 2) * (3√3)/2 = (3 * 3)/4 = 9/4So, the height of the second triangle is 9/4. Then, the inradius would be (1/3)h' = (1/3)*(9/4) = 3/4. That's consistent with what I found earlier.Alternatively, using the formula r = (a√3)/6, plugging in a = (3√3)/2:r = [(3√3)/2 * √3]/6 = (9/2)/6 = 3/4. Same result.So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.Wait, just to make sure, let me recap:1. First circle has diameter √12, so radius √3.2. Regular triangle inscribed in this circle has side length a = 3 (since R = a / √3).3. Height of this triangle is (3√3)/2.4. Construct another regular triangle with side length equal to this height, so a' = (3√3)/2.5. The inradius of this second triangle is (a'√3)/6 = 3/4.Yes, that all adds up. So, the radius of the inscribed circle in the second triangle is 3/4.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods of calculating the inradius gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 3/4 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The radius of the inscribed circle is boxed{dfrac{3}{4}}."},{"question":"Write the decomposition of vector x in terms of vectors p, q, r:x={11 ; 5 ;-3}p={1 ; 0 ; 2}q={-1 ; 0 ; 1}r={2 ; 5 ;-3}","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to decompose vector x in terms of vectors p, q, and r. Let me write down what each vector is:x = {11; 5; -3}p = {1; 0; 2}q = {-1; 0; 1}r = {2; 5; -3}Okay, so decomposition means expressing x as a linear combination of p, q, and r. That is, I need to find scalars a, b, c such that:x = a*p + b*q + c*rSo, in component form, that would be:11 = a*1 + b*(-1) + c*25 = a*0 + b*0 + c*5-3 = a*2 + b*1 + c*(-3)Hmm, so I have a system of three equations with three unknowns.

Now, let's plug c = 1 into equations 1 and 3.Equation 1 becomes: 11 = a - b + 2*1 => 11 = a - b + 2 => a - b = 11 - 2 => a - b = 9Equation 3 becomes: -3 = 2a + b - 3*1 => -3 = 2a + b - 3 => 2a + b = -3 + 3 => 2a + b = 0So now, I have two equations:4) a - b = 95) 2a + b = 0Let me solve these two equations for a and b.From equation 4: a = b + 9Plug this into equation 5:2*(b + 9) + b = 0 => 2b + 18 + b = 0 => 3b + 18 = 0 => 3b = -18 => b = -6Now, substitute b = -6 into equation 4:a - (-6) = 9 => a + 6 = 9 => a = 3So, a = 3, b = -6, c = 1Let me double-check these values by plugging them back into the original equations.Equation 1: 11 = 3 - (-6) + 2*1 = 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 ✔️Equation 2: 5 = 5*1 = 5 ✔️Equation 3: -3 = 2*3 + (-6) - 3*1 = 6 - 6 - 3 = -3 ✔️All equations check out.

Each person is on duty for one day, with both members A and B not being scheduled on May 1st and 2nd. The total number of different scheduling methods is _______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to arrange 7 staff members to be on duty from May 1st to May 7th. Each person works one day, and there are some constraints: members A and B can't be scheduled on May 1st and 2nd. I need to find the total number of different scheduling methods. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, without any constraints, the number of ways to schedule 7 people over 7 days would simply be 7 factorial, which is 7! = 5040. That's because for each day, you choose one person out of the remaining ones. So, for the first day, you have 7 choices, the second day 6, and so on until the seventh day where you have only 1 choice left.But here, we have constraints: A and B can't be on duty on May 1st and 2nd. So, I need to adjust the total number of permutations to account for these restrictions. Let me think about how to approach this.One way to handle such problems is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. But maybe it's simpler to consider the problem by breaking it into parts: first, handle the days where A and B can't be scheduled, and then handle the rest.So, May 1st and May 2nd are the restricted days. On these two days, neither A nor B can be on duty. That means, for these two days, we have to choose from the remaining 5 staff members (since there are 7 in total, minus A and B). Let me note that down:- May 1st: 5 possible staff members (excluding A and B)- May 2nd: 5 possible staff members (excluding A and B)Wait, but hold on, once we assign someone to May 1st, that person can't be assigned to May 2nd, right? Because each person is on duty for only one day. So, actually, for May 1st, we have 5 choices, and for May 2nd, we have 4 choices (since one person has already been assigned to May 1st). So, the number of ways to assign May 1st and May 2nd is 5 * 4 = 20.Okay, so that's 20 ways for the first two days. Now, for the remaining days: May 3rd to May 7th, which is 5 days. On these days, all 7 staff members are available, except for the two who have already been assigned to May 1st and May 2nd. So, we have 5 staff members left, but wait, no: actually, we've only assigned two people so far, so 7 - 2 = 5 people remain. But wait, no, hold on: the total number of staff is 7, each assigned to one day. So, after assigning May 1st and May 2nd, we have 5 days left and 5 people left.Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. We have 7 days and 7 people. On May 1st and 2nd, we assigned two people, so for the remaining 5 days (May 3rd to May 7th), we have 5 people left. So, the number of ways to assign the remaining 5 days is 5! = 120.Therefore, the total number of ways is the number of ways to assign May 1st and 2nd multiplied by the number of ways to assign the remaining days. So, 20 * 120 = 2400.Wait, but hold on a second. Is that all? Let me verify.Alternatively, another way to approach this is to consider the total number of permutations without restrictions, which is 7! = 5040, and then subtract the number of permutations where A or B is scheduled on May 1st or 2nd. But that might be more complicated because we have overlapping cases where both A and B are scheduled on those days, and we have to use inclusion-exclusion. Maybe my initial approach was better.Wait, let me try this alternative method to see if I get the same result.Total permutations: 7! = 5040.Now, let's calculate the number of invalid permutations where A or B is on May 1st or 2nd.First, calculate the number of permutations where A is on May 1st. If A is fixed on May 1st, then the remaining 6 days can be assigned to the other 6 staff members, so that's 6! = 720.Similarly, the number of permutations where A is on May 2nd is also 6! = 720.Similarly, the number of permutations where B is on May 1st is 6! = 720, and the same for B on May 2nd: 6! = 720.So, adding these up, we have 4 * 720 = 2880.But wait, this counts some permutations twice. Specifically, the permutations where both A and B are on May 1st and 2nd. So, we need to subtract those cases.How many permutations have both A on May 1st and B on May 2nd? That would fix A and B on those two days, and the remaining 5 days can be assigned to the other 5 staff members, so that's 5! = 120.Similarly, the permutations where A is on May 2nd and B is on May 1st would also be 5! = 120.So, total overlapping cases are 2 * 120 = 240.Therefore, using inclusion-exclusion, the number of invalid permutations is 2880 - 240 = 2640.Therefore, the number of valid permutations is total permutations minus invalid permutations: 5040 - 2640 = 2400.Okay, so that matches the result from my initial approach. So, that gives me more confidence that 2400 is the correct answer.But let me think again to make sure I didn't miss anything.In the first approach, I considered that for May 1st and 2nd, we have 5 choices each day, but since assignments are without replacement, it's 5 * 4 = 20. Then, for the remaining 5 days, we have 5 people left, so 5! = 120. So, 20 * 120 = 2400.In the second approach, using inclusion-exclusion, I subtracted the invalid permutations from the total, which also gave me 2400.So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.Alternatively, another way to think about it is:We have two restricted days (May 1st and 2nd) where A and B cannot be assigned. So, for these two days, we have to choose from the remaining 5 staff members. The number of ways to assign these two days is the number of permutations of 5 staff members taken 2 at a time, which is P(5,2) = 5 * 4 = 20.Then, for the remaining 5 days, we have 5 staff members left (including A and B), and we need to assign each of them to a day. That's 5! = 120.Multiplying these together, 20 * 120 = 2400.Yes, that makes sense.Wait, another thought: could there be an issue with overcounting or undercounting? For example, if A or B are assigned to days beyond May 2nd, does that affect anything? But in this case, the only restrictions are on May 1st and 2nd, so A and B can be assigned to any of the other days without any problem. So, once we've assigned May 1st and 2nd with the other 5 staff members, the rest can be assigned freely, including A and B.So, yes, that approach is correct.Alternatively, if I think in terms of permutations with restricted positions, this is similar to derangements but with specific restrictions on certain positions.But in this case, it's simpler because only two positions (May 1st and 2nd) have restrictions, and the rest are free.So, to summarize:- For May 1st and 2nd: 5 choices for May 1st, 4 choices for May 2nd (since one person is already assigned to May 1st). So, 5 * 4 = 20.- For the remaining 5 days: 5! = 120.Total permutations: 20 * 120 = 2400.Yes, that seems solid.I think I've considered it from multiple angles and each time arrived at the same answer. So, I feel confident that 2400 is the correct number of different scheduling methods.**Final Answer**The total number of different scheduling methods is boxed{2400}."},{"question":"Tina made a large pan of brownies and cut it into 24 pieces.

To minimize the number of leftover pipes, the number of remaining pipes is ________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 1200 identical steel pipes that need to be stacked into a triangular pile. The goal is to minimize the number of leftover pipes, and I need to figure out how many pipes will be left over. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that a triangular pile of pipes means that each layer is a triangle number. Triangle numbers are numbers that can form an equilateral triangle. The formula for the nth triangle number is T_n = n(n + 1)/2. So, if I can find the largest triangle number that is less than or equal to 1200, the difference between 1200 and that triangle number will be the number of leftover pipes.Alright, so I need to find the largest integer n such that T_n = n(n + 1)/2 ≤ 1200. Let me write that down:n(n + 1)/2 ≤ 1200I can rearrange this inequality to solve for n. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:n(n + 1) ≤ 2400So, n² + n - 2400 ≤ 0This is a quadratic inequality. To find the critical points, I can solve the equation n² + n - 2400 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, n = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a = 1, b = 1, c = -2400.Calculating the discriminant:D = b² - 4ac = 1 + 9600 = 9601Hmm, sqrt(9601) is... let me think. 98 squared is 9604, which is just 3 more than 9601. So sqrt(9601) is 98 - a little bit. Wait, actually, 98 squared is 9604, so 97 squared is 9409. Let me check 98^2: 98*98. 100*100 is 10000, minus 2*100 + 4 is 10000 - 200 + 4 = 9804. Wait, that's not right. Actually, 98^2 is (100 - 2)^2 = 10000 - 400 + 4 = 9604. So sqrt(9601) is 98 - 3/98 approximately? Wait, no, that's not the way. Wait, 98^2 is 9604, which is 3 more than 9601, so sqrt(9601) is 98 - something. But maybe it's a whole number? Let me check 97^2: 97*97 is 9409, which is less than 9601. 98^2 is 9604, which is 3 more. So sqrt(9601) is not a whole number. Wait, but 9601 is 98^2 - 3, so it's not a perfect square. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me double-check:D = b² - 4ac = 1 - 4*1*(-2400) = 1 + 9600 = 9601. Yeah, that's correct. So sqrt(9601) is indeed 98 - something, but since it's not a whole number, the roots of the quadratic equation will not be integers. Hmm, so n = [-1 ± sqrt(9601)]/2. Since n has to be positive, we'll take the positive root:n = [-1 + sqrt(9601)]/2 ≈ (-1 + 98)/2 ≈ 97/2 ≈ 48.5So n is approximately 48.5. Since n has to be an integer, we take the floor of 48.5, which is 48. So the largest integer n such that T_n ≤ 1200 is 48.Let me verify this. Calculating T_48:T_48 = 48*49/2 = (48*49)/2. 48*49 is... 48*50 is 2400, minus 48 is 2352. So 2352/2 is 1176. So T_48 is 1176.Then, T_49 would be 49*50/2 = 2450/2 = 1225. But 1225 is greater than 1200, so that's too big. So 48 is indeed the largest n where T_n is less than or equal to 1200.Therefore, the number of leftover pipes is 1200 - T_48 = 1200 - 1176 = 24.Wait, so is the answer 24? Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.Calculating T_48: 48*49/2. 48 divided by 2 is 24, so 24*49. 24*50 is 1200, minus 24 is 1176. Correct.1200 - 1176 is 24. So yes, 24 pipes would be leftover.But just to double-check, what if I tried n=48, which gives 1176, and n=49 gives 1225. 1225 is more than 1200, so we can't use n=49. So 48 is the maximum, leaving 24 pipes.Alternatively, is there a way to arrange the pipes into a triangular pile with a different configuration that might leave fewer pipes? Hmm, but triangular numbers are the standard way to stack things in a triangle. So I think 24 is the minimal number of leftover pipes.Wait, another thought: sometimes, people might consider different kinds of triangular numbers or maybe even tetrahedral numbers, but in this case, it's a triangular pile, so it's just layers of triangles. So each layer is a triangle number, but the total number is a tetrahedral number. Wait, hold on, is that the case?Wait, actually, no. If you're stacking pipes into a triangular pile, each layer is a triangle number, and the total number is the sum of triangle numbers, which is a tetrahedral number. So maybe I need to think in terms of tetrahedral numbers?Wait, hold on, let me clarify. If it's a triangular pile, does that mean a single triangle, or does it mean a 3D triangular pile, like a tetrahedron? Hmm, the problem says \\"stacked into a triangular pile,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. In some contexts, a triangular pile refers to a 2D triangle, but in others, it could refer to a 3D tetrahedron.Wait, let me think. If it's a 2D triangular pile, then the total number of pipes is a triangle number. If it's a 3D tetrahedral pile, then the total number is a tetrahedral number. So which one is it?The problem says \\"stacked into a triangular pile.\\" The term \\"triangular pile\\" is a bit ambiguous. In common usage, a triangular pile usually refers to a 2D arrangement, like a triangle lying flat. But sometimes, people might refer to a 3D tetrahedral pile as a triangular pile because each layer is a triangle.Wait, let me check the original problem statement: \\"There are 1200 identical steel pipes, which need to be stacked into a triangular pile. To minimize the number of leftover pipes, the number of remaining pipes is ______.\\"Hmm, it just says \\"triangular pile,\\" without specifying 2D or 3D. So perhaps I need to consider both possibilities.Wait, if it's a 2D triangular pile, then the number of pipes is a triangle number, which is n(n + 1)/2. If it's a 3D tetrahedral pile, the number is n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6.So, depending on the interpretation, the answer could be different. Hmm, this complicates things.Wait, let me see. If it's a 2D triangular pile, then the maximum number of pipes we can use is 1176, leaving 24 leftover. If it's a 3D tetrahedral pile, then we need to find the largest tetrahedral number less than or equal to 1200.So, let's explore both possibilities.First, 2D triangular pile: As calculated before, n=48, T_n=1176, leftover=24.Second, 3D tetrahedral pile: The formula is T_n = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. We need to find the largest n such that T_n ≤ 1200.So, let's solve for n in n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6 ≤ 1200.Multiply both sides by 6: n(n + 1)(n + 2) ≤ 7200.This is a cubic equation. Let's approximate n.We can estimate n by taking cube root of 7200. Cube root of 7200 is approximately 19.3, since 19^3=6859 and 20^3=8000.So, let's try n=19:T_19 = 19*20*21/6 = (19*20*21)/6. 20/6 is 10/3, so 19*(10/3)*21 = 19*(210/3) = 19*70 = 1330. Wait, that's more than 1200.Wait, let me calculate that again:19*20=380, 380*21=7980, 7980/6=1330. Yes, that's correct. So T_19=1330, which is more than 1200.So, try n=18:T_18=18*19*20/6. 18/6=3, so 3*19*20=3*380=1140. So T_18=1140.Then, T_19=1330, which is too big. So the largest tetrahedral number less than or equal to 1200 is 1140, leaving 1200 - 1140 = 60 pipes leftover.Wait, so if it's a 3D tetrahedral pile, the leftover would be 60, which is more than the 2D case of 24.But the problem says \\"to minimize the number of leftover pipes,\\" so between 24 and 60, 24 is smaller. So, if the problem allows for either 2D or 3D, then the minimal leftover is 24.But wait, maybe the problem is specifically referring to a 2D triangular pile, given that it's called a \\"triangular pile\\" without specifying 3D. Also, in common terms, a triangular pile is usually 2D.But just to be thorough, let me check if 24 is indeed the minimal. Suppose someone interprets it as 3D, then 60 is the leftover, but since 24 is smaller, the minimal is 24.Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a different kind of triangular pile. Wait, another thought: sometimes, people stack pipes in a triangle where each layer is a triangle, but the number of pipes per layer decreases by one each time. So, the first layer has n pipes, the next has n-1, and so on, down to 1. So that's a triangle number.Wait, that's the same as the 2D case. So, in that case, the total number is a triangle number, which is n(n + 1)/2.Wait, but then in that case, the total number is the same as the 2D triangular pile.Wait, no, actually, in 3D, each layer is a triangle, but the number of layers is n, so the total is the sum of triangle numbers up to n, which is the tetrahedral number.So, if it's a 2D pile, it's just a single triangle with n(n + 1)/2 pipes. If it's a 3D pile, it's a tetrahedron with n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6 pipes.So, depending on the interpretation, the answer is different.But in the problem statement, it says \\"stacked into a triangular pile.\\" The term \\"triangular pile\\" can be ambiguous. In some contexts, it refers to a single triangle, which would be 2D, but in others, it might refer to a 3D pile where each layer is a triangle.Wait, let me check some references. In common usage, a triangular pile usually refers to a single layer, a 2D triangle. A 3D pile is often referred to as a tetrahedral pile or a pyramid.So, perhaps the problem is referring to a 2D triangular pile, meaning the total number is a triangle number. Therefore, the leftover pipes would be 24.But just to be safe, let me consider both interpretations.If it's 2D, the leftover is 24.If it's 3D, the leftover is 60.Since the problem says \\"to minimize the number of leftover pipes,\\" and 24 is smaller than 60, then 24 is the answer.Therefore, the number of remaining pipes is 24.But wait, hold on. Another thought: maybe the problem is referring to a triangular number in 2D, but perhaps the pile is built in such a way that each layer is a triangle, but the number of layers is variable. So, it's a 3D pile, but the number of layers can be adjusted to get as close as possible to 1200.Wait, but in that case, the total number is a tetrahedral number, which is n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6. So, we need to find the largest tetrahedral number less than or equal to 1200.Earlier, I found that T_18=1140 and T_19=1330. So, 1140 is the largest tetrahedral number less than 1200, leaving 60 leftover pipes.But if we can have a 2D triangular pile, which is just a single layer, then T_n=1176, which is closer to 1200, leaving only 24 pipes.So, depending on the interpretation, the answer is either 24 or 60.But the problem says \\"stacked into a triangular pile.\\" If it's a single layer, it's 2D, and the leftover is 24. If it's multiple layers forming a tetrahedron, the leftover is 60.But which interpretation is correct? Hmm.Wait, in the context of stacking pipes, a \\"triangular pile\\" is often a single layer, arranged in a triangle. If it's a 3D pile, it's usually called a tetrahedral pile or a pyramid.Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is a single triangular layer, so the leftover is 24.But just to make sure, let me think about the term \\"triangular pile.\\" In logistics and storage, a triangular pile typically refers to a single layer arranged in a triangle. If it's a 3D pile, they usually specify it as a tetrahedral or pyramid pile.Therefore, I think the answer is 24.But just to be thorough, let me check both.If it's 2D: n=48, T_n=1176, leftover=24.If it's 3D: n=18, T_n=1140, leftover=60.Since 24 is smaller, and the problem says \\"to minimize the number of leftover pipes,\\" the answer should be 24.Therefore, the number of remaining pipes is 24.**Final Answer**The number of remaining pipes is boxed{24}."},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (2, x) and overrightarrow{b} = (-1, 2), if overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b}, then the real number x = _____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given two vectors, vector a and vector b.

The dot product of two perpendicular vectors equals zero. So, if I can compute the dot product of vector a and vector b and set it equal to zero, I should be able to solve for x. That makes sense.Alright, let me recall how to compute the dot product of two vectors. If I have two vectors, say vector u = (u1, u2) and vector v = (v1, v2), their dot product is u1*v1 + u2*v2. So, it's just the sum of the products of their corresponding components. Got it.So, applying that to vectors a and b here. Vector a is (2, x) and vector b is (-1, 2). Let me write that out:Dot product = (2)*(-1) + (x)*(2)Simplify that:Dot product = -2 + 2xSince the vectors are perpendicular, this dot product should be zero. So, I can set up the equation:-2 + 2x = 0Now, I need to solve for x. Let me do that step by step.First, I can add 2 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:-2 + 2x + 2 = 0 + 2Simplifying that:2x = 2Now, to solve for x, I can divide both sides by 2:2x / 2 = 2 / 2Which simplifies to:x = 1So, the value of x is 1. Let me just double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the beginning: vectors a and b are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. The dot product is calculated as (2)*(-1) + (x)*(2) = -2 + 2x. Setting that equal to zero gives -2 + 2x = 0. Adding 2 to both sides: 2x = 2. Dividing both sides by 2: x = 1. Yep, that seems correct.Wait, just to be thorough, let me plug x = 1 back into the vectors and check if their dot product is indeed zero.Vector a becomes (2, 1) and vector b is (-1, 2). Calculating the dot product:2*(-1) + 1*2 = -2 + 2 = 0Perfect, that checks out. So, x = 1 is definitely the right answer.I think that's all there is to it. I didn't encounter any complications or alternative methods that I need to consider. The problem was straightforward once I remembered that perpendicular vectors have a dot product of zero. It's a good reminder of how important it is to remember these fundamental properties in vector algebra.Just to recap the steps in my mind:1. Recognize that perpendicular vectors have a dot product of zero.2. Write down the formula for the dot product of the given vectors.3. Substitute the known components into the formula.4. Set the resulting expression equal to zero and solve for the unknown variable x.5. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original vectors and confirming the dot product is zero.This systematic approach helps ensure that I don't skip any steps or make calculation errors. It's especially useful when dealing with problems that involve multiple steps or when I'm just starting out and want to make sure I understand each part of the process.I also remember that the dot product has a geometric interpretation. It's related to the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. Specifically, the dot product formula is |a||b|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. So, if the vectors are perpendicular, theta is 90 degrees, and cos(90) is zero, which is why the dot product is zero. That's another way to think about it, but for this problem, the algebraic approach was sufficient.Another thing I might consider is visualizing the vectors. Vector a is (2, x) and vector b is (-1, 2). If I plot these vectors on a coordinate plane, vector a would start at the origin and go 2 units to the right and x units up. Vector b would start at the origin, go 1 unit to the left, and 2 units up. Since they are perpendicular, they should form a right angle where they meet at the origin.Plotting them might help me get a better intuition about why x has to be 1. If x were something else, say 0, then vector a would be (2, 0), which is along the x-axis, and vector b would be (-1, 2). The angle between them wouldn't be 90 degrees. But when x is 1, vector a is (2, 1), which is somewhere in the first quadrant, and vector b is (-1, 2), which is in the second quadrant. The angle between them should be 90 degrees, which makes sense.I wonder if there's another way to solve this problem without using the dot product. Maybe using slopes? Let me think about that.If I consider the vectors as lines in the plane, the slope of vector a would be (x - 0)/(2 - 0) = x/2. The slope of vector b would be (2 - 0)/(-1 - 0) = 2/(-1) = -2. If two lines are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. So, if m1 * m2 = -1, then (x/2)*(-2) = -1.Let me write that out:(x/2)*(-2) = -1Simplify:(-2x)/2 = -1Which simplifies to:-x = -1Multiply both sides by -1:x = 1So, that's another method, using the slopes of the vectors. It also gives me x = 1, which is consistent with the dot product method. That's reassuring. It shows that different approaches can lead to the same solution, which is a good way to verify the answer.This makes me think that in problems involving perpendicularity, both the dot product and slope methods can be useful. The dot product is more straightforward when dealing with vectors, but if I can represent the vectors as lines, the slope method is also a viable alternative.I suppose the key takeaway here is that multiple methods can be used to solve the same problem, and it's good to be familiar with different approaches so that I can choose the one that seems most efficient or that I'm more comfortable with.Another thought: if the vectors weren't in two dimensions, but in three or more, the slope method wouldn't work because slopes are a two-dimensional concept. In higher dimensions, the dot product method is the way to go. So, it's important to understand both methods and when each is applicable.But in this case, since we're dealing with two-dimensional vectors, both methods are valid and lead to the same result. It's nice to see the connection between the algebraic dot product and the geometric interpretation of slopes.Just to make sure I haven't overlooked anything, let me review the problem statement again. It says vector a is (2, x) and vector b is (-1, 2), and they are perpendicular. Find x. I found x = 1, and both methods confirm that. I don't think I made any calculation errors, and my reasoning seems solid.I guess another way to think about it is in terms of projections. If vector a is perpendicular to vector b, then the projection of vector a onto vector b should be zero. The formula for the projection of a onto b is (a · b / |b|²) * b. Since a · b is zero, the projection is zero, which again confirms that they are perpendicular. But that's kind of going back to the dot product method, so it's not a new approach, but it reinforces the concept.Also, thinking about the graphical representation, if vector a is (2, 1), it's pointing to the point (2,1) from the origin, and vector b is (-1, 2), pointing to (-1,2). The angle between them is 90 degrees, so they form a right angle. If I imagine these two vectors, they should form a right-angled triangle with the origin.I think I've covered all the angles here. I've used two different methods to solve for x, verified the solution, and even thought about the geometric interpretation. It seems like a thorough approach.One last check: if x were something else, say x = 2, then vector a would be (2, 2). The dot product with vector b would be 2*(-1) + 2*2 = -2 + 4 = 2, which isn't zero, so they wouldn't be perpendicular. Similarly, if x were 0, the dot product would be -2 + 0 = -2, which isn't zero. So, x has to be 1 to make the dot product zero.Alright, I think I'm confident that x = 1 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The real number ( x ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"During the epidemic, in order to fight against the new coronavirus and achieve victory as soon as possible, six teachers signed up for volunteer service. The community streets assigned these six teachers to assist medical staff in conducting nucleic acid testing in four neighborhoods. Each neighborhood must have at least 1 person. Then, the number of different distribution schemes is ______. (Express the result numerically)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where six teachers signed up for volunteer service during an epidemic. The community needs to assign these six teachers to four neighborhoods to assist with nucleic acid testing. Each neighborhood must have at least one teacher. I need to figure out how many different distribution schemes there are. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when we're distributing objects (in this case, teachers) into different groups (neighborhoods) with certain conditions, we can use combinatorics. Since each neighborhood must have at least one teacher, this is a problem of partitioning the six teachers into four non-empty groups. I think this relates to the concept of surjective functions in combinatorics, where each element in the codomain (neighborhoods) is mapped to by at least one element from the domain (teachers). The number of such functions is given by the formula involving Stirling numbers of the second kind multiplied by the factorial of the number of neighborhoods. Let me recall: The number of ways to partition n distinct objects into k non-empty, unlabeled subsets is given by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as S(n, k). However, in this problem, the neighborhoods are distinct, meaning that the order matters. So, after partitioning the teachers into four groups, we also need to assign each group to a specific neighborhood. Therefore, the total number of distribution schemes should be S(6, 4) multiplied by 4! (since we can assign each partition to any of the four neighborhoods). But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. Alternatively, another approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The total number of ways to assign six teachers to four neighborhoods without any restrictions is 4^6. But since each neighborhood must have at least one teacher, we need to subtract the cases where one or more neighborhoods are empty.So, using inclusion-exclusion, the formula would be:Total = 4^6 - C(4,1)*3^6 + C(4,2)*2^6 - C(4,3)*1^6Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. Let me compute this step by step.First, compute 4^6. 4^6 is 4096.Next, compute C(4,1)*3^6. C(4,1) is 4, and 3^6 is 729. So, 4*729 = 2916.Then, compute C(4,2)*2^6. C(4,2) is 6, and 2^6 is 64. So, 6*64 = 384.Next, compute C(4,3)*1^6. C(4,3) is 4, and 1^6 is 1. So, 4*1 = 4.Putting it all together:Total = 4096 - 2916 + 384 - 4Let me compute each step:4096 - 2916 = 11801180 + 384 = 15641564 - 4 = 1560So, according to inclusion-exclusion, the total number of distribution schemes is 1560.Alternatively, using the Stirling numbers approach, S(6,4) is the number of ways to partition six teachers into four non-empty groups. I think S(6,4) is 65. Then, multiplying by 4! (which is 24) gives 65*24 = 1560. So, same result.Therefore, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.Wait, let me double-check the value of S(6,4). I might have forgotten the exact value. The Stirling numbers of the second kind can be computed using the recurrence relation:S(n, k) = S(n-1, k-1) + k*S(n-1, k)So, let's compute S(6,4):We can build up the Stirling numbers step by step.Starting from S(1,1) = 1.Then, for n=2:S(2,1) = 1S(2,2) = 1For n=3:S(3,1) = 1S(3,2) = S(2,1) + 2*S(2,2) = 1 + 2*1 = 3S(3,3) = 1For n=4:S(4,1) = 1S(4,2) = S(3,1) + 2*S(3,2) = 1 + 2*3 = 7S(4,3) = S(3,2) + 3*S(3,3) = 3 + 3*1 = 6S(4,4) = 1For n=5:S(5,1) = 1S(5,2) = S(4,1) + 2*S(4,2) = 1 + 2*7 = 15S(5,3) = S(4,2) + 3*S(4,3) = 7 + 3*6 = 7 + 18 = 25S(5,4) = S(4,3) + 4*S(4,4) = 6 + 4*1 = 10S(5,5) = 1For n=6:S(6,1) = 1S(6,2) = S(5,1) + 2*S(5,2) = 1 + 2*15 = 31S(6,3) = S(5,2) + 3*S(5,3) = 15 + 3*25 = 15 + 75 = 90S(6,4) = S(5,3) + 4*S(5,4) = 25 + 4*10 = 25 + 40 = 65Yes, so S(6,4) is indeed 65. Therefore, multiplying by 4! gives 65*24 = 1560. So, that's consistent with the inclusion-exclusion result.Just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using multinomial coefficients?Wait, the multinomial coefficient counts the number of ways to partition a set of objects into groups of specified sizes. But in this case, the sizes aren't specified; we just know that each group must have at least one. So, we would have to sum over all possible distributions where the sizes add up to 6 and each size is at least 1.But that sounds more complicated than using Stirling numbers or inclusion-exclusion. So, probably not the best approach here.Alternatively, thinking about arranging the teachers in a line and placing dividers between them to separate into neighborhoods. But since the neighborhoods are distinguishable, the order matters. So, that might be similar to the inclusion-exclusion approach.Wait, actually, arranging the teachers in a line and placing dividers is similar to the stars and bars method, but stars and bars counts the number of ways to distribute identical objects into distinct boxes, allowing empty boxes. But in this case, the teachers are distinct, so stars and bars doesn't directly apply.Alternatively, if the teachers were identical, the number of distributions would be C(6-1,4-1) = C(5,3) = 10, but since they're distinct, it's different.So, yeah, going back, the inclusion-exclusion method and the Stirling numbers both give 1560, so I think that's the correct answer.Just to recap:Total assignments without restrictions: 4^6 = 4096Subtract assignments where at least one neighborhood is empty: C(4,1)*3^6 = 2916Add back assignments where two neighborhoods are empty: C(4,2)*2^6 = 384Subtract assignments where three neighborhoods are empty: C(4,3)*1^6 = 4Total: 4096 - 2916 + 384 - 4 = 1560Yes, that seems solid.Alternatively, using Stirling numbers: S(6,4) = 65, then multiplied by 4! = 24, gives 65*24 = 1560.So, both methods confirm that the number of distribution schemes is 1560.I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The number of different distribution schemes is boxed{1560}."},{"question":"There are 37 ones written on a board. Every minute, Karlson erases two arbitrary numbers and writes their sum on the board. Then, he eats a number of candies equal to the product of the two erased numbers. What is the maximum number of candies he could eat in 37 minutes?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 37 ones written on a board. Every minute, Karlson erases two arbitrary numbers and writes their sum on the board. Then, he eats a number of candies equal to the product of the two erased numbers. The question is asking for the maximum number of candies he could eat in 37 minutes.Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step. We start with 37 ones. Each minute, Karlson combines two numbers by adding them together and replaces the two numbers with their sum. At the same time, he eats candies equal to the product of the two numbers he erased. So, each operation reduces the total count of numbers on the board by one. Starting with 37 numbers, after 37 operations, there will be just one number left. So, the process continues until only one number remains.The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten over these 37 minutes. So, we need to figure out the strategy Karlson should follow to maximize the sum of the products of the pairs he combines each time.Let me think about how the process works. Each time he combines two numbers, say a and b, he replaces them with a + b and eats a*b candies. So, the total number of candies eaten is the sum of all such products over the 37 operations.I remember that in problems where you combine numbers and want to maximize the sum of products, it's often optimal to combine the smallest numbers first. This is because multiplying smaller numbers gives a smaller product, but if you combine them early, you can then combine the resulting larger number with other larger numbers, which might lead to a higher total sum. Wait, actually, hold on. Maybe it's the opposite? Let me think.Suppose we have two numbers, a and b. If we combine them early, the product a*b is added to the total, and then the resulting number a + b can be combined with other numbers. Alternatively, if we combine a with another number c first, then b with another number d, we get different products. Hmm, maybe it's better to combine larger numbers later because when you combine two large numbers, their product is larger, contributing more to the total.Wait, actually, I think the key is that the total sum of candies eaten is equal to the sum of all pairwise products of the original numbers. Wait, is that true? Let me recall.There's a formula in mathematics that says that the sum of all pairwise products of a set of numbers is equal to (sum of the numbers)^2 minus the sum of the squares of the numbers, all divided by 2. So, if we have numbers x1, x2, ..., xn, then the sum of all xi*xj for i < j is equal to [(sum xi)^2 - sum xi^2]/2.In our case, initially, all numbers are 1, so the sum is 37, and the sum of squares is 37 as well. So, the initial sum of all pairwise products is (37^2 - 37)/2 = (1369 - 37)/2 = 1332/2 = 666.But wait, in the process of combining numbers, each time we combine two numbers a and b, we replace them with a + b, and the total sum remains the same. So, the total sum of numbers on the board is always 37, regardless of how we combine them.However, the sum of the squares changes each time we combine two numbers. When we replace a and b with a + b, the sum of squares changes by (a + b)^2 - a^2 - b^2 = 2ab. So, each combination increases the sum of squares by 2ab, which is exactly twice the number of candies eaten in that step.Therefore, the total sum of candies eaten is equal to (final sum of squares - initial sum of squares)/2.Since the initial sum of squares is 37 (because all numbers are 1), and the final sum of squares is just the square of the final number, which is 37^2 = 1369. So, the total sum of candies eaten is (1369 - 37)/2 = 1332/2 = 666.Wait, so does that mean that no matter how Karlson combines the numbers, he will always end up eating 666 candies in total? But that contradicts the idea that there is a maximum number of candies he could eat. So, perhaps my reasoning is flawed.Hold on, let me double-check. The formula says that the sum of all pairwise products is equal to (sum^2 - sum of squares)/2. But in our case, the total sum of candies eaten is the sum of all the products of the pairs that were combined. Each combination step corresponds to one pair being multiplied and added to the total.But in reality, each number is being combined multiple times. For example, a number might be combined in the first step, then the resulting number is combined again in the next step, and so on, until it's part of the final number.Therefore, the total candies eaten are actually the sum of all the products of the pairs at each step. So, each time two numbers are combined, their product is added to the total. Therefore, the total candies eaten is equal to the sum over all combination steps of a_i * b_i, where a_i and b_i are the numbers combined at step i.But how does this relate to the sum of squares? Each time we combine a and b, the sum of squares increases by 2ab, as I thought earlier. So, the total increase in the sum of squares is 2 times the total candies eaten. Therefore, total candies eaten = (final sum of squares - initial sum of squares)/2.Since the initial sum of squares is 37, and the final sum of squares is 37^2 = 1369, the total candies eaten is (1369 - 37)/2 = 1332/2 = 666.So, according to this, no matter how Karlson combines the numbers, he will always eat 666 candies in total. Therefore, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 666.But wait, that seems counterintuitive because I thought maybe the order of combining affects the total. Maybe not. Let me think again.Suppose we have just two numbers, 1 and 1. If we combine them, we get 2, and we eat 1*1 = 1 candy. Total candies eaten: 1. Alternatively, if we had three numbers, 1, 1, 1.If we first combine two 1s: 1+1=2, eat 1 candy. Then combine 2 and 1: 2+1=3, eat 2*1=2 candies. Total candies: 1 + 2 = 3.Alternatively, if we first combine 1 and 1 to get 2, eat 1 candy. Then combine 2 and 1 to get 3, eat 2 candies. Same result.Alternatively, suppose we have four numbers: 1,1,1,1.First, combine two 1s: get 2, eat 1. Then combine two 1s: get 2, eat 1. Then combine 2 and 2: get 4, eat 4. Total candies: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.Alternatively, combine 1 and 1 to get 2, eat 1. Then combine 2 and 1 to get 3, eat 2. Then combine 3 and 1 to get 4, eat 3. Total candies: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.Same result. So, regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is the same.Wait, so in all these cases, regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is fixed. So, in the original problem, regardless of how Karlson combines the numbers, he will always eat 666 candies in total.Therefore, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 666.But wait, let me test with a different example. Suppose we have three numbers: 1, 2, 3.If we combine 1 and 2 first: get 3, eat 2. Then combine 3 and 3: get 6, eat 9. Total candies: 2 + 9 = 11.Alternatively, combine 2 and 3 first: get 5, eat 6. Then combine 1 and 5: get 6, eat 5. Total candies: 6 + 5 = 11.Alternatively, combine 1 and 3 first: get 4, eat 3. Then combine 4 and 2: get 6, eat 8. Total candies: 3 + 8 = 11.Same result. So, regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is the same.Therefore, in the original problem, the total candies eaten is fixed, regardless of the order of combination. So, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 666.Wait, but the problem says \\"the maximum number of candies he could eat in 37 minutes.\\" So, maybe I was overcomplicating it. The total is fixed, so the maximum is 666.But let me think again. The initial sum of squares is 37, and the final sum of squares is 37^2 = 1369. Therefore, the total increase in sum of squares is 1369 - 37 = 1332. Since each combination increases the sum of squares by 2ab, the total increase is 2 times the total candies eaten. Therefore, total candies eaten = 1332 / 2 = 666.Therefore, regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is 666. So, the maximum is 666.But wait, let me think about another perspective. Maybe the way of combining affects the distribution of the numbers, but the total sum of products is fixed.Yes, because each time you combine two numbers, you're effectively adding their product to the total, and the way you combine them doesn't change the overall sum. It's similar to the concept of the sum of products being invariant under the order of operations.Therefore, the total number of candies eaten is fixed, so the maximum is 666.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's phrased as \\"the maximum number of candies he could eat in 37 minutes.\\" So, is 666 the answer? Or is there a way to get more?Wait, no, because the total is fixed. So, regardless of how he combines, he can't get more than 666. So, 666 is both the minimum and maximum.But wait, in the examples I did earlier with smaller numbers, the total was fixed regardless of the order. So, in the original problem, the total is fixed, so the maximum is 666.Therefore, the answer is 666.But wait, 37 ones. So, the initial sum is 37, and the initial sum of squares is 37. The final number is 37, so the final sum of squares is 37^2 = 1369. Therefore, the total increase in sum of squares is 1369 - 37 = 1332. Since each combination step increases the sum of squares by 2ab, the total candies eaten is 1332 / 2 = 666.Therefore, the answer is 666.But let me check with another small example to make sure.Suppose we have four ones: 1,1,1,1.Total sum is 4. Sum of squares is 4.If we combine two ones: get 2, eat 1. Now we have 2,1,1.Combine two ones: get 2, eat 1. Now we have 2,2.Combine 2 and 2: get 4, eat 4. Total candies: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.Alternatively, combine 1 and 1 to get 2, eat 1. Then combine 2 and 1 to get 3, eat 2. Then combine 3 and 1 to get 4, eat 3. Total candies: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.Alternatively, combine 1 and 1 to get 2, eat 1. Then combine 2 and 1 to get 3, eat 2. Then combine 3 and 1 to get 4, eat 3. Same total.Alternatively, combine 1 and 1 to get 2, eat 1. Then combine 2 and 1 to get 3, eat 2. Then combine 3 and 1 to get 4, eat 3. Same.Alternatively, combine 1 and 1 to get 2, eat 1. Then combine 2 and 1 to get 3, eat 2. Then combine 3 and 1 to get 4, eat 3. Same.So, in all cases, the total is 6, which is equal to (4^2 - 4)/2 = (16 - 4)/2 = 12/2 = 6.Therefore, the formula holds.Therefore, for 37 ones, the total is (37^2 - 37)/2 = (1369 - 37)/2 = 1332/2 = 666.Therefore, the maximum number of candies he could eat is 666.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The maximum number of candies Karlson could eat in 37 minutes is boxed{666}."},{"question":"There are one hundred tickets to be sold for a volleyball game.

Then there's another square, ABCD, which is tangent to each of these semicircles, and its sides are parallel to the original square. I need to find the area of square ABCD.Hmm, let me visualize this. The original square is 4x4, so each side is 4 units long. On each side, there's a semicircle. So, on the top side, there's a semicircle facing outward, same with the bottom, left, and right sides. So, if I imagine the square, it's like each side has a half-circle bulging out.Now, square ABCD is tangent to each of these semicircles, and its sides are parallel to the original square. So, ABCD must be a square that's sort of hugging these semicircles from the outside. Since the semicircles are on all four sides, ABCD must be larger than the original square, right? Because it has to touch each of these semicircles.Wait, but hold on. If the semicircles are on the outside, and ABCD is tangent to them, maybe ABCD is actually inside the original square? No, that doesn't make sense because the semicircles are constructed around the outside of the original square. So, ABCD must be outside, touching each of these semicircles.Wait, but the problem says \\"around the outside,\\" so the semicircles are outside the original square. So, ABCD is another square, outside the original square, tangent to each of these four semicircles, and its sides are parallel to the original square.So, the original square is 4x4, and ABCD is a square that's tangent to the four semicircles on each side. So, I need to figure out the side length of ABCD.Let me try to sketch this mentally. The original square has four semicircles on each side. Each semicircle has a diameter of 4 units, so the radius is 2 units. So, each semicircle has a radius of 2.Now, square ABCD is tangent to each of these semicircles. Since ABCD is parallel to the original square, it must be offset by some distance from each side. Let me think about how much the square ABCD is offset.If I consider one side, say the top side of the original square, there's a semicircle on top of it with radius 2. The square ABCD has to be tangent to this semicircle. So, the distance from the top side of the original square to the top side of ABCD must be equal to the radius of the semicircle, which is 2. But wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Because the semicircle is on the outside, so the square ABCD is outside the original square and the semicircles. So, the distance from the original square to ABCD must be such that ABCD is tangent to the semicircles.Let me think about the geometry here. If I have a semicircle on the top side of the original square, its center is at the midpoint of the top side, which is (2,4) if we consider the original square with coordinates from (0,0) to (4,4). The semicircle is facing upwards, so its equation would be something like (x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 2^2, but only for y ≥ 4.Similarly, the semicircle on the bottom would be facing downwards, centered at (2,0), with equation (x - 2)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 2^2, for y ≤ 0.Same for the left and right sides: the left semicircle is centered at (0,2), facing left, equation (x - 0)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 2^2, for x ≤ 0, and the right semicircle is centered at (4,2), facing right, equation (x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 2^2, for x ≥ 4.Now, square ABCD is tangent to all four semicircles. Since it's a square, all sides are equal and parallel. Let me consider the top side of ABCD. It must be tangent to the top semicircle. Similarly, the bottom side must be tangent to the bottom semicircle, and the left and right sides must be tangent to the left and right semicircles, respectively.So, let's figure out how far ABCD is from the original square. Let's denote the distance from the original square to ABCD as 'd'. Since ABCD is tangent to each semicircle, the distance 'd' must be equal to the radius of the semicircles, which is 2. But wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Because if the semicircles have a radius of 2, and ABCD is tangent to them, then the distance from the original square to ABCD must be equal to the radius. So, if the original square is 4x4, then ABCD would be offset by 2 units on each side, making its side length 4 + 2 + 2 = 8. But that would make the area 64, which is one of the options, E. But that seems too straightforward, and 64 is the area of the original square times 4, which might not make sense.Wait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again.If I have a semicircle on the top of the original square, and square ABCD is tangent to it, then the top side of ABCD must be tangent to the top semicircle. The top semicircle is centered at (2,4) with radius 2. The top side of ABCD is a horizontal line. The distance from the center of the semicircle to the top side of ABCD must be equal to the radius, which is 2.But the center of the semicircle is at (2,4), and the top side of ABCD is a horizontal line above it. So, the distance from (2,4) to the top side of ABCD is 2. Therefore, the top side of ABCD is at y = 4 + 2 = 6.Similarly, the bottom side of ABCD is tangent to the bottom semicircle, which is centered at (2,0). The distance from (2,0) to the bottom side of ABCD is 2, so the bottom side is at y = 0 - 2 = -2.Similarly, the left side of ABCD is tangent to the left semicircle, which is centered at (0,2). The distance from (0,2) to the left side of ABCD is 2, so the left side is at x = 0 - 2 = -2.And the right side of ABCD is tangent to the right semicircle, centered at (4,2). The distance from (4,2) to the right side of ABCD is 2, so the right side is at x = 4 + 2 = 6.Therefore, square ABCD extends from x = -2 to x = 6, and y = -2 to y = 6. So, the side length is 6 - (-2) = 8 units. Therefore, the area is 8^2 = 64. So, the answer is E) 64.Wait, but the original square is 4x4, and ABCD is 8x8, which is four times the area. But let me double-check because sometimes tangents can be tricky.Alternatively, maybe the square ABCD is not as big as 8x8. Maybe the distance is not just 2 units, but something else because of the direction of the tangent.Wait, let me think about the tangent line to a semicircle. For a semicircle, the tangent line at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if I have a semicircle on top, centered at (2,4), and the tangent line is the top side of ABCD, which is horizontal. The radius at the point of tangency would be vertical, because the tangent is horizontal.So, the point of tangency would be at (2,4 + 2) = (2,6). So, the top side of ABCD is the line y = 6, which is 2 units above the center. Similarly, the bottom side is y = -2, 2 units below the center of the bottom semicircle.Same for the left and right sides: the left side is x = -2, 2 units left of the center of the left semicircle, and the right side is x = 6, 2 units right of the center of the right semicircle.So, yes, that seems correct. So, the square ABCD is indeed 8x8, so the area is 64, which is option E.But wait, the answer choices include 16, 32, 36, 48, 64. So, 64 is an option, but I'm a bit confused because the original square is 4x4, and the constructed square is 8x8, which is quite a bit larger. But given the semicircles are on all four sides, and the square has to be tangent to all of them, it makes sense that it's offset by 2 units on each side, leading to a total side length of 8.Wait, but let me think again. If each side is offset by 2 units, then the side length increases by 4 units in total (2 on each side). So, 4 + 4 = 8, so the area is 64. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe the square ABCD is inside the original square? But that doesn't make sense because the semicircles are constructed around the outside of the original square. So, if ABCD is tangent to the semicircles, it must be outside.Wait, another thought: maybe the square ABCD is rotated? But the problem says its sides are parallel to the original square, so it can't be rotated. So, it's axis-aligned, just larger.Alternatively, perhaps the distance isn't 2 units, but something else. Let me think about the tangent line.For a semicircle on top, the equation is (x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 4, with y ≥ 4. The tangent line to this semicircle that's horizontal (since ABCD's top side is horizontal) must be y = 6, because the radius is 2, so moving up 2 units from the center at (2,4) gives y = 6. Similarly, the bottom tangent is y = -2, left is x = -2, right is x = 6.So, yeah, that seems correct. So, ABCD is from (-2, -2) to (6,6), making each side 8 units, so area 64.But wait, let me check if the square is actually 8x8. If the original square is 4x4, and you add 2 units on each side, both left and right, top and bottom, then the total increase per dimension is 4 units, so 4 + 4 = 8. So, yes, that makes sense.Alternatively, maybe the square is smaller? Wait, no, because the semicircles are on the outside, so the square ABCD has to be outside, touching the semicircles. So, it's definitely larger.Wait, but let me think about the figure. If the semicircles are on the outside, then the square ABCD is circumscribing these semicircles. So, the distance from the original square to ABCD is equal to the radius of the semicircles, which is 2. So, the side length of ABCD is 4 + 2*2 = 8, as we thought.Therefore, the area is 8^2 = 64, which is option E.But hold on, the answer choices include 36, which is 6^2, and 32, which is not a square. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.Wait, another thought: perhaps the square ABCD is not offset uniformly on all sides, but instead, the distance from the original square is such that the sides are tangent to the semicircles, but not necessarily offset by the full radius.Wait, let me think about the tangent line to a semicircle. For a semicircle on top, the tangent line is horizontal, so the distance from the center to the tangent line is equal to the radius. So, in this case, the center is at (2,4), and the tangent line is y = 6, which is 2 units above. So, that's correct.Similarly, for the semicircle on the right, centered at (4,2), the tangent line is vertical, x = 6, which is 2 units to the right. So, same idea.Therefore, the square ABCD is indeed 8x8, so area 64.Wait, but let me check the answer choices again. The options are 16, 32, 36, 48, 64. So, 64 is an option, so that must be the answer.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using coordinate geometry.Let me place the original square on a coordinate system with its bottom-left corner at (0,0), so the square spans from (0,0) to (4,4). The four semicircles are on each side:1. Top semicircle: center at (2,4), radius 2, equation: (x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 4, y ≥ 4.2. Bottom semicircle: center at (2,0), radius 2, equation: (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4, y ≤ 0.3. Left semicircle: center at (0,2), radius 2, equation: x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4, x ≤ 0.4. Right semicircle: center at (4,2), radius 2, equation: (x - 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4, x ≥ 4.Now, square ABCD is tangent to all four semicircles and has sides parallel to the original square. Let's denote the side length of ABCD as 's', and since it's a square, all sides are equal. Let's assume that ABCD is centered at the same center as the original square, which is (2,2). So, the coordinates of ABCD would be from (2 - s/2, 2 - s/2) to (2 + s/2, 2 + s/2).But wait, no, because ABCD is tangent to the semicircles, which are outside the original square. So, ABCD must be outside the original square, so its center is still at (2,2), but its sides are offset outward.Wait, but if the original square is 4x4, then the distance from the center to each side is 2 units. So, for ABCD, the distance from the center to each side must be 2 + d, where d is the distance from the original square to ABCD.But since ABCD is tangent to the semicircles, which have a radius of 2, the distance from the center of the semicircle to the side of ABCD must be equal to the radius, which is 2.Wait, let's think about the top semicircle. Its center is at (2,4), and the top side of ABCD is a horizontal line. The distance from (2,4) to this line must be equal to 2. Since the line is above the center, the y-coordinate of the line is 4 + 2 = 6. Similarly, the bottom side is at y = -2, left side at x = -2, and right side at x = 6.Therefore, ABCD spans from (-2, -2) to (6,6), making its side length 8, so area 64.Alternatively, if I think about the distance from the center of the original square (2,2) to the sides of ABCD, it's 2 (original distance) + 2 (radius) = 4. So, the distance from center to each side is 4, meaning the side length is 8.Yes, that seems consistent.Wait, but let me think about another way. If I consider the top side of ABCD, which is tangent to the top semicircle. The top semicircle is centered at (2,4) with radius 2. The equation of the top side of ABCD is y = k. The distance from the center (2,4) to the line y = k must be equal to the radius, which is 2. Since the semicircle is above the original square, the tangent line must be above the semicircle, so k = 4 + 2 = 6.Similarly, the bottom side is y = -2, left side x = -2, right side x = 6. So, ABCD is indeed 8x8, area 64.But wait, the answer choices include 36, which is 6x6. Maybe I'm miscalculating something.Wait, another approach: maybe the square ABCD is not offset by 2 units on each side, but the distance is calculated differently because the semicircles are on the outside.Wait, if I consider the square ABCD, each of its sides is tangent to a semicircle. So, for the top side, it's tangent to the top semicircle. The distance from the center of the top semicircle (2,4) to the top side of ABCD is equal to the radius, which is 2. Since the top semicircle is above the original square, the top side of ABCD must be 2 units above the center, so y = 6.Similarly, the bottom side is 2 units below the center of the bottom semicircle, which is at (2,0), so y = -2.Same for left and right sides: x = -2 and x = 6.Therefore, ABCD is indeed 8x8, so area 64.Wait, but maybe the square is not axis-aligned? But the problem says its sides are parallel to the original square, so it must be axis-aligned.Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the semicircles are constructed on the inside of the original square? But the problem says \\"around the outside,\\" so they must be on the outside.Wait, let me read the problem again: \\"Around the outside of a 4 by 4 square, construct four semicircles with the four sides of the square as their diameters.\\" So, yes, outside.\\"Another square, ABCD, has its sides parallel to the corresponding sides of the original square, and each side of ABCD is tangent to one of the semicircles.\\"So, ABCD is outside, tangent to each of the four semicircles, sides parallel.Therefore, the side length is 8, area 64.But wait, the answer choices are 16, 32, 36, 48, 64. So, 64 is an option, E.But I feel like 64 is too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, another thought: maybe the square ABCD is not just offset by 2 units, but the distance is calculated differently because the semicircles are on the sides.Wait, if I have a semicircle on the top, and the square ABCD is tangent to it, the distance from the original square to ABCD is not just the radius, but maybe something else.Wait, let me think about the tangent line to a semicircle.For a semicircle on top, the equation is (x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 4, with y ≥ 4.The tangent line to this semicircle is the top side of ABCD, which is horizontal, say y = k.The distance from the center (2,4) to the line y = k must be equal to the radius, which is 2.The distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line y = k is |k - y0|.So, |k - 4| = 2.Since the tangent line is above the semicircle, k = 4 + 2 = 6.Similarly, for the bottom semicircle, the tangent line is y = -2.Same for left and right.Therefore, the square ABCD is from (-2, -2) to (6,6), which is 8x8, area 64.So, I think that's correct. Maybe I was overcomplicating it, but I think 64 is the right answer.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Calculate:<br/>(1) Calculate: 2a^{2}+9b-5a^{2}-4b.<br/>(2) Simplify first, then evaluate: 3mn^{2}+m^{2}n-2(2mn^{2}-m^{2}n), where m=1, n=-2.","answer":"First, I need to calculate the expression (2a^{2} + 9b - 5a^{2} - 4b). I'll start by identifying and combining the like terms. The terms involving (a^{2}) are (2a^{2}) and (-5a^{2}), and the terms involving (b) are (9b) and (-4b). Combining these, I get (-3a^{2} + 5b).Next, I'll simplify the expression (3mn^{2} + m^{2}n - 2(2mn^{2} - m^{2}n)).

Given that (AB = 8), (AD = 10), and the area of triangle (DFG) is 30, what is the area of rectangle (BGEF)?","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a rectangle ABCD, where AB is 8 units and AD is 10 units. So, AB is the base with length 8, and AD is the height with length 10. That makes sense because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC would also be 10, and CD would be 8. Point E is an arbitrary point on the diagonal AC. Hmm, diagonal AC connects points A and C. Since ABCD is a rectangle, the diagonal AC should have a length that can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Let me compute that real quick: AC = sqrt(AB² + AD²) = sqrt(8² + 10²) = sqrt(64 + 100) = sqrt(164). But maybe I don't need that right now.Through point E, they draw lines perpendicular to AB and BC. So, one line is perpendicular to AB, which is the base, and another is perpendicular to BC, which is the side. These lines intersect AB at point F and BC at point G, respectively. So, EF is perpendicular to AB, and EG is perpendicular to BC. Then, they connect segments DF, FG, and GD, forming triangle DFG. The area of triangle DFG is given as 30. The question is asking for the area of rectangle BGEF.Alright, let me try to sketch this mentally. So, rectangle ABCD: A is bottom-left, B is bottom-right, C is top-right, D is top-left. Diagonal AC goes from A to C. Point E is somewhere on AC. From E, we drop a perpendicular to AB, which is the base, so that would be a vertical line if AB is horizontal. Wait, no, actually, AB is horizontal, so a line perpendicular to AB would be vertical. Similarly, BC is vertical, so a line perpendicular to BC would be horizontal.Wait, hold on. If AB is horizontal, then a line perpendicular to AB would be vertical. So, from E, if we draw a vertical line down to AB, that would be point F. Similarly, BC is vertical, so a line perpendicular to BC would be horizontal. So, from E, drawing a horizontal line to BC would give us point G.So, EF is vertical, connecting E to F on AB, and EG is horizontal, connecting E to G on BC. So, BGEF is a rectangle because both EF and BG are vertical, and BE and FG are horizontal? Wait, no, hold on. Let me clarify.Wait, point G is on BC, so BG is part of BC, which is vertical. But EG is horizontal. So, rectangle BGEF would have sides BG, GE, EF, and FB. Since BG is vertical, GE is horizontal, EF is vertical, and FB is horizontal. So, yes, BGEF is a rectangle.Alright, so we have rectangle BGEF inside the rectangle ABCD, and triangle DFG with area 30. We need to find the area of BGEF.Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle to make this easier. Let's place point A at (0, 0). Then, since AB is 8, point B is at (8, 0). AD is 10, so point D is at (0, 10), and point C is at (8, 10). Diagonal AC goes from (0, 0) to (8, 10). Point E is somewhere on AC. Let me parameterize point E. Let's let E divide AC in the ratio t:(1-t), where t is between 0 and 1. So, the coordinates of E can be expressed as (8t, 10t). Because moving from A(0,0) to C(8,10), each coordinate increases proportionally.Now, from E(8t, 10t), we draw a vertical line down to AB, which is the x-axis. So, point F would have the same x-coordinate as E, but y-coordinate 0. So, F is (8t, 0). Similarly, drawing a horizontal line from E to BC, which is the line x=8. Wait, no, BC is the vertical side from (8,0) to (8,10). So, a horizontal line from E(8t,10t) would go towards BC. But BC is at x=8, so the horizontal line from E would intersect BC at point G(8,10t). Wait, hold on. If we draw a horizontal line from E(8t,10t), it would intersect BC at (8,10t). So, point G is (8,10t). Similarly, the vertical line from E(8t,10t) intersects AB at (8t,0), which is point F.So, now we have points F(8t, 0) and G(8,10t). Then, segments DF, FG, and GD are connected. So, D is (0,10), F is (8t,0), G is (8,10t), and back to D(0,10). So, triangle DFG is formed by points D(0,10), F(8t,0), and G(8,10t).We are told that the area of triangle DFG is 30. So, let's compute the area of triangle DFG in terms of t and set it equal to 30 to solve for t.To find the area of triangle DFG, we can use the shoelace formula or the determinant method. Let me write down the coordinates:D: (0,10)F: (8t,0)G: (8,10t)Using the determinant formula for the area of a triangle given three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3):Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|Plugging in the coordinates:Area = |(0*(0 - 10t) + 8t*(10t - 10) + 8*(10 - 0))/2|= |0 + 8t*(10t - 10) + 8*10| / 2= |8t*(10t - 10) + 80| / 2Let me compute 8t*(10t -10):= 80t² - 80tSo, Area = |80t² - 80t + 80| / 2Since all terms are positive or negative depending on t, but since area is positive, we can drop the absolute value:Area = (80t² - 80t + 80)/2 = 40t² - 40t + 40We are told this area is 30:40t² - 40t + 40 = 30Subtract 30 from both sides:40t² - 40t + 10 = 0Divide both sides by 10:4t² - 4t + 1 = 0Now, let's solve for t:Using quadratic formula, t = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 16)] / 8 = [4 ± 0]/8 = 4/8 = 1/2So, t = 1/2So, point E is at (8*(1/2), 10*(1/2)) = (4,5). So, E is the midpoint of AC.Therefore, point F is (4,0) and point G is (8,5).Now, we need to find the area of rectangle BGEF.Points B, G, E, F:Point B is (8,0)Point G is (8,5)Point E is (4,5)Point F is (4,0)So, rectangle BGEF has vertices at (8,0), (8,5), (4,5), (4,0). So, it's a rectangle with length along the y-axis from 0 to 5, and width along the x-axis from 4 to 8.So, the width is 8 - 4 = 4 units, and the height is 5 - 0 = 5 units.Therefore, the area is width * height = 4 * 5 = 20.Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, since it's a rectangle, the sides are BG and GE.Point B is (8,0), G is (8,5). So, BG is vertical with length 5.Point G is (8,5), E is (4,5). So, GE is horizontal with length 4.So, the sides are 5 and 4, so area is 20.Alternatively, using coordinates, the area can be found by the product of the lengths of adjacent sides.Yes, that seems consistent.But just to be thorough, let me compute the area using coordinates.Using the shoelace formula for rectangle BGEF:Points in order: B(8,0), G(8,5), E(4,5), F(4,0), back to B(8,0).Compute the area:Area = 1/2 |(8*5 + 8*5 + 4*0 + 4*0) - (0*8 + 5*4 + 5*4 + 0*8)|Wait, that might be confusing. Alternatively, since it's a rectangle, it's simpler to compute as length * width.But for practice, let's use shoelace:List the coordinates:(8,0), (8,5), (4,5), (4,0), (8,0)Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1}:8*5 + 8*5 + 4*0 + 4*0 + 8*0 = 40 + 40 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 80Compute sum of y_i x_{i+1}:0*8 + 5*4 + 5*4 + 0*8 + 0*8 = 0 + 20 + 20 + 0 + 0 = 40Area = 1/2 |80 - 40| = 1/2 * 40 = 20So, yes, the area is 20.Therefore, the area of rectangle BGEF is 20.**Final Answer**The area of rectangle (BGEF) is boxed{20}."},{"question":"In connection with proof in geometry, indicate which one of the following statements is incorrect:textbf{(A)} text{Some statements are accepted without being proved.}textbf{(B)} text{In some instances there is more than one correct order in proving certain propositions.}textbf{(C)} text{Every term used in a proof must have been defined previously.}textbf{(D)} text{It is not possible to arrive by correct reasoning at a true conclusion if, in the given, there is an untrue proposition.}textbf{(E)} text{Indirect proof can be used whenever there are two or more contrary propositions.}","answer":"To determine which statement is incorrect, let's analyze each option:**Option A:** Some statements are accepted without being proved.This is correct.

The train travels at 60 kilometers per hour, and the car travels at twice that speed, which is 120 kilometers per hour.Next, I'll calculate the distance each vehicle travels in 3 hours. For the train, the distance is 60 km/h multiplied by 3 hours, resulting in 180 kilometers.

The problem says it has two distinct real roots, and I need to find a value for ( c ) that satisfies this condition. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the discriminant determines the nature of the roots. The discriminant is given by ( D = b^2 - 4ac ). If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it's zero, there's exactly one real root (a repeated root), and if it's negative, the roots are complex and not real.So, in this case, my equation is ( x^2 + 2x + 4c = 0 ). Comparing this to the standard form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), I can see that ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = 4c ). Wait, hold on, that might be confusing because the constant term here is also denoted by ( c ). Maybe I should clarify that.Let me rewrite the standard form as ( ax^2 + bx + k = 0 ) to avoid confusion with the given equation's constant term, which is ( 4c ). So, in this problem, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( k = 4c ). Got it.Now, the discriminant ( D ) for this equation would be ( D = b^2 - 4ak ). Plugging in the values, that's ( D = (2)^2 - 4(1)(4c) ). Calculating that, ( D = 4 - 16c ).Since the equation has two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive. So, I set up the inequality ( 4 - 16c > 0 ). Let me solve for ( c ).Subtracting 4 from both sides gives ( -16c > -4 ). Hmm, now I need to divide both sides by -16. But wait, when I divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, dividing both sides by -16, I get ( c < frac{-4}{-16} ), which simplifies to ( c < frac{1}{4} ).So, ( c ) must be less than ( frac{1}{4} ) for the equation to have two distinct real roots. The problem asks for a value that satisfies this condition, so I can choose any ( c ) less than ( frac{1}{4} ).Let me pick a simple value. How about ( c = 0 )? Plugging that back into the original equation, it becomes ( x^2 + 2x = 0 ), which factors to ( x(x + 2) = 0 ). The roots are ( x = 0 ) and ( x = -2 ), which are two distinct real roots. So, ( c = 0 ) works.Alternatively, I could choose another value, like ( c = -1 ). Plugging that in, the equation becomes ( x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 ). Let me check the discriminant for this: ( D = (2)^2 - 4(1)(-4) = 4 + 16 = 20 ), which is positive. So, yes, two distinct real roots.But since the question just asks for a value that satisfies the condition, I can choose any ( c ) less than ( frac{1}{4} ). Maybe the simplest one is ( c = 0 ), as I thought earlier.Wait, let me double-check my discriminant calculation. The original equation is ( x^2 + 2x + 4c = 0 ). So, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = 4c ). Wait, hold on, no, that's not right. In the standard quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the coefficients are ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). But in our problem, the constant term is ( 4c ). So, actually, in the standard form, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = 4c ). Wait, that's confusing because the constant term is also called ( c ). Maybe I should use a different variable to avoid confusion.Let me denote the constant term as ( k ) instead. So, the equation is ( x^2 + 2x + k = 0 ), where ( k = 4c ). Then, the discriminant is ( D = b^2 - 4ak = (2)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 4 - 4k ). Since we need two distinct real roots, ( D > 0 ), so ( 4 - 4k > 0 ). Solving for ( k ), subtract 4: ( -4k > -4 ), then divide by -4 (remembering to flip the inequality): ( k < 1 ).But ( k = 4c ), so ( 4c < 1 ), which gives ( c < frac{1}{4} ). So, that's consistent with what I had before.Therefore, any value of ( c ) less than ( frac{1}{4} ) will satisfy the condition. So, I can choose ( c = 0 ), ( c = -1 ), ( c = frac{1}{5} ), etc. Since the question just asks for a value, I can pick any of these.I think ( c = 0 ) is the simplest one. Let me verify once more. Plugging ( c = 0 ) into the equation: ( x^2 + 2x + 0 = 0 ), which simplifies to ( x(x + 2) = 0 ). So, the roots are ( x = 0 ) and ( x = -2 ), which are indeed two distinct real roots. Perfect.Alternatively, if I choose ( c = frac{1}{5} ), which is less than ( frac{1}{4} ), then the equation becomes ( x^2 + 2x + frac{4}{5} = 0 ). Let's compute the discriminant: ( D = 4 - 4(1)(frac{4}{5}) = 4 - frac{16}{5} = frac{20}{5} - frac{16}{5} = frac{4}{5} ), which is positive. So, two distinct real roots again.But since the question is asking for a value, I can just choose one. Maybe ( c = 0 ) is the easiest, but I can also choose a negative value, like ( c = -1 ), as I did earlier. Let me see what happens then.Plugging ( c = -1 ) into the equation: ( x^2 + 2x + 4(-1) = x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 ). The discriminant is ( 4 - 4(1)(-4) = 4 + 16 = 20 ), which is positive, so two distinct real roots. So, that works too.I think I'm confident now that ( c ) must be less than ( frac{1}{4} ), so any value below that is acceptable. Since the question is asking for a value, I can choose any one, but I think ( c = 0 ) is the simplest.Wait, just to make sure, let me check if ( c = frac{1}{4} ) is allowed. If ( c = frac{1}{4} ), then the equation becomes ( x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0 ), which factors to ( (x + 1)^2 = 0 ). So, it has a repeated root at ( x = -1 ). Since the problem specifies two distinct real roots, ( c = frac{1}{4} ) is not acceptable. Therefore, ( c ) must be strictly less than ( frac{1}{4} ).Alright, so to recap: For the quadratic equation ( x^2 + 2x + 4c = 0 ) to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive. The discriminant is ( 4 - 16c ), so we set ( 4 - 16c > 0 ), leading to ( c < frac{1}{4} ). Therefore, any value of ( c ) less than ( frac{1}{4} ) satisfies the condition.Since the question asks for a value, I can choose any such ( c ). I think ( c = 0 ) is the simplest, but ( c = -1 ) or ( c = frac{1}{5} ) are also valid. I'll go with ( c = 0 ) because it's straightforward and easy to verify.**Final Answer**The value of ( c ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"It is known that one of the four coins is counterfeit and differs in weight from the real ones. It is required to determine which coin is counterfeit using a balance scale without weights. Which of the listed statements are true?a) The counterfeit coin can be identified in 2 weighings.b) The counterfeit coin can be identified in 3 weighings.c) The counterfeit coin can be identified in 4 weighings.d) None of the listed answers are correct.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are four coins, and one of them is counterfeit. The counterfeit coin is different in weight from the real ones, but I don't know if it's heavier or lighter. I need to figure out which one is counterfeit using a balance scale without any weights. The question is asking which of the statements a), b), c), or d) are true regarding how many weighings it would take to identify the counterfeit coin.Let me start by recalling how balance scale problems usually work. Typically, with a balance scale, you can compare two groups of items and determine if they're equal, or if one side is heavier than the other. Each weighing gives you some information, which can help narrow down the possibilities.In this case, there are four coins, and one is counterfeit. So, initially, there are four possibilities. Each weighing can give us three outcomes: left side heavier, right side heavier, or both sides equal. So, each weighing can provide up to log base 3 of the number of possibilities information. Wait, let me think about that. The number of different outcomes with each weighing is 3. So, for n weighings, the maximum number of distinguishable outcomes is 3^n. Since we have four coins, each of which could be counterfeit, and each counterfeit could be heavier or lighter, that's actually 8 possibilities (4 coins * 2 possibilities each: heavy or light). Hmm, so 8 possibilities.So, if we have n weighings, the number of distinguishable outcomes is 3^n. We need 3^n to be at least 8. Let's calculate:3^1 = 3, which is less than 8.3^2 = 9, which is more than 8.So, in theory, 2 weighings should be sufficient to distinguish between 8 possibilities. But wait, is this always the case?Wait, hold on. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the specific problem here. We have four coins, one is counterfeit, but we don't know if it's heavier or lighter. So, actually, it's 4 coins, each with two possibilities, so 8 possibilities in total. So, to uniquely identify the counterfeit, we need enough information to distinguish between 8 cases.Each weighing can give us 3 outcomes, so with two weighings, we can have 3*3 = 9 different outcomes. Since 9 is more than 8, in theory, it should be possible to design a strategy that can identify the counterfeit in two weighings.But wait, let me think about how to actually perform the weighings. Maybe I'm too quick to assume that two weighings are enough. Let me try to outline a possible strategy.First, let's label the coins as A, B, C, D.First weighing: Let's weigh A against B.Case 1: A equals B. Then, the counterfeit is either C or D. Now, for the second weighing, we can weigh A against C.- If A equals C, then D is counterfeit. But we don't know if it's heavier or lighter. Wait, but in this case, since we've only done two weighings, we might not be able to determine if D is heavier or lighter. Hmm, that's a problem.Wait, no, actually, in the first weighing, A and B were equal, so they are both real coins. Then, in the second weighing, if we weigh A against C:- If A equals C, then D is counterfeit, and since we know A is real, we can compare D with A in the second weighing. Wait, but we only have two weighings. So, in the second weighing, if we weigh A against C and they are equal, we know D is counterfeit, but we don't know if it's heavier or lighter. But the problem only asks to identify which coin is counterfeit, not whether it's heavier or lighter. So, maybe that's okay.Wait, hold on. The problem says \\"determine which coin is counterfeit.\\" It doesn't specify whether we need to know if it's heavier or lighter. So, maybe that's acceptable.But let me think again. If in the first weighing, A equals B, so they are real. Then, in the second weighing, weigh A against C.- If A equals C, then D is counterfeit. So, we've identified D as counterfeit in two weighings.- If A is not equal to C, then we know that C is counterfeit, because A is real. But we don't know if it's heavier or lighter, but again, the problem only asks to identify which one is counterfeit, not the nature of the difference. So, that's okay.Wait, but hold on. If A and B are equal, and then A vs C is unequal, we know C is counterfeit, but we don't know if it's heavier or lighter. But in the problem statement, the counterfeit is known to differ in weight, but we don't know if it's heavier or lighter. So, maybe we can figure out whether it's heavier or lighter based on the direction of the tilt.Wait, in the first weighing, A and B are equal. In the second weighing, A vs C: if A goes down, then C is lighter; if A goes up, then C is heavier. So, actually, we can determine whether C is heavier or lighter. So, in that case, we can actually determine both which coin is counterfeit and whether it's heavier or lighter in two weighings.Wait, but the problem only asks to determine which coin is counterfeit, so maybe knowing the direction is not necessary, but it's still good to know.But let me think about the other case. If in the first weighing, A vs B, they are unequal. So, either A is heavier than B or B is heavier than A.So, suppose A is heavier than B. Then, we know that either A is heavy counterfeit or B is light counterfeit. So, in the second weighing, how can we determine which one it is?We can take one of them and weigh it against a known real coin. For example, weigh A against C.- If A equals C, then A is real, so B must be the light counterfeit.- If A is still heavier than C, then A is the heavy counterfeit.Similarly, if in the first weighing, B was heavier than A, we can weigh B against C:- If B equals C, then B is real, so A is light counterfeit.- If B is still heavier than C, then B is heavy counterfeit.So, in this case, with two weighings, we can determine which of A or B is counterfeit, and whether it's heavy or light.Therefore, in both cases, whether the first weighing is equal or unequal, we can determine the counterfeit in two weighings.Wait, but hold on. Let me test this with an example.Suppose the counterfeit is C, and it's heavier.First weighing: A vs B. They are equal.Second weighing: A vs C. C is heavier, so we know C is counterfeit.Another example: counterfeit is D, lighter.First weighing: A vs B. Equal.Second weighing: A vs C. Equal, so D is counterfeit.Another example: counterfeit is A, heavier.First weighing: A vs B. A is heavier.Second weighing: A vs C. A is heavier, so A is counterfeit.Another example: counterfeit is B, lighter.First weighing: A vs B. B is lighter.Second weighing: B vs C. B equals C, so B is counterfeit.Wait, hold on, in this case, if B is counterfeit and lighter, in the second weighing, if we weigh B against C, which is real, B would be lighter, so we can conclude B is counterfeit.Wait, but in my earlier strategy, I said to weigh A against C if A was heavier in the first weighing. But in this case, if B is lighter, maybe I should weigh B against C instead.Wait, maybe my strategy needs to be adjusted.Wait, let me clarify.If in the first weighing, A vs B, A is heavier.Then, in the second weighing, we can weigh A against C.- If A equals C, then A is real, so B must be light counterfeit.- If A is still heavier, then A is heavy counterfeit.Similarly, if in the first weighing, B is heavier than A, then in the second weighing, weigh B against C.- If B equals C, then B is real, so A is light counterfeit.- If B is still heavier, then B is heavy counterfeit.So, in this strategy, we can determine the counterfeit in two weighings.Therefore, it seems that two weighings are sufficient to identify the counterfeit coin among four, regardless of whether it's heavier or lighter.Wait, but let me think again. Is there any case where two weighings wouldn't be enough?Suppose the counterfeit is C, which is heavier.First weighing: A vs B. Equal.Second weighing: A vs C. C is heavier, so we know C is counterfeit.Similarly, if counterfeit is D, lighter.First weighing: A vs B. Equal.Second weighing: A vs C. Equal, so D is counterfeit.If counterfeit is A, heavier.First weighing: A vs B. A is heavier.Second weighing: A vs C. A is heavier, so A is counterfeit.If counterfeit is B, lighter.First weighing: A vs B. B is lighter.Second weighing: B vs C. B is lighter, so B is counterfeit.Wait, but in this case, if B is counterfeit and lighter, in the second weighing, B vs C, we can confirm it's lighter.But in my initial strategy, I said to weigh A vs C if A was heavier in the first weighing. So, maybe I need to adjust the strategy depending on whether the first weighing was A heavier or B heavier.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to, in the second weighing, compare one of the suspected coins with a known genuine coin.Wait, but in the first case, if A and B are equal, then C and D are suspects. So, in the second weighing, weigh A against C.If A equals C, then D is counterfeit.If A doesn't equal C, then C is counterfeit.Similarly, if in the first weighing, A and B are unequal, say A > B, then in the second weighing, weigh A against C.If A equals C, then B is counterfeit and lighter.If A > C, then A is counterfeit and heavier.Similarly, if B > A, then weigh B against C.If B equals C, then A is counterfeit and lighter.If B > C, then B is counterfeit and heavier.So, in all cases, two weighings are sufficient.Therefore, statement a) says \\"The counterfeit coin can be identified in 2 weighings.\\" So, that should be true.But wait, hold on. Let me think about another approach.Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, the minimal number of weighings is determined by the information theory approach, where each weighing can give up to log2(3) bits of information, but perhaps that's complicating it.But in this case, since we have 8 possibilities (4 coins, each could be heavy or light), and each weighing can give 3 outcomes, the maximum number of distinguishable outcomes with two weighings is 9, which is more than 8. So, in theory, two weighings should suffice.Therefore, statement a) is true.But wait, let me check if the problem specifies whether the counterfeit is heavier or lighter. It just says it's different in weight. So, we don't know if it's heavier or lighter, which is why we have 8 possibilities.But in the problem, do we need to determine whether it's heavier or lighter as well? The question only asks to determine which coin is counterfeit, not whether it's heavier or lighter. So, maybe we can do it in fewer weighings.Wait, but in my earlier strategy, we actually can determine both which coin is counterfeit and whether it's heavier or lighter in two weighings. So, if the problem only requires identifying the counterfeit, then two weighings are sufficient.But let me think again. If the problem only asks to identify the counterfeit, not whether it's heavier or lighter, then perhaps we can do it in one weighing? But no, because with one weighing, you can only compare two coins, and if they are equal, you know the counterfeit is among the other two, but you can't determine which one. So, one weighing is insufficient.Therefore, two weighings are necessary and sufficient.Wait, but let me think about another strategy. Maybe divide the coins into groups.First weighing: weigh A and B against C and D.Wait, but that's comparing two coins against two coins. Hmm, but with four coins, that might not be the most efficient.Wait, let's see. If we weigh A and B against C and D.Case 1: A + B equals C + D. Then, all four are real coins, which contradicts the problem statement because one is counterfeit. So, this case cannot happen.Wait, no, actually, if one of the four is counterfeit, then A + B vs C + D will not balance. So, the scale will tip to one side or the other.Wait, but if the counterfeit is among A, B, C, or D, and it's either heavier or lighter, then the total weight of A + B vs C + D will be unequal.But without knowing whether the counterfeit is heavier or lighter, it's hard to interpret the result.Wait, for example, suppose the counterfeit is A and it's heavier. Then, A + B would be heavier than C + D.If the counterfeit is D and it's lighter, then A + B would be heavier than C + D as well.So, in both cases, the scale would tip the same way, but the counterfeit could be A (heavy) or D (light). So, we can't distinguish between these two possibilities with just one weighing.Similarly, if the counterfeit is B (heavy) or C (light), the scale would tip the same way.Therefore, this approach might not be helpful because it doesn't narrow down the possibilities sufficiently.So, perhaps the better approach is to weigh one against one first, as I did earlier.So, first weighing: A vs B.If equal, counterfeit is C or D.Second weighing: A vs C.If equal, D is counterfeit.If not equal, C is counterfeit.If first weighing: A vs B are unequal.Then, the counterfeit is either A (heavy) or B (light), or vice versa.Second weighing: weigh A vs C.If A equals C, then B is counterfeit and light.If A is heavier than C, then A is counterfeit and heavy.Similarly, if B was heavier in the first weighing, weigh B vs C.If B equals C, then A is counterfeit and light.If B is heavier than C, then B is counterfeit and heavy.So, in all cases, two weighings are sufficient.Therefore, statement a) is correct.But wait, the options are:a) 2 weighingsb) 3 weighingsc) 4 weighingsd) None of the above.So, since a) is correct, the answer should be a). But wait, let me check the problem again.Wait, the problem says \\"It is known that one of the four coins is counterfeit and differs in weight from the real ones. It is required to determine which coin is counterfeit using a balance scale without weights.\\"So, the question is, which of the statements a), b), c), or d) are true.So, a) is true, because we can do it in two weighings.But hold on, in my earlier reasoning, I assumed that in two weighings, we can determine both the counterfeit and whether it's heavy or light. But the problem only asks to determine which coin is counterfeit, not whether it's heavy or light. So, maybe we can do it in one weighing? But no, as I thought earlier, one weighing is insufficient because if you weigh two coins against two coins, you can't determine which one is counterfeit. If you weigh one against one, and they are equal, you know the counterfeit is among the other two, but you can't determine which one. So, you need a second weighing.Alternatively, if you weigh one against one, and they are unequal, you know the counterfeit is one of those two, but you don't know which one, so you need a second weighing to determine which one it is.Therefore, two weighings are necessary.So, statement a) is correct.But wait, let me think again. Is there a way to do it in one weighing? Probably not, because with one weighing, you can only get limited information. For example, if you weigh A vs B:- If equal, counterfeit is C or D.- If unequal, counterfeit is A or B.But you can't determine which one in one weighing.Therefore, two weighings are necessary.So, statement a) is correct.But wait, let me check the information theory approach again. The number of possible outcomes is 8 (4 coins, each could be heavy or light). Each weighing can give 3 outcomes, so two weighings give 9 possible outcomes. Since 9 > 8, it's possible to design a strategy that uniquely identifies the counterfeit in two weighings.Therefore, statement a) is correct.But wait, let me think about another angle. Suppose we don't know if the counterfeit is heavier or lighter. So, in the first weighing, if we weigh A vs B:- If equal, counterfeit is C or D.- If unequal, counterfeit is A or B, but we don't know if it's heavy or light.So, in the second weighing, if we have to determine between two possibilities (C or D, or A or B), but with the added complexity of not knowing if it's heavy or light, we need to design the second weighing in a way that can disambiguate.Wait, but in my earlier strategy, I was able to do that by weighing against a known genuine coin.So, for example, if A vs B are unequal, then in the second weighing, weigh A against C.- If A equals C, then B is counterfeit and light.- If A is still heavier, then A is counterfeit and heavy.Similarly, if B was heavier, weigh B against C.- If B equals C, then A is counterfeit and light.- If B is still heavier, then B is counterfeit and heavy.So, in this way, we can determine the counterfeit in two weighings, even without knowing if it's heavy or light.Therefore, statement a) is correct.But wait, let me think about another strategy where we might need three weighings. Maybe if we don't have a known genuine coin, but in this case, after the first weighing, if A and B are equal, then we know they are genuine, so we can use them as reference in the second weighing.So, in that case, two weighings are sufficient.Therefore, I think statement a) is correct.But wait, let me check online or recall if this is a standard problem.Wait, I recall that with four coins, one counterfeit, it can be done in two weighings. Yes, that's a standard result.Therefore, statement a) is correct.But wait, the options are a), b), c), d). So, since a) is correct, the answer should be a). But let me check the problem again to make sure I didn't misread anything.The problem says: \\"It is known that one of the four coins is counterfeit and differs in weight from the real ones. It is required to determine which coin is counterfeit using a balance scale without weights. Which of the listed statements are true?\\"So, the key points are:- Four coins, one counterfeit.- Counterfeit differs in weight (could be heavier or lighter).- Determine which coin is counterfeit.- Using a balance scale without weights.So, the question is about the minimal number of weighings required.From my reasoning, two weighings are sufficient, so statement a) is correct.But wait, let me think about another approach where maybe three weighings are needed. For example, if we don't have a reference coin, but in this case, after the first weighing, if A and B are equal, they become reference coins.Alternatively, if we use a different strategy, like dividing into groups.First weighing: A vs B.If equal, counterfeit is C or D.Second weighing: C vs D.- If equal, which can't happen because one is counterfeit.Wait, no, if counterfeit is among C or D, and we weigh C vs D, if they are unequal, we know which one is counterfeit, but we don't know if it's heavy or light. But since the problem only asks to identify the counterfeit, not whether it's heavy or light, then in two weighings, we can identify it.Wait, but if we weigh C vs D in the second weighing, and they are unequal, we know the counterfeit is the one that's heavier or lighter, but we don't know which. Wait, no, we do know which one is counterfeit because one side will be heavier or lighter, but we don't know if the counterfeit is heavy or light.Wait, no, actually, if we know that one of them is counterfeit, and the scale tips, then the counterfeit is the one that caused the tip. But since we don't know if it's heavy or light, we can't be sure. Wait, no, actually, if we have a reference, we can determine.Wait, let me clarify.If in the first weighing, A vs B are equal, so they are genuine.Second weighing: weigh A against C.- If A equals C, then D is counterfeit.- If A doesn't equal C, then C is counterfeit.So, in this case, we don't need to weigh C vs D, because we can use A as a reference.Therefore, this strategy is more efficient.So, in two weighings, we can determine the counterfeit.Therefore, statement a) is correct.But wait, let me think again. If I don't use A as a reference, and instead weigh C vs D, then:First weighing: A vs B equal.Second weighing: C vs D.If C vs D are unequal, then we know the counterfeit is either C or D, but we don't know which one, because we don't know if it's heavy or light.Wait, no, actually, if we know that one of them is counterfeit, and the scale tips, then the counterfeit is the one that's heavier or lighter, but since we don't know if it's heavy or light, we can't be sure which one it is.Wait, no, that's not correct. If we have a reference, like A, which is genuine, we can compare C against A.Wait, but in the second weighing, if we weigh C vs D, and they are unequal, we don't have a reference anymore because we don't know if C or D is counterfeit, and whether it's heavy or light.Wait, so in that case, we can't determine the counterfeit in two weighings if we use that strategy.Therefore, the better strategy is to use a genuine coin as a reference in the second weighing, which allows us to determine the counterfeit.Therefore, statement a) is correct.So, after all this thinking, I believe that statement a) is correct, meaning the counterfeit can be identified in two weighings.**Final Answer**boxed{a}"},{"question":"An aquarium in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped has the following dimensions: length 1.5 meters, width 400 millimeters, and height 80 centimeters.

The length is given as 1.5 meters, which is 1500 millimeters. The width is already in millimeters at 400 mm, and the height is 80 centimeters, which converts to 800 millimeters.Next, I'll calculate the volume of the aquarium using the formula for the volume of a rectangular parallelepiped: Volume = Length × Width × Height. Plugging in the converted dimensions, the volume is 1500 mm × 400 mm × 800 mm, which equals 480,000,000 cubic millimeters.Since 1 liter is equivalent to 1,000,000 cubic millimeters, I can convert the volume to liters by dividing 480,000,000 mm³ by 1,000,000, resulting in 480 liters.The aquarium is being filled at a rate of 2 liters per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes to fill 480 liters, I'll divide the total volume by the filling rate: 480 liters ÷ 2 liters per minute = 240 minutes.Finally, to convert the filling time from minutes to seconds, I'll multiply by 60 seconds per minute: 240 minutes × 60 seconds = 14,400 seconds."},{"question":"Find the eleventh term of an arithmetic sequence, given that the sum of the first seven terms S_{7}=77 and the first term a_{1}=5.","answer":"To find the eleventh term of the arithmetic sequence, I'll start by recalling the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence:[S_n = frac{n}{2} times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)]Given that ( S_7 = 77 ) and ( a_1 = 5 ), I can substitute these values into the formula:[77 = frac{7}{2} times (2 times 5 + (7 - 1)d)]Simplifying inside the parentheses:[77 = frac{7}{2} times (10 + 6d)]Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:[154 = 7 times (10 + 6d)]Dividing both sides by 7:[22 = 10 + 6d]Subtracting 10 from both sides:[12 = 6d]Dividing both sides by 6:[d = 2]Now that I have the common difference ( d = 2 ), I can find the eleventh term using the formula for the ( n )-th term of an arithmetic sequence:[a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d]Substituting ( n = 11 ), ( a_1 = 5 ), and ( d = 2 ):[a_{11} = 5 + (11 - 1) times 2 = 5 + 20 = 25]"},{"question":"f(x) is a function with a period of 2.

I need to find (tan alpha). Hmm, let's see. I remember that (tan alpha) is (frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}), so maybe I can express everything in terms of sine and cosine to make it easier.Let me rewrite the equation:(3 frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} - sin alpha + 4 cos alpha = 12).Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can multiply both sides by (cos alpha) to eliminate the denominator. Let's try that:(3 sin alpha - sin alpha cos alpha + 4 cos^2 alpha = 12 cos alpha).Okay, now I have an equation with (sin alpha), (cos alpha), and (cos^2 alpha). I wonder if I can express everything in terms of one trigonometric function. Since I need to find (tan alpha), maybe I can let (t = tan alpha), which means (sin alpha = t cos alpha). Let me substitute that in.So, substituting (sin alpha = t cos alpha) into the equation:(3 (t cos alpha) - (t cos alpha) cos alpha + 4 cos^2 alpha = 12 cos alpha).Simplify each term:(3 t cos alpha - t cos^2 alpha + 4 cos^2 alpha = 12 cos alpha).Hmm, let's factor out (cos alpha) where possible:(cos alpha (3 t - t cos alpha + 4 cos alpha) = 12 cos alpha).Wait, that might not be the most straightforward way. Maybe I can collect like terms. Let me rewrite the equation:(3 t cos alpha - t cos^2 alpha + 4 cos^2 alpha - 12 cos alpha = 0).Factor out (cos alpha) from the first and last terms:(cos alpha (3 t - 12) + cos^2 alpha (-t + 4) = 0).Hmm, so we have (cos alpha (3 t - 12) + cos^2 alpha (4 - t) = 0). Maybe I can factor this differently or express it in terms of (cos alpha). Let me think.Alternatively, since I have (cos^2 alpha), I can use the identity (cos^2 alpha = 1 - sin^2 alpha), but since I already expressed (sin alpha) in terms of (t) and (cos alpha), maybe that's not helpful. Wait, actually, since I have (t = tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha}), I can express (sin alpha = t cos alpha), so (sin^2 alpha = t^2 cos^2 alpha). Therefore, (cos^2 alpha = frac{1}{1 + t^2}). Maybe that's a way to go.Let me try substituting (cos^2 alpha = frac{1}{1 + t^2}) into the equation. But first, let me write the equation again:(3 t cos alpha - t cos^2 alpha + 4 cos^2 alpha - 12 cos alpha = 0).Let me factor out (cos alpha):(cos alpha (3 t - 12) + cos^2 alpha (-t + 4) = 0).Now, let me express (cos alpha) in terms of (t). Since (cos alpha = frac{sin alpha}{t}), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since (cos^2 alpha = frac{1}{1 + t^2}), so (cos alpha = frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}}). Hmm, but that introduces square roots, which might complicate things. Maybe instead, let me express the entire equation in terms of (t).Let me denote (c = cos alpha), so the equation becomes:(3 t c - t c^2 + 4 c^2 - 12 c = 0).Factor out (c):(c (3 t - 12) + c^2 (-t + 4) = 0).So, (c (3 t - 12) + c^2 (4 - t) = 0).Let me factor out (c):(c [ (3 t - 12) + c (4 - t) ] = 0).So, either (c = 0) or the term in brackets is zero.Case 1: (c = 0). Then (cos alpha = 0), which implies (alpha = frac{pi}{2} + kpi). But then (tan alpha) is undefined, so this case is not possible because the original equation involves (tan alpha), which would be undefined. So we can disregard this case.Case 2: The term in brackets is zero:((3 t - 12) + c (4 - t) = 0).So, (3 t - 12 + c (4 - t) = 0).Let me solve for (c):(c (4 - t) = 12 - 3 t).Thus,(c = frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}).But we also know that (c = cos alpha), and since (tan alpha = t), we have:(cos alpha = frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}}).So,(frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} = frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}).Let me write this equation:(frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} = frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}).Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:(frac{1}{1 + t^2} = left( frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} right)^2).Simplify the right-hand side:First, factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: (12 - 3 t = 3 (4 - t)).Denominator: (4 - t).So,(frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} = frac{3 (4 - t)}{4 - t} = 3), provided that (4 - t neq 0), so (t neq 4).Wait, that's interesting. So,(frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} = 3), so squaring both sides gives:(frac{1}{1 + t^2} = 9).Thus,(1 = 9 (1 + t^2)).So,(1 = 9 + 9 t^2).Then,(9 t^2 = 1 - 9 = -8).But (9 t^2 = -8) implies (t^2 = -frac{8}{9}), which is impossible since (t^2) cannot be negative.Hmm, that suggests that our assumption might be wrong somewhere. Let me check.We had:(c = frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}).But (c = cos alpha = frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}}).So, substituting, we get:(frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} = frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}).But when I simplified (frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}), I factored out a 3:(frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} = frac{3 (4 - t)}{4 - t} = 3), provided (4 - t neq 0).But if (4 - t = 0), which is (t = 4), then the original fraction is undefined, so we have to consider (t neq 4).But in that case, (frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} = 3), so then:(frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} = 3).Which implies:(sqrt{1 + t^2} = frac{1}{3}).Squaring both sides:(1 + t^2 = frac{1}{9}).Thus,(t^2 = frac{1}{9} - 1 = -frac{8}{9}).Again, negative, which is impossible.Hmm, so this suggests that there is no solution? But the original equation was given, so maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, let's go back.Original equation:(3 tan alpha - sin alpha + 4 cos alpha = 12).I set (t = tan alpha), so (sin alpha = t cos alpha).Then, substituting:(3 t - t cos alpha + 4 cos alpha = 12).Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake earlier when substituting. Let me redo that step.Original equation after multiplying both sides by (cos alpha):(3 sin alpha - sin alpha cos alpha + 4 cos^2 alpha = 12 cos alpha).But since (sin alpha = t cos alpha), substituting:(3 (t cos alpha) - (t cos alpha)(cos alpha) + 4 cos^2 alpha = 12 cos alpha).Simplify:(3 t cos alpha - t cos^2 alpha + 4 cos^2 alpha = 12 cos alpha).Bring all terms to one side:(3 t cos alpha - t cos^2 alpha + 4 cos^2 alpha - 12 cos alpha = 0).Factor out (cos alpha):(cos alpha (3 t - 12) + cos^2 alpha (-t + 4) = 0).So, that's correct. Then, as before, we have:(cos alpha (3 t - 12) + cos^2 alpha (4 - t) = 0).Then, factoring out (cos alpha):(cos alpha [ (3 t - 12) + cos alpha (4 - t) ] = 0).So, either (cos alpha = 0) or the bracket is zero.As before, (cos alpha = 0) leads to undefined (tan alpha), so we discard that.Thus, the bracket must be zero:(3 t - 12 + cos alpha (4 - t) = 0).So, solving for (cos alpha):(cos alpha = frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}).But (cos alpha = frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}}), so:(frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} = frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}).So, cross-multiplying:(4 - t = (12 - 3 t) sqrt{1 + t^2}).Wait, that's different from before. I think I made a mistake in the previous step when I simplified (frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}) as 3. Let me check:(frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} = frac{3(4 - t)}{4 - t} = 3), only if (4 - t neq 0). But if (4 - t = 0), then the expression is undefined. So, if (t neq 4), then (frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} = 3), but if (t = 4), it's undefined.But in our case, (t = tan alpha), which can be any real number except where (cos alpha = 0). So, (t) can be 4, but in that case, the expression (frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}) would be (frac{12 - 12}{0}), which is undefined. So, perhaps (t = 4) is a special case.Wait, let me consider (t = 4). If (t = 4), then (tan alpha = 4), so (sin alpha = 4 cos alpha). Then, let's substitute back into the original equation:(3 tan alpha - sin alpha + 4 cos alpha = 12).So,(3 * 4 - 4 cos alpha + 4 cos alpha = 12).Simplify:(12 - 4 cos alpha + 4 cos alpha = 12).Which simplifies to:(12 = 12).So, that's always true. Hmm, interesting. So, if (t = 4), the equation is satisfied for any (cos alpha). But we also have the identity (sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1). Since (sin alpha = 4 cos alpha), substituting:((4 cos alpha)^2 + cos^2 alpha = 1).So,(16 cos^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1).Thus,(17 cos^2 alpha = 1).So,(cos^2 alpha = frac{1}{17}).Therefore,(cos alpha = pm frac{1}{sqrt{17}}).But in the original equation, we have (tan alpha = 4), which is positive, so (alpha) is in the first or third quadrant. However, in the third quadrant, both (sin alpha) and (cos alpha) are negative, but (tan alpha) is positive. However, let's check if the original equation holds.Wait, if (cos alpha = frac{1}{sqrt{17}}), then (sin alpha = frac{4}{sqrt{17}}), and substituting back into the original equation:(3 tan alpha - sin alpha + 4 cos alpha = 3*4 - frac{4}{sqrt{17}} + 4*frac{1}{sqrt{17}} = 12 - frac{4}{sqrt{17}} + frac{4}{sqrt{17}} = 12). So, it works.If (cos alpha = -frac{1}{sqrt{17}}), then (sin alpha = -frac{4}{sqrt{17}}), and substituting back:(3 tan alpha - sin alpha + 4 cos alpha = 3*4 - (-frac{4}{sqrt{17}}) + 4*(-frac{1}{sqrt{17}}) = 12 + frac{4}{sqrt{17}} - frac{4}{sqrt{17}} = 12). So, it also works.Therefore, (t = 4) is a valid solution.But earlier, when I tried to solve for (t) by squaring, I ended up with an impossible equation, which suggests that (t = 4) is the only solution, and the other approach led to a contradiction, meaning no other solutions exist.Wait, but let me check again.When I had:(frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} = frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}).I thought that (frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} = 3), but actually, that's only if (4 - t neq 0). So, if (t neq 4), then (frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t} = 3), which leads to (frac{1}{sqrt{1 + t^2}} = 3), which is impossible as before.But if (t = 4), then (frac{12 - 3 t}{4 - t}) is undefined, but in reality, when (t = 4), the equation is satisfied as we saw earlier.Therefore, the only solution is (t = 4).So, (tan alpha = 4).Let me just verify this once more.If (tan alpha = 4), then (sin alpha = frac{4}{sqrt{17}}) and (cos alpha = frac{1}{sqrt{17}}) (or negative, but as we saw, both cases work).Substituting into the original equation:(3 tan alpha - sin alpha + 4 cos alpha = 3*4 - frac{4}{sqrt{17}} + 4*frac{1}{sqrt{17}} = 12 - frac{4}{sqrt{17}} + frac{4}{sqrt{17}} = 12).Yes, that works. So, the solution is (tan alpha = 4).I think that's it. So, the answer is 4.**Final Answer**The value of (operatorname{tg} alpha) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Simplify the product [frac{8}{4}cdotfrac{12}{8}cdotfrac{16}{12} dotsm frac{4n+4}{4n} dotsm frac{2008}{2004}.]","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to simplify a product of fractions. The product is written as (8/4) multiplied by (12/8) multiplied by (16/12) and so on, up to (2008/2004). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here.First, let me write down the product to see if I can spot a pattern or something. So, it's:(8/4) * (12/8) * (16/12) * ... * (4n+4)/(4n) * ... * (2008/2004)Hmm, each fraction seems to follow a pattern where the numerator is 4 more than the denominator. Let me check:8 is 4 more than 4, 12 is 4 more than 8, 16 is 4 more than 12, and so on. So each numerator is the previous denominator plus 4. That seems consistent.So, if I write each fraction as (4k + 4)/(4k), where k starts at 1 and goes up. Let me check:When k=1: (4*1 + 4)/(4*1) = 8/4k=2: (4*2 + 4)/(4*2) = 12/8k=3: (4*3 + 4)/(4*3) = 16/12Yep, that works. So the general term is (4(k+1))/4k, right? Because 4k + 4 is 4(k + 1). So each term simplifies to (k + 1)/k.Wait, so each fraction is (k + 1)/k. So the entire product is the product of (k + 1)/k for k from 1 to some number. Let me see.But wait, the last term is 2008/2004. Let me express that in terms of k. So, 2008 is 4(k + 1), so 4(k + 1) = 2008, so k + 1 = 2008 / 4 = 502, so k = 501. So the product goes from k=1 to k=501.Therefore, the product is the product from k=1 to k=501 of (k + 1)/k.Hmm, okay, so that's (2/1) * (3/2) * (4/3) * ... * (502/501). Wait a second, that's a telescoping product, right? Because each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next term.Let me write out the first few terms:(2/1) * (3/2) * (4/3) * (5/4) * ... * (502/501)So, the 2 in the numerator cancels with the 2 in the denominator of the next term, the 3 cancels with the 3, and so on, all the way up to 501. So, everything cancels except the first denominator and the last numerator.So, the entire product simplifies to 502/1, which is just 502.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting with k=1, each term is (k+1)/k, so the product is telescoping, and the result is (502)/1, which is 502.But let me double-check the number of terms to make sure I didn't miscalculate k.The last term is 2008/2004, which is (4*502)/(4*501), so yeah, k=501. So the product is from k=1 to k=501, so 501 terms. But when you multiply all those telescoping terms, you end up with 502/1.Wait, but let me think again. If I have n terms, each term is (k+1)/k, starting at k=1, so the product is (2/1)*(3/2)*(4/3)*...*((n+1)/n) = (n+1)/1.So, in this case, n is 501, so the product is 502/1 = 502.Wait, but let me check the first term. The first term is 8/4, which is 2/1, right? So when k=1, (4*1 + 4)/(4*1) = 8/4 = 2/1. So that's correct.So, yeah, the product telescopes down to 502. So the answer should be 502.But just to make sure, let me compute a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds.Suppose I have the product up to, say, 16/12. So that would be (8/4)*(12/8)*(16/12). Let's compute that:(8/4) = 2(12/8) = 1.5(16/12) ≈ 1.333...Multiplying them together: 2 * 1.5 = 3, then 3 * 1.333... ≈ 4.Alternatively, using the telescoping method: the product is (2/1)*(3/2)*(4/3) = 4/1 = 4. Which matches.So, in that smaller case, it works. So, applying the same logic, the larger product should also telescope down to 502.Therefore, I think the simplified product is 502.**Final Answer**boxed{502}"},{"question":"From May 1st to May 3rd, the provincial hospital plans to schedule 6 doctors to be on duty, with each person working 1 day and 2 people scheduled per day. Given that doctor A cannot work on the 2nd and doctor B cannot work on the 3rd, how many different scheduling arrangements are possible?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many different ways to schedule 6 doctors over 3 days (May 1st to May 3rd). Each day, 2 doctors are on duty, and each doctor works only one day. But there are some constraints: Doctor A can't work on the 2nd, and Doctor B can't work on the 3rd. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, without any constraints, how many ways can we schedule 6 doctors into 3 days with 2 each day? Well, that's a classic combinatorial problem. It's like partitioning 6 distinct objects into 3 groups of 2. The formula for that is 6! divided by (2! * 2! * 2!) because each day's pair is indistinct in terms of order. So that would be 720 / (8) = 90 ways. But of course, we have constraints, so this number will be less.Now, let's consider the constraints. Doctor A can't work on the 2nd, and Doctor B can't work on the 3rd. So, I need to subtract the arrangements where Doctor A is on the 2nd or Doctor B is on the 3rd. But wait, I have to be careful because some arrangements might violate both constraints, and I don't want to subtract those twice. So, this sounds like an inclusion-exclusion principle problem.Let me define two sets:- Set X: All schedules where Doctor A is on the 2nd.- Set Y: All schedules where Doctor B is on the 3rd.We need to find the total number of valid schedules, which is the total number without constraints minus the number of schedules in X or Y.So, using inclusion-exclusion, the number of invalid schedules is |X| + |Y| - |X ∩ Y|.First, let's compute |X|: the number of schedules where Doctor A is on the 2nd. If Doctor A is fixed on the 2nd, then we need to choose one more doctor to join Doctor A on the 2nd. There are 5 other doctors, so 5 choices. Then, we have 4 doctors left to schedule on the 1st and 3rd. Each day needs 2 doctors, so it's like partitioning 4 doctors into two groups of 2. That would be 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6 ways. So, |X| = 5 * 6 = 30.Next, |Y|: the number of schedules where Doctor B is on the 3rd. Similarly, if Doctor B is fixed on the 3rd, we choose one more doctor to join Doctor B, which can be any of the remaining 5 doctors. Then, we have 4 doctors left for the 1st and 2nd days, which is again 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6 ways. So, |Y| = 5 * 6 = 30.Now, |X ∩ Y|: the number of schedules where Doctor A is on the 2nd AND Doctor B is on the 3rd. So, both constraints are violated. Let's compute this. Doctor A is on the 2nd, Doctor B is on the 3rd. So, on the 2nd, we need one more doctor besides A, and on the 3rd, one more besides B. The remaining doctors are 4: let's call them C, D, E, F.We need to assign one more doctor to the 2nd day and one more to the 3rd day, and the remaining two will be on the 1st day. So, first, choose 1 doctor out of 4 to join A on the 2nd. That's 4 choices. Then, choose 1 doctor out of the remaining 3 to join B on the 3rd. That's 3 choices. The last 2 doctors will automatically be on the 1st day. So, the number of ways is 4 * 3 = 12.Therefore, |X ∩ Y| = 12.Putting it all together, the number of invalid schedules is |X| + |Y| - |X ∩ Y| = 30 + 30 - 12 = 48.So, the total number of valid schedules is the total without constraints minus invalid schedules: 90 - 48 = 42.Wait, but let me double-check this because sometimes inclusion-exclusion can be tricky.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem directly by considering the constraints.Let me think about assigning doctors to each day, making sure that A isn't on the 2nd and B isn't on the 3rd.We have 3 days: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.Each day needs 2 doctors.Total doctors: 6, including A and B.So, let's consider the possible assignments for A and B first, then assign the remaining doctors.Case 1: Doctor A is on the 1st or 3rd.Case 2: Doctor B is on the 1st or 2nd.But since A can't be on the 2nd and B can't be on the 3rd, their possible days are restricted.Let me try to compute the number of valid assignments by considering the possible days for A and B.First, assign Doctor A: A can be on day 1 or day 3.Similarly, assign Doctor B: B can be on day 1 or day 2.So, let's break it down into subcases based on where A and B are assigned.Subcase 1: A is on day 1, B is on day 1.Subcase 2: A is on day 1, B is on day 2.Subcase 3: A is on day 3, B is on day 1.Subcase 4: A is on day 3, B is on day 2.Let me compute each subcase.Subcase 1: A and B are both on day 1.Then, day 1 has A and B. Then, we need to assign 2 doctors to day 2 and 2 to day 3 from the remaining 4 doctors (C, D, E, F).The number of ways to partition 4 doctors into two groups of 2 is 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.But wait, we also need to consider the order of days? No, because the days are fixed (day 2 and day 3). So, it's just 6 ways.Subcase 2: A is on day 1, B is on day 2.So, day 1 has A and someone else, day 2 has B and someone else, and day 3 has the remaining two.First, choose who joins A on day 1: 4 choices (since B is already assigned to day 2).Then, choose who joins B on day 2: 3 choices (since A is on day 1 and one doctor is already chosen for day 1).Then, the remaining 2 doctors go to day 3. So, the number of ways is 4 * 3 = 12.Subcase 3: A is on day 3, B is on day 1.Similar to Subcase 2.Day 3 has A and someone else, day 1 has B and someone else, day 2 has the remaining two.Choose who joins A on day 3: 4 choices.Choose who joins B on day 1: 3 choices.So, 4 * 3 = 12.Subcase 4: A is on day 3, B is on day 2.So, day 3 has A and someone else, day 2 has B and someone else, day 1 has the remaining two.Choose who joins A on day 3: 4 choices.Choose who joins B on day 2: 3 choices.So, 4 * 3 = 12.Now, let's add up all the subcases:Subcase 1: 6Subcase 2: 12Subcase 3: 12Subcase 4: 12Total: 6 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 42.Hmm, same result as before. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way is to calculate the total number of ways without constraints, which is 90, and subtract the invalid ones, which we found to be 48, giving 42.So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.Therefore, the number of different scheduling arrangements possible is 42.**Final Answer**The number of different scheduling arrangements possible is boxed{42}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=4cos omega xcos (omega x+ frac{pi}{3} ), where omega > 0, the smallest positive period is pi.(1) Find the value of omega;(2) Discuss the monotonicity of f(x) in the interval left[0, frac{5pi}{6} right].","answer":"Alright, so I've got this function here: ( f(x) = 4cos omega x cos left( omega x + frac{pi}{3} right) ).

For cosine functions, the standard period is ( 2pi ), but when there's a coefficient inside the cosine, like ( cos(kx) ), the period becomes ( frac{2pi}{k} ).Looking at ( f(x) ), it's a product of two cosine functions: ( 4cos omega x ) and ( cos left( omega x + frac{pi}{3} right) ). So, each of these has a period of ( frac{2pi}{omega} ). But when you multiply two periodic functions together, the resulting function's period is the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual periods. In this case, since both have the same period ( frac{2pi}{omega} ), the LCM is just that same period.But wait, the problem states that the smallest positive period is ( pi ). So, that must mean that ( frac{2pi}{omega} = pi ). Let me write that down:( frac{2pi}{omega} = pi )To solve for ( omega ), I can divide both sides by ( pi ):( frac{2}{omega} = 1 )Then, multiplying both sides by ( omega ):( 2 = omega )So, ( omega = 2 ). Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check. If ( omega = 2 ), then each cosine term has a period of ( frac{2pi}{2} = pi ), so the product should also have a period of ( pi ). That makes sense because if both functions repeat every ( pi ), their product will too. So, I think that's correct.Moving on to part (2), I need to discuss the monotonicity of ( f(x) ) in the interval ( left[0, frac{5pi}{6} right] ). Monotonicity refers to where the function is increasing or decreasing. To find this, I should first find the derivative of ( f(x) ) and analyze its sign.But before taking the derivative, maybe I can simplify ( f(x) ) using a trigonometric identity. I recall that the product of cosines can be expressed as a sum using the identity:( cos A cos B = frac{1}{2} [cos(A - B) + cos(A + B)] )Let me apply this identity to ( f(x) ):( f(x) = 4 cos omega x cos left( omega x + frac{pi}{3} right) )Let ( A = omega x ) and ( B = omega x + frac{pi}{3} ). Then,( f(x) = 4 times frac{1}{2} [cos(A - B) + cos(A + B)] )Simplify:( f(x) = 2 [cos(-frac{pi}{3}) + cos(2omega x + frac{pi}{3})] )Since ( cos(-theta) = cos theta ), this becomes:( f(x) = 2 [cos(frac{pi}{3}) + cos(2omega x + frac{pi}{3})] )We know that ( cos(frac{pi}{3}) = frac{1}{2} ), so:( f(x) = 2 left[ frac{1}{2} + cos(2omega x + frac{pi}{3}) right] )Simplify further:( f(x) = 2 times frac{1}{2} + 2 cos(2omega x + frac{pi}{3}) )( f(x) = 1 + 2 cos(2omega x + frac{pi}{3}) )Okay, so ( f(x) ) simplifies to ( 1 + 2 cos(2omega x + frac{pi}{3}) ). Since we found ( omega = 2 ) in part (1), let's substitute that in:( f(x) = 1 + 2 cos(4x + frac{pi}{3}) )Now, to find the monotonicity, I need the derivative ( f'(x) ). Let's compute that:( f'(x) = frac{d}{dx} [1 + 2 cos(4x + frac{pi}{3})] )The derivative of 1 is 0, and the derivative of ( 2 cos(u) ) is ( -2 sin(u) times u' ). So,( f'(x) = -2 sin(4x + frac{pi}{3}) times 4 )Simplify:( f'(x) = -8 sin(4x + frac{pi}{3}) )So, ( f'(x) = -8 sin(4x + frac{pi}{3}) ). To determine where ( f(x) ) is increasing or decreasing, we need to analyze the sign of ( f'(x) ).First, let's find the critical points by setting ( f'(x) = 0 ):( -8 sin(4x + frac{pi}{3}) = 0 )Divide both sides by -8:( sin(4x + frac{pi}{3}) = 0 )The sine function is zero at integer multiples of ( pi ):( 4x + frac{pi}{3} = kpi ), where ( k ) is an integer.Solving for ( x ):( 4x = kpi - frac{pi}{3} )( x = frac{kpi}{4} - frac{pi}{12} )Simplify:( x = frac{(3k - 1)pi}{12} )So, the critical points are at ( x = frac{(3k - 1)pi}{12} ). Now, let's find all critical points within the interval ( left[0, frac{5pi}{6} right] ).We need to find integers ( k ) such that ( 0 leq frac{(3k - 1)pi}{12} leq frac{5pi}{6} ).Multiply all parts by 12:( 0 leq (3k - 1)pi leq 10pi )Divide by ( pi ):( 0 leq 3k - 1 leq 10 )Add 1:( 1 leq 3k leq 11 )Divide by 3:( frac{1}{3} leq k leq frac{11}{3} )Since ( k ) must be an integer, the possible values are ( k = 1, 2, 3 ).Let's compute the critical points for these ( k ):For ( k = 1 ):( x = frac{(3(1) - 1)pi}{12} = frac{2pi}{12} = frac{pi}{6} )For ( k = 2 ):( x = frac{(3(2) - 1)pi}{12} = frac{5pi}{12} )For ( k = 3 ):( x = frac{(3(3) - 1)pi}{12} = frac{8pi}{12} = frac{2pi}{3} )So, the critical points in the interval ( [0, frac{5pi}{6}] ) are ( x = frac{pi}{6} ), ( x = frac{5pi}{12} ), and ( x = frac{2pi}{3} ).Now, we need to test the sign of ( f'(x) ) in each subinterval determined by these critical points. The intervals are:1. ( [0, frac{pi}{6}] )2. ( [frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{12}] )3. ( [frac{5pi}{12}, frac{2pi}{3}] )4. ( [frac{2pi}{3}, frac{5pi}{6}] )Let's pick test points in each interval.1. First interval: ( [0, frac{pi}{6}] ). Let's choose ( x = 0 ).2. Second interval: ( [frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{12}] ). Let's choose ( x = frac{pi}{4} ).3. Third interval: ( [frac{5pi}{12}, frac{2pi}{3}] ). Let's choose ( x = frac{7pi}{12} ).4. Fourth interval: ( [frac{2pi}{3}, frac{5pi}{6}] ). Let's choose ( x = frac{3pi}{4} ).Compute ( f'(x) ) at each test point.1. At ( x = 0 ):( f'(0) = -8 sin(4(0) + frac{pi}{3}) = -8 sin(frac{pi}{3}) )( sin(frac{pi}{3}) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), so:( f'(0) = -8 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -4sqrt{3} ), which is negative. So, ( f(x) ) is decreasing on ( [0, frac{pi}{6}] ).2. At ( x = frac{pi}{4} ):( f'(frac{pi}{4}) = -8 sin(4(frac{pi}{4}) + frac{pi}{3}) = -8 sin(pi + frac{pi}{3}) )( sin(pi + frac{pi}{3}) = sin(frac{4pi}{3}) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} )So,( f'(frac{pi}{4}) = -8 times (-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) = 4sqrt{3} ), which is positive. Therefore, ( f(x) ) is increasing on ( [frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{12}] ).3. At ( x = frac{7pi}{12} ):( f'(frac{7pi}{12}) = -8 sin(4(frac{7pi}{12}) + frac{pi}{3}) )Compute the argument:( 4 times frac{7pi}{12} = frac{28pi}{12} = frac{7pi}{3} )So,( frac{7pi}{3} + frac{pi}{3} = frac{8pi}{3} )But ( frac{8pi}{3} ) is more than ( 2pi ), so subtract ( 2pi ):( frac{8pi}{3} - 2pi = frac{8pi}{3} - frac{6pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{3} )Thus,( sin(frac{8pi}{3}) = sin(frac{2pi}{3}) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} )So,( f'(frac{7pi}{12}) = -8 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -4sqrt{3} ), which is negative. Therefore, ( f(x) ) is decreasing on ( [frac{5pi}{12}, frac{2pi}{3}] ).4. At ( x = frac{3pi}{4} ):( f'(frac{3pi}{4}) = -8 sin(4(frac{3pi}{4}) + frac{pi}{3}) = -8 sin(3pi + frac{pi}{3}) )( sin(3pi + frac{pi}{3}) = sin(pi + frac{pi}{3} + 2pi) = sin(frac{4pi}{3}) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} )So,( f'(frac{3pi}{4}) = -8 times (-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) = 4sqrt{3} ), which is positive. Therefore, ( f(x) ) is increasing on ( [frac{2pi}{3}, frac{5pi}{6}] ).Putting it all together:- On ( [0, frac{pi}{6}] ), ( f(x) ) is decreasing.- On ( [frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{12}] ), ( f(x) ) is increasing.- On ( [frac{5pi}{12}, frac{2pi}{3}] ), ( f(x) ) is decreasing.- On ( [frac{2pi}{3}, frac{5pi}{6}] ), ( f(x) ) is increasing.So, summarizing the monotonicity:- Decreasing from 0 to ( frac{pi}{6} )- Increasing from ( frac{pi}{6} ) to ( frac{5pi}{12} )- Decreasing from ( frac{5pi}{12} ) to ( frac{2pi}{3} )- Increasing from ( frac{2pi}{3} ) to ( frac{5pi}{6} )Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the critical points or the test points.Wait, when I computed ( f'(x) ) at ( x = frac{7pi}{12} ), I had:( 4x = 4 times frac{7pi}{12} = frac{28pi}{12} = frac{7pi}{3} ). Then, adding ( frac{pi}{3} ), it's ( frac{8pi}{3} ). Since ( frac{8pi}{3} ) is more than ( 2pi ), subtracting ( 2pi ) gives ( frac{2pi}{3} ). So, ( sin(frac{8pi}{3}) = sin(frac{2pi}{3}) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ). That seems correct.Similarly, for ( x = frac{3pi}{4} ):( 4x = 3pi ), so ( 4x + frac{pi}{3} = 3pi + frac{pi}{3} = frac{10pi}{3} ). Subtracting ( 2pi ) gives ( frac{10pi}{3} - 2pi = frac{10pi}{3} - frac{6pi}{3} = frac{4pi}{3} ). So, ( sin(frac{4pi}{3}) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ). So, the derivative is positive. That's correct.I think my calculations are correct. So, the function alternates between decreasing and increasing in each subinterval, with critical points at ( frac{pi}{6} ), ( frac{5pi}{12} ), and ( frac{2pi}{3} ).Therefore, the monotonicity discussion is as above.**Final Answer**(1) (boxed{2})(2) The function ( f(x) ) is decreasing on ( left[0, frac{pi}{6}right] ), increasing on ( left[frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{12}right] ), decreasing on ( left[frac{5pi}{12}, frac{2pi}{3}right] ), and increasing on ( left[frac{2pi}{3}, frac{5pi}{6}right] )."},{"question":"If ( x_{1} ) and ( x_{2} ) are the roots of the equationfrac{3a-b}{c} x^{2} + frac{c(3a+b)}{3a-b} = 0then, without solving it, find ( x_{1}^{117} + x_{2}^{117} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation:frac{3a - b}{c} x^{2} + frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b} = 0And I need to find ( x_{1}^{117} + x_{2}^{117} ) without solving the equation. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me think step by step.First, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots ( x_1 + x_2 ) is equal to ( -b/a ) and the product ( x_1 x_2 ) is ( c/a ). Maybe I can use that here.But wait, the given equation doesn't look exactly like the standard quadratic form. Let me rewrite it to make it clearer.The equation is:frac{3a - b}{c} x^{2} + frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b} = 0So, comparing this to the standard quadratic ( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 ), I can see that:- The coefficient ( A ) is ( frac{3a - b}{c} )- The coefficient ( B ) is 0 because there's no ( x ) term.- The constant term ( C ) is ( frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b} )Wait, so actually, the equation is:frac{3a - b}{c} x^{2} + 0 cdot x + frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b} = 0So, in standard form, that's:A x^2 + C = 0Which means it's a quadratic equation without the linear term. That simplifies things a bit.So, the sum of the roots ( x_1 + x_2 = -B/A = 0 ) because ( B = 0 ). So, the sum of the roots is zero.And the product of the roots ( x_1 x_2 = C/A ). Let me compute that.First, ( C = frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b} ) and ( A = frac{3a - b}{c} ). So,x_1 x_2 = frac{C}{A} = frac{frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b}}{frac{3a - b}{c}} = frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b} times frac{c}{3a - b} = frac{c^2 (3a + b)}{(3a - b)^2}So, ( x_1 x_2 = frac{c^2 (3a + b)}{(3a - b)^2} ).Now, I need to find ( x_1^{117} + x_2^{117} ). That's a high power, but maybe I can find a pattern or use some properties of the roots.Since the equation is quadratic, I can use the recurrence relation for powers of roots. For a quadratic equation ( x^2 + px + q = 0 ), the powers of the roots satisfy the relation:x_n = -p x_{n-1} - q x_{n-2}But in our case, the quadratic equation is ( A x^2 + C = 0 ), so it can be rewritten as:x^2 + frac{C}{A} = 0Which is:x^2 + left( frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b} times frac{c}{3a - b} right) = 0Wait, that's the same as:x^2 + frac{c^2 (3a + b)}{(3a - b)^2} = 0So, comparing to ( x^2 + p x + q = 0 ), we have ( p = 0 ) and ( q = frac{c^2 (3a + b)}{(3a - b)^2} ).Therefore, the recurrence relation becomes:x_n = -0 cdot x_{n-1} - q x_{n-2} = - q x_{n-2}So, each term is just ( -q ) times the term two places before it.That's interesting. So, starting from ( x_0 ) and ( x_1 ), we can compute higher powers.But wait, actually, in the context of power sums, we have:Let ( S_n = x_1^n + x_2^n ). Then, the recurrence relation for ( S_n ) is:S_n = -p S_{n-1} - q S_{n-2}But since ( p = 0 ), this simplifies to:S_n = - q S_{n-2}So, ( S_n = - q S_{n-2} )That's a useful recurrence. So, if I can find ( S_0 ), ( S_1 ), then I can compute ( S_2, S_3, ) etc., up to ( S_{117} ).Let me compute ( S_0 ) and ( S_1 ).First, ( S_0 = x_1^0 + x_2^0 = 1 + 1 = 2 ).Next, ( S_1 = x_1 + x_2 = 0 ) because the sum of the roots is zero.So, ( S_0 = 2 ), ( S_1 = 0 ).Now, using the recurrence ( S_n = - q S_{n-2} ), let's compute ( S_2 ):( S_2 = - q S_0 = - q times 2 )But ( q = frac{c^2 (3a + b)}{(3a - b)^2} ), so:( S_2 = -2 times frac{c^2 (3a + b)}{(3a - b)^2} )Similarly, ( S_3 = - q S_1 = - q times 0 = 0 )( S_4 = - q S_2 = - q times (-2 q) = 2 q^2 )( S_5 = - q S_3 = - q times 0 = 0 )( S_6 = - q S_4 = - q times 2 q^2 = -2 q^3 )( S_7 = - q S_5 = - q times 0 = 0 )Hmm, I see a pattern here.Looking at the sequence:- ( S_0 = 2 )- ( S_1 = 0 )- ( S_2 = -2 q )- ( S_3 = 0 )- ( S_4 = 2 q^2 )- ( S_5 = 0 )- ( S_6 = -2 q^3 )- ( S_7 = 0 )- ...So, every odd term is zero, and the even terms alternate between positive and negative multiples of ( q ) raised to increasing powers.Specifically, for even ( n = 2k ), ( S_{2k} = (-1)^k 2 q^k ).Let me verify that.For ( k = 0 ): ( S_0 = (-1)^0 2 q^0 = 2 times 1 = 2 ) ✔️For ( k = 1 ): ( S_2 = (-1)^1 2 q^1 = -2 q ) ✔️For ( k = 2 ): ( S_4 = (-1)^2 2 q^2 = 2 q^2 ) ✔️For ( k = 3 ): ( S_6 = (-1)^3 2 q^3 = -2 q^3 ) ✔️Yes, that seems to hold.Therefore, in general, for ( n = 2k ), ( S_n = (-1)^k 2 q^k ).Since 117 is an odd number, ( S_{117} = 0 ). Wait, is that right?Wait, 117 divided by 2 is 58.5, so it's not an integer. So, 117 is odd, so ( S_{117} = 0 ).But let me double-check.Looking back at the pattern:- ( S_1 = 0 )- ( S_3 = 0 )- ( S_5 = 0 )- ...So, every odd power sum is zero. Therefore, ( S_{117} = 0 ).Wait, but let me think again. Is that necessarily the case?Because the recurrence is ( S_n = - q S_{n-2} ). So, starting from ( S_0 = 2 ) and ( S_1 = 0 ), then:- ( S_2 = - q S_0 = -2 q )- ( S_3 = - q S_1 = 0 )- ( S_4 = - q S_2 = 2 q^2 )- ( S_5 = - q S_3 = 0 )- ( S_6 = - q S_4 = -2 q^3 )- ( S_7 = - q S_5 = 0 )- ...So, indeed, every odd ( S_n ) is zero. Therefore, ( S_{117} = 0 ).But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The equation is ( x^2 + q = 0 ), so the roots are ( x = pm sqrt{-q} ). So, ( x_1 = sqrt{-q} ) and ( x_2 = -sqrt{-q} ). Therefore, ( x_1^n + x_2^n ) would be ( (sqrt{-q})^n + (-sqrt{-q})^n ).If ( n ) is even, say ( n = 2k ), then:( x_1^{2k} + x_2^{2k} = (sqrt{-q})^{2k} + (-sqrt{-q})^{2k} = (-q)^k + (-q)^k = 2 (-q)^k )If ( n ) is odd, say ( n = 2k + 1 ), then:( x_1^{2k+1} + x_2^{2k+1} = (sqrt{-q})^{2k+1} + (-sqrt{-q})^{2k+1} = (-q)^k sqrt{-q} + (-1)^{2k+1} (-q)^k sqrt{-q} )Simplify:( (-q)^k sqrt{-q} - (-q)^k sqrt{-q} = 0 )So, yes, for odd exponents, the sum is zero. Therefore, ( S_{117} = 0 ).Therefore, the answer is 0.But just to make sure, let me recap.Given the quadratic equation ( frac{3a - b}{c} x^2 + frac{c(3a + b)}{3a - b} = 0 ), we can rewrite it as ( x^2 + q = 0 ) where ( q = frac{c^2 (3a + b)}{(3a - b)^2} ). The roots are ( sqrt{-q} ) and ( -sqrt{-q} ). Therefore, any odd power of the roots will cancel out, giving zero. Hence, ( x_1^{117} + x_2^{117} = 0 ).I think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the answer is zero.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"Solve the following equation:left(frac{3}{4}right)^{lg x}+left(frac{4}{3}right)^{lg x}=frac{25}{12}","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: left(frac{3}{4}right)^{lg x} + left(frac{4}{3}right)^{lg x} = frac{25}{12}Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with equations involving exponents, sometimes substitution can help simplify things. The terms here are both raised to the power of lg x, which is the logarithm base 10 of x. First, let me denote y = lg x. That should make the equation a bit cleaner. So substituting, the equation becomes:left(frac{3}{4}right)^y + left(frac{4}{3}right)^y = frac{25}{12}Alright, now I have an equation in terms of y. Let me see if I can express both terms with the same base or relate them somehow. Notice that frac{4}{3} is the reciprocal of frac{3}{4}. So, left(frac{4}{3}right)^y is the same as left(frac{3}{4}right)^{-y}. So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:left(frac{3}{4}right)^y + left(frac{3}{4}right)^{-y} = frac{25}{12}Hmm, this looks like an equation of the form a^y + a^{-y} = k, which is a common form. I recall that such equations can often be transformed into quadratic equations by using substitution. Let me set t = left(frac{3}{4}right)^y. Then, left(frac{3}{4}right)^{-y} is just frac{1}{t}. Substituting these into the equation, I get:t + frac{1}{t} = frac{25}{12}To eliminate the fraction, I can multiply both sides by t:t^2 + 1 = frac{25}{12}tNow, bringing all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:t^2 - frac{25}{12}t + 1 = 0Hmm, quadratic in t. Let me write that as:12t^2 - 25t + 12 = 0Multiplying both sides by 12 to eliminate the fraction. Wait, actually, if I have t^2 - frac{25}{12}t + 1 = 0, multiplying all terms by 12 gives:12t^2 - 25t + 12 = 0Yes, that's correct. Now, let's try to solve this quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic formula is:t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}Where in this case, a = 12, b = -25, and c = 12. Plugging these into the formula:First, compute the discriminant:b^2 - 4ac = (-25)^2 - 4 times 12 times 12 = 625 - 576 = 49Oh, nice, the discriminant is 49, which is a perfect square. So, the solutions will be rational. Now, compute the roots:t = frac{-(-25) pm sqrt{49}}{2 times 12} = frac{25 pm 7}{24}So, two solutions:1. t = frac{25 + 7}{24} = frac{32}{24} = frac{4}{3}2. t = frac{25 - 7}{24} = frac{18}{24} = frac{3}{4}So, t = frac{4}{3} or t = frac{3}{4}. But remember, t = left(frac{3}{4}right)^y. So, let's write that:Case 1: left(frac{3}{4}right)^y = frac{4}{3}Case 2: left(frac{3}{4}right)^y = frac{3}{4}Let me solve each case separately.Starting with Case 1:left(frac{3}{4}right)^y = frac{4}{3}I can rewrite the right-hand side as left(frac{3}{4}right)^{-1} because frac{4}{3} = left(frac{3}{4}right)^{-1}. Therefore:left(frac{3}{4}right)^y = left(frac{3}{4}right)^{-1}Since the bases are equal and greater than 0 and not equal to 1, the exponents must be equal. So:y = -1Case 2:left(frac{3}{4}right)^y = frac{3}{4}Similarly, the right-hand side is left(frac{3}{4}right)^1, so:left(frac{3}{4}right)^y = left(frac{3}{4}right)^1Again, since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal:y = 1So, from both cases, we have y = -1 or y = 1.But remember, we set y = lg x. So, now we can solve for x.Case 1: y = -1lg x = -1Which means:x = 10^{-1} = frac{1}{10}Case 2: y = 1lg x = 1Which means:x = 10^{1} = 10So, the solutions are x = frac{1}{10} and x = 10.Let me just verify these solutions to make sure they satisfy the original equation.First, test x = 10:Compute lg 10 = 1So, the original equation becomes:left(frac{3}{4}right)^1 + left(frac{4}{3}right)^1 = frac{3}{4} + frac{4}{3} = frac{9}{12} + frac{16}{12} = frac{25}{12}Which matches the right-hand side. Good.Now, test x = frac{1}{10}:Compute lg left(frac{1}{10}right) = -1So, the original equation becomes:left(frac{3}{4}right)^{-1} + left(frac{4}{3}right)^{-1} = frac{4}{3} + frac{3}{4} = frac{16}{12} + frac{9}{12} = frac{25}{12}Which also matches. Perfect.So, both solutions are valid.Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 10 and x = frac{1}{10}.**Final Answer**The solutions are boxed{10} and boxed{dfrac{1}{10}}."},{"question":"Given that tan (3 alpha-2 beta)=frac{1}{2} and tan (5 alpha-4 beta)=frac{1}{4}, find tan alpha.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given two tangent functions involving angles that are combinations of α and β. Specifically, I know that tan(3α - 2β) is 1/2 and tan(5α - 4β) is 1/4. I need to find tan α. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving tangent functions, sometimes it's helpful to use the tangent addition or subtraction formulas. But in this case, the angles are linear combinations of α and β, so maybe I can set up a system of equations. Let me denote:Let’s let x = 3α - 2β and y = 5α - 4β. Then, I know that tan x = 1/2 and tan y = 1/4. So, I have two equations:1. x = 3α - 2β2. y = 5α - 4βAnd I know tan x and tan y. My goal is to find tan α. Hmm, so maybe I can solve for α and β in terms of x and y, and then use the tangent addition formula or something like that.Wait, but I don't know x and y, only their tangents. Maybe I can express α and β in terms of x and y. Let me try to solve the system of equations for α and β.So, I have:Equation 1: x = 3α - 2βEquation 2: y = 5α - 4βI can write this as a system:3α - 2β = x5α - 4β = yLet me solve this system for α and β. Maybe I can use the method of elimination. Let's multiply Equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of β the same:Equation 1 multiplied by 2: 6α - 4β = 2xEquation 2: 5α - 4β = yNow, subtract Equation 2 from the multiplied Equation 1:(6α - 4β) - (5α - 4β) = 2x - ySimplify:6α - 4β - 5α + 4β = 2x - yWhich simplifies to:α = 2x - yOkay, so α is equal to 2x - y. That's interesting. Now, let me solve for β. Let's plug α back into one of the original equations. Let's take Equation 1:x = 3α - 2βWe know α = 2x - y, so substitute:x = 3(2x - y) - 2βExpand:x = 6x - 3y - 2βBring all terms to one side:x - 6x + 3y = -2βSimplify:-5x + 3y = -2βMultiply both sides by (-1):5x - 3y = 2βSo, β = (5x - 3y)/2Okay, so now I have expressions for α and β in terms of x and y:α = 2x - yβ = (5x - 3y)/2But I don't know x and y, but I do know tan x and tan y. Maybe I can express tan α in terms of tan x and tan y, using the tangent addition formula.Wait, because α = 2x - y, so tan α = tan(2x - y). I can use the tangent subtraction formula:tan(A - B) = (tan A - tan B)/(1 + tan A tan B)But here, it's 2x - y, so maybe I need to first find tan(2x) and then use the subtraction formula.Alternatively, I can use the formula for tan(2x - y) directly. Let me recall the formula:tan(A - B) = (tan A - tan B)/(1 + tan A tan B)But in this case, A is 2x, so I need tan(2x). I can use the double angle formula for tangent:tan(2x) = 2 tan x / (1 - tan² x)Given that tan x = 1/2, so tan(2x) = 2*(1/2)/(1 - (1/2)²) = (1)/(1 - 1/4) = 1/(3/4) = 4/3.Okay, so tan(2x) is 4/3. Now, I can use the subtraction formula for tan(2x - y):tan(2x - y) = (tan 2x - tan y)/(1 + tan 2x tan y)We know tan 2x is 4/3 and tan y is 1/4, so plug those in:tan(α) = (4/3 - 1/4)/(1 + (4/3)(1/4))Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.Numerator: 4/3 - 1/4. To subtract these, find a common denominator, which is 12.4/3 = 16/12, 1/4 = 3/12, so 16/12 - 3/12 = 13/12.Denominator: 1 + (4/3)(1/4) = 1 + (4/12) = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3.So, tan α = (13/12) / (4/3) = (13/12) * (3/4) = (13*3)/(12*4) = 39/48.Simplify 39/48 by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 13/16.So, tan α is 13/16.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I set x = 3α - 2β and y = 5α - 4β. Then, I solved for α and β in terms of x and y, getting α = 2x - y and β = (5x - 3y)/2. Then, I expressed tan α as tan(2x - y). I found tan(2x) using the double angle formula: tan(2x) = 4/3. Then, I used the subtraction formula for tan(2x - y):tan(2x - y) = (tan 2x - tan y)/(1 + tan 2x tan y) = (4/3 - 1/4)/(1 + (4/3)(1/4)).Calculating numerator: 4/3 - 1/4 = 16/12 - 3/12 = 13/12.Denominator: 1 + (4/3)(1/4) = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3.So, tan α = (13/12)/(4/3) = (13/12)*(3/4) = 39/48 = 13/16.Yes, that seems correct. So, tan α is 13/16.But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe by expressing β in terms of α from the first equation and substituting into the second.From the first equation: tan(3α - 2β) = 1/2.Let me denote θ = 3α - 2β, so tan θ = 1/2.Similarly, from the second equation: tan(5α - 4β) = 1/4.Let me denote φ = 5α - 4β, so tan φ = 1/4.Now, notice that φ = 5α - 4β can be written as φ = 2*(3α - 2β) - (α). Because 2*(3α - 2β) = 6α - 4β, so subtracting α gives 5α - 4β, which is φ.So, φ = 2θ - α.Therefore, tan φ = tan(2θ - α).We can use the tangent subtraction formula again:tan(2θ - α) = (tan 2θ - tan α)/(1 + tan 2θ tan α)But we know tan φ = 1/4, so:1/4 = (tan 2θ - tan α)/(1 + tan 2θ tan α)We also know tan θ = 1/2, so tan 2θ can be calculated:tan 2θ = 2 tan θ / (1 - tan² θ) = 2*(1/2)/(1 - (1/2)^2) = 1/(1 - 1/4) = 1/(3/4) = 4/3.So, tan 2θ = 4/3.Substituting back into the equation:1/4 = (4/3 - tan α)/(1 + (4/3) tan α)Let me denote tan α as t for simplicity.So, 1/4 = (4/3 - t)/(1 + (4/3)t)Cross-multiplying:1*(1 + (4/3)t) = 4*(4/3 - t)Multiply out both sides:1 + (4/3)t = 16/3 - 4tMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:3 + 4t = 16 - 12tBring all terms to one side:4t + 12t = 16 - 316t = 13t = 13/16So, tan α = 13/16.Okay, so that confirms the earlier result. So, I can be confident that tan α is 13/16.Just to recap, I approached the problem by setting up a system of equations with x and y, solved for α and β in terms of x and y, then used the tangent addition and subtraction formulas to express tan α in terms of tan x and tan y, which were given. Then, I cross-verified by expressing φ in terms of θ and α, leading to the same result. Both methods gave me tan α = 13/16, so I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of tan alpha is boxed{dfrac{13}{16}}."},{"question":"Can the least common multiple of the integers 1,2, ldots, n be 2008 times greater than the least common multiple of the integers 1,2, ldots, m?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Can the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers from 1 to n be 2008 times greater than the LCM of the integers from 1 to m? In other words, is there a pair of integers m and n such that LCM(1, 2, ..., n) = 2008 * LCM(1, 2, ..., m)?Hmm, let me think about how LCMs work. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that all of them divide into. For the numbers from 1 to n, the LCM is often denoted as LCM(n). I remember that LCM(n) is the product of the highest powers of all primes less than or equal to n. So, for example, LCM(10) is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7, because 8 is the highest power of 2 less than 10, 9 is the highest power of 3, and 5 and 7 are primes.So, if I want LCM(n) to be 2008 times LCM(m), I need to factor 2008 into its prime components and see if that can be achieved by the ratio of two such LCMs. Let me factor 2008.2008 divided by 2 is 1004, divided by 2 again is 502, and again by 2 is 251. 251 is a prime number, right? Let me check: 251 divided by 2 is not whole, 3? 251/3 is about 83.666, not whole. 5? Doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7? 251/7 is about 35.857, not whole. 11? 251/11 is about 22.818, nope. 13? 251/13 is about 19.307, nope. 17? 251/17 is about 14.764, nope. 19? 251/19 is about 13.21, nope. So yeah, 251 is prime. So 2008 factors into 2^3 * 251^1.So, the ratio LCM(n)/LCM(m) needs to be 2^3 * 251. That means that the primes in LCM(n) compared to LCM(m) must introduce factors of 2^3 and 251, but without introducing any other prime factors that aren't already in LCM(m). Wait, but 251 is a prime number, so if LCM(n) includes 251, then n must be at least 251, right? Because LCM(n) includes all primes up to n.Similarly, LCM(m) would not include 251 unless m is at least 251. But if m is less than 251, then LCM(m) doesn't have 251 as a factor, and LCM(n) does, so the ratio would include 251 as a factor. So, if n is at least 251 and m is less than 251, then LCM(n)/LCM(m) would be a multiple of 251, which is part of the ratio we need.But we also need the ratio to be exactly 2008, which is 2^3 * 251. So, the other part is the factor of 2^3. So, the exponent of 2 in LCM(n) must be exactly 3 more than the exponent of 2 in LCM(m). Let me recall that the exponent of a prime p in LCM(n) is the largest integer k such that p^k ≤ n.So, for prime 2, the exponent in LCM(n) is floor(log2(n)). Similarly, for LCM(m), it's floor(log2(m)). So, the difference between these two exponents should be 3. That is, floor(log2(n)) - floor(log2(m)) = 3.Let me denote k = floor(log2(m)). Then floor(log2(n)) = k + 3.So, n must be at least 2^{k+3}, and m must be less than 2^{k+1}. But we also know that n must be at least 251 because LCM(n) includes 251. So, 2^{k+3} ≤ n < 2^{k+4}, and m < 2^{k+1}.But n must be at least 251, so 2^{k+3} ≤ 251. Let's compute 2^7 = 128, 2^8=256. So, 2^{k+3} ≤251 implies that k+3 ≤7, because 2^8=256>251. So, k+3 ≤7 => k ≤4.So, k can be at most 4. Therefore, k can be 0,1,2,3,4.But let's see, if k=4, then floor(log2(m))=4, so m is between 16 and 31 (since 2^4=16 and 2^5=32). Then floor(log2(n))=7, so n is between 128 and 255. But n must be at least 251, so n is between 251 and 255.Wait, 251 is prime, so LCM(n) would include 251. So, if n is 251, 252, 253, 254, or 255, then LCM(n) includes 251. So, let's check for n=251.Compute LCM(n)/LCM(m). LCM(n) is LCM(251), which is LCM(250) multiplied by 251, since 251 is prime. Similarly, LCM(m) is LCM(31), since m is less than 32.Wait, but m is less than 2^{k+1}=2^5=32, so m is up to 31. So, LCM(m)=LCM(31). So, LCM(n)/LCM(m)=251 * (LCM(250)/LCM(31)).But LCM(250) is LCM(31) multiplied by primes between 32 and 250, each raised to their highest powers. So, LCM(250)/LCM(31) is equal to the product of primes between 32 and 250, each raised to their highest powers in 250.But 2008 is 2^3 *251. So, LCM(n)/LCM(m)=251 * (something). That something must be 2^3, because 251*(something)=2008=2^3*251. So, that something must be 8.Therefore, LCM(250)/LCM(31)=8.Wait, is that possible? Let's compute LCM(250) and LCM(31).LCM(31) is the product of primes up to 31, each raised to their highest powers. Similarly, LCM(250) is the product of primes up to 250, each raised to their highest powers.So, LCM(250)/LCM(31) is equal to the product of primes between 32 and 250, each raised to their highest powers in 250.But 8 is 2^3. So, the product of primes between 32 and 250, each raised to their highest powers, must equal 8. But 8 is 2^3, which is a prime power. However, primes between 32 and 250 include 37, 41, 43, etc., which are all primes greater than 2. So, their product would include primes other than 2, which would make the ratio have prime factors other than 2 and 251, which contradicts the ratio being 2008=2^3*251.Therefore, this approach doesn't work. So, maybe k=4 is not the right choice.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that n is 251. Maybe n is larger than 251, but then the ratio would include more primes, which would make the ratio larger than 2008. So, perhaps n can't be larger than 251 because that would introduce more prime factors.Alternatively, maybe n is exactly 251, but then LCM(251)/LCM(m)=2008. But as we saw, LCM(251)/LCM(31)=251*(something), and that something is more than 8 because LCM(250)/LCM(31) is much larger than 8.Wait, let me compute LCM(250)/LCM(31). Let's see, LCM(31) is 2^4 *3^3 *5^3 *7^2 *11*13*17*19*23*29*31. LCM(250) is LCM(31) multiplied by primes between 32 and 250, each to their highest powers. For example, 37^1, 41^1, 43^1, ..., up to 251, but 251 is prime, so LCM(250) doesn't include 251. Wait, no, LCM(250) is up to 250, so 251 is not included. So, LCM(250) is LCM(31) multiplied by primes between 32 and 250, each raised to their highest powers.But 32 is 2^5, so in LCM(250), the exponent of 2 is floor(log2(250))=7, since 2^7=128, 2^8=256>250. In LCM(31), the exponent of 2 is floor(log2(31))=4, since 2^4=16, 2^5=32>31. So, the exponent of 2 in LCM(250)/LCM(31) is 7-4=3, so 2^3.Similarly, for other primes, let's see. For example, 3: in LCM(250), the exponent is floor(log3(250))=5, since 3^5=243, 3^6=729>250. In LCM(31), the exponent is floor(log3(31))=3, since 3^3=27, 3^4=81>31. So, the exponent of 3 in the ratio is 5-3=2, so 3^2.Similarly, for 5: in LCM(250), exponent is floor(log5(250))=3, since 5^3=125, 5^4=625>250. In LCM(31), exponent is floor(log5(31))=2, since 5^2=25, 5^3=125>31. So, exponent of 5 in ratio is 3-2=1, so 5^1.For 7: in LCM(250), exponent is floor(log7(250))=3, since 7^3=343>250, so 2. Wait, 7^2=49, 7^3=343>250, so exponent is 2. In LCM(31), exponent is floor(log7(31))=1, since 7^1=7, 7^2=49>31. So, exponent of 7 in ratio is 2-1=1, so 7^1.Similarly, for primes like 11: in LCM(250), exponent is floor(log11(250))=2, since 11^2=121, 11^3=1331>250. In LCM(31), exponent is floor(log11(31))=1, since 11^1=11, 11^2=121>31. So, exponent of 11 in ratio is 2-1=1, so 11^1.This pattern continues for all primes between 32 and 250. Each prime p in that range will have exponent 1 in LCM(250)/LCM(31), because in LCM(250), p appears once (since p <=250 and p is prime), and in LCM(31), p doesn't appear at all (since p>31). So, the ratio LCM(250)/LCM(31) is equal to 2^3 *3^2 *5^1 *7^1 *11^1 *... * primes between 32 and 250.But 2^3 *3^2 *5 *7 *11 *... is way larger than 8. In fact, it's much larger than 2008. Therefore, LCM(251)/LCM(31)=251*(something much larger than 8). So, the ratio would be way larger than 2008, which is not what we want.Therefore, maybe k=4 is too big. Let's try k=3. So, floor(log2(m))=3, meaning m is between 8 and 15. Then floor(log2(n))=6, so n is between 64 and 127.But n must be at least 251, which is not the case here. So, n=64 to 127 is less than 251, so LCM(n) doesn't include 251. Therefore, the ratio LCM(n)/LCM(m) would not include 251, which is needed for 2008. So, this doesn't work.Wait, but 2008 includes 251, so n must be at least 251. So, k must be such that 2^{k+3} <=251. As before, 2^8=256>251, so k+3<=7, so k<=4. But when k=4, n is between 128 and 255, but n must be at least 251, so n is between 251 and 255.But as we saw earlier, LCM(n)/LCM(m) would include 251 and other primes, making the ratio too big. So, maybe there's no solution?Wait, but let's think differently. Maybe m is equal to n-1 or something. Let me see.Suppose n = m +1. Then LCM(n) is either equal to LCM(m) or LCM(m)*n, depending on whether n is a prime or not. If n is prime, then LCM(n)=LCM(m)*n. If n is composite, then LCM(n)=LCM(m). So, if n is prime, the ratio is n. If n is composite, the ratio is 1.So, if we have LCM(n)/LCM(m)=2008, then n must be prime, and 2008 must be equal to n. But 2008 is not prime, as we saw earlier, it's 2^3*251. So, that approach doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe n is such that LCM(n) is 2008 times LCM(m), but n is not just m+1. Maybe n is significantly larger than m, but not so large that LCM(n) includes too many extra primes.Wait, but 2008=2^3*251. So, the ratio LCM(n)/LCM(m) must be exactly 2^3*251. That means that LCM(n) must include exactly the primes in LCM(m) plus 251, and the exponents of primes in LCM(n) must be exactly 3 more for 2, and the same for others, except for 251, which is added.But 251 is a prime, so LCM(n) must include 251, meaning n >=251. But then, LCM(n) would include all primes up to n, which includes primes larger than 251 if n>251. So, unless n=251, LCM(n) will include primes beyond 251, which would make the ratio have more prime factors, which is not allowed because 2008 only has 2 and 251.Therefore, n must be exactly 251, because if n>251, LCM(n) would include primes larger than 251, making the ratio have more prime factors. So, n=251.Then, LCM(251)/LCM(m)=2008=2^3*251. So, LCM(251)=2008*LCM(m). Therefore, LCM(m)=LCM(251)/2008= (2^3*3^3*5^3*7^2*11*13*17*19*23*29*31*...*251)/ (2^3*251).Wait, let me compute LCM(251). LCM(251) is the product of primes up to 251, each raised to their highest powers less than or equal to 251. So, for prime 2, the highest power is 128=2^7. For 3, it's 81=3^4. For 5, it's 125=5^3. For 7, it's 49=7^2. For primes 11,13,17,19,23,29,31, etc., up to 251, each is raised to the first power.So, LCM(251)=2^7 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *17 *19 *23 *29 *31 *...*251.Similarly, LCM(m) would be the product of primes up to m, each raised to their highest powers. So, LCM(m)=2^a *3^b *5^c *7^d *... where a <=7, b<=4, c<=3, d<=2, etc.Given that LCM(251)/LCM(m)=2^3*251, we can write:(2^7 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*251) / (2^a *3^b *5^c *7^d *...)=2^3 *251.So, simplifying, we have:2^(7-a) *3^(4-b) *5^(3-c) *7^(2-d) *11^(1-e) *13^(1-f)*...*251^(1-g)=2^3 *251.Where e,f,...g are the exponents of primes 11,13,...,251 in LCM(m). Since LCM(m) is up to m, which is less than 251, the exponents for primes above m would be zero.So, for primes greater than m, their exponents in LCM(m) are zero, so in the ratio, they would be 11^(1-0)=11, 13^(1-0)=13, etc., up to 251^(1-0)=251. But in the ratio, we only have 2^3 *251. Therefore, all primes between 11 and 251 must have exponent zero in the ratio, meaning that their exponents in LCM(m) must be 1. Wait, no, because in the ratio, we have 11^(1-e)=1, which implies that e=1. Similarly, for all primes p between 11 and 251, their exponents in LCM(m) must be 1, meaning that p is included in LCM(m), so m must be at least p. But p can be up to 251, which would mean m >=251, but m must be less than 251 because LCM(m) doesn't include 251. Contradiction.Wait, let me clarify. For primes p between 11 and 251, in LCM(m), their exponents are either 0 or 1, depending on whether p <=m. In the ratio, we have p^(1 - e_p), where e_p is the exponent of p in LCM(m). For the ratio to not include any primes other than 2 and 251, we must have p^(1 - e_p)=1 for all p between 11 and 251. Therefore, 1 - e_p=0 => e_p=1. So, for all primes p between 11 and 251, e_p=1, meaning that p <=m. But m must be less than 251, so m must be at least the largest prime less than 251, which is 241, 251 is prime but m must be less than 251, so the largest prime less than 251 is 241. Therefore, m must be at least 241 to include all primes up to 241.But wait, m must be less than 251, so m can be up to 250. But if m is 250, then LCM(m) includes all primes up to 250, which includes 251? No, wait, 251 is prime and greater than 250, so LCM(250) doesn't include 251. So, m must be less than 251, so m can be up to 250, but LCM(m) doesn't include 251.But for the ratio LCM(251)/LCM(m)=2^3*251, we need that for all primes p between 11 and 251, p^(1 - e_p)=1, which implies e_p=1. So, for p=11,13,...,241, e_p=1, meaning that p <=m. Therefore, m must be at least 241, because 241 is the largest prime less than 251. So, m must be at least 241.But m must be less than 251, so m is between 241 and 250. Let's check m=241.Compute LCM(251)/LCM(241). LCM(251)=LCM(241)*251, because 251 is prime and greater than 241. So, LCM(251)/LCM(241)=251. But we need the ratio to be 2008=2^3*251. So, 251 is not enough; we need an additional factor of 8.So, maybe m is less than 241? Wait, but if m is less than 241, then LCM(m) doesn't include some primes between 11 and 241, which would mean that in the ratio LCM(251)/LCM(m), those primes would appear with exponent 1, making the ratio have more prime factors, which is not allowed because 2008 only has 2 and 251.Therefore, m must be at least 241 to include all primes up to 241, but then the ratio is 251, which is less than 2008. So, we need to get a ratio of 2008=8*251. So, maybe m is such that LCM(251)/LCM(m)=8*251.So, LCM(251)/LCM(m)=8*251. Therefore, LCM(m)=LCM(251)/(8*251)=LCM(251)/(2^3*251).But LCM(251)=2^7 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*251.So, LCM(m)= (2^7 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*251)/(2^3 *251)=2^(7-3) *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*241.So, LCM(m)=2^4 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*241.Therefore, m must be such that LCM(m)=2^4 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*241.So, let's see what m would be. The primes in LCM(m) go up to 241, so m must be at least 241. Also, the exponents of primes in LCM(m) must be as follows:- For 2: exponent 4, so m must be at least 16 (since 2^4=16).- For 3: exponent 4, so m must be at least 81 (since 3^4=81).- For 5: exponent 3, so m must be at least 125 (since 5^3=125).- For 7: exponent 2, so m must be at least 49 (since 7^2=49).- For primes 11,13,...,241: exponent 1, so m must be at least each of these primes, so m must be at least 241.Therefore, m must be at least 125, because 125 is larger than 81 and 49 and 16. But m must be at least 241 to include all primes up to 241. So, m=241.But wait, LCM(241)=2^7 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*241. Because 2^7=128<=241, 3^4=81<=241, 5^3=125<=241, 7^2=49<=241. So, LCM(241)=2^7 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*241.But we need LCM(m)=2^4 *3^4 *5^3 *7^2 *11 *13 *...*241. So, LCM(m) must have 2^4 instead of 2^7. So, m must be such that the exponent of 2 in LCM(m) is 4, which means m must be less than 16, because 2^4=16. Wait, but m must be at least 241 to include all primes up to 241. Contradiction.Because if m is at least 241, then the exponent of 2 in LCM(m) is floor(log2(241))=7, since 2^7=128<=241, 2^8=256>241. So, exponent of 2 is 7, but we need it to be 4. Therefore, this is impossible.Therefore, there is no integer m such that LCM(251)/LCM(m)=2008=2^3*251. Because m would have to be at least 241 to include all primes up to 241, but that forces the exponent of 2 in LCM(m) to be 7, which is too high, making the ratio only 251, not 2008.Alternatively, maybe m is less than 241, but then LCM(m) would miss some primes, leading to the ratio having extra prime factors, which is not allowed.Therefore, it's impossible for LCM(n)/LCM(m)=2008. So, the answer is no, it's not possible."},{"question":"Given that the operation \\"※\\" is defined as follows: for any two numbers (a) and (b), (a ※ b = frac{a + 2b}{3}).

Let me try to visualize it first. There's a line segment AC, and point B is somewhere on it. Then, M is the midpoint of AB, N is the midpoint of AC, P is the midpoint of NA, and Q is the midpoint of MA. I need to find the ratio of MN to PQ, which is MN : PQ. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. Hmm, okay.Let me draw a diagram in my mind. Let's say AC is a horizontal line. Point A is on the left, C is on the right, and B is somewhere between them. Since M is the midpoint of AB, it should be halfway between A and B. Similarly, N is the midpoint of AC, so it's halfway between A and C. Then, P is the midpoint of NA, so that would be halfway between N and A. And Q is the midpoint of MA, which is halfway between M and A.Wait, maybe assigning coordinates will help. Let me assign coordinates to each point to make it easier. Let's place point A at 0 on a number line. Then, since AC is a line segment, let me assign point C at some coordinate, say, 4 units away for simplicity. So, A is at 0, C is at 4. Then, point B is somewhere between A and C, but since the problem doesn't specify where, maybe the ratio will hold regardless of where B is.Wait, actually, if B is on AC, then AB is a part of AC. So, let me assign coordinates accordingly. Let me let AC be from 0 to 4, so A is at 0, C is at 4. Let me pick B at some point, say, 2 for simplicity. Wait, but if I pick B at 2, then M, the midpoint of AB, would be at 1. N, the midpoint of AC, would be at 2. Then, P is the midpoint of NA. NA is from N (2) to A (0), so midpoint P would be at 1. Similarly, Q is the midpoint of MA. MA is from M (1) to A (0), so midpoint Q would be at 0.5.Wait, then MN is the distance from M (1) to N (2), which is 1 unit. PQ is the distance from P (1) to Q (0.5), which is 0.5 units. So, the ratio MN : PQ is 1 : 0.5, which simplifies to 2:1. So, the ratio is 2, which is option B.Wait, but hold on, I assumed B was at 2. What if B is somewhere else? Let me test another position for B. Let's say B is at 1. Then, M, the midpoint of AB, would be at 0.5. N is still the midpoint of AC, so at 2. Then, P is the midpoint of NA, which is from N (2) to A (0), so midpoint P is at 1. Q is the midpoint of MA, which is from M (0.5) to A (0), so midpoint Q is at 0.25.Then, MN is the distance from M (0.5) to N (2), which is 1.5 units. PQ is the distance from P (1) to Q (0.25), which is 0.75 units. So, the ratio MN : PQ is 1.5 : 0.75, which simplifies to 2:1 again. So, same ratio.Hmm, interesting. Let me try another position for B. Let me put B at 3. Then, M is the midpoint of AB, so from 0 to 3, midpoint is at 1.5. N is still at 2. P is the midpoint of NA, which is from 2 to 0, so midpoint is at 1. Q is the midpoint of MA, which is from 1.5 to 0, so midpoint is at 0.75.Then, MN is from 1.5 to 2, which is 0.5 units. PQ is from 1 to 0.75, which is 0.25 units. So, the ratio is 0.5 : 0.25, which is 2:1 again.Wait, so regardless of where B is on AC, the ratio MN : PQ is always 2:1? That seems consistent. So, the answer should be 2, which is option B.But let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe using coordinate geometry is a solid approach here.Let me denote the length of AC as 4 units for simplicity, as I did before. So, A is at 0, C is at 4. Let me let B be at some point x, where x is between 0 and 4. Then, M is the midpoint of AB, so M is at (0 + x)/2 = x/2. N is the midpoint of AC, so N is at (0 + 4)/2 = 2. P is the midpoint of NA, which is from N (2) to A (0), so midpoint P is at (2 + 0)/2 = 1. Q is the midpoint of MA, which is from M (x/2) to A (0), so midpoint Q is at (x/2 + 0)/2 = x/4.So, MN is the distance between M (x/2) and N (2). So, MN = |2 - x/2|. PQ is the distance between P (1) and Q (x/4). So, PQ = |1 - x/4|.But since x is between 0 and 4, let's see:If x is between 0 and 4, then x/2 is between 0 and 2, so 2 - x/2 is positive. Similarly, x/4 is between 0 and 1, so 1 - x/4 is positive. Therefore, MN = 2 - x/2, and PQ = 1 - x/4.So, the ratio MN : PQ is (2 - x/2) : (1 - x/4). Let me compute this ratio.Let me write it as (2 - x/2) / (1 - x/4). Let me factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: 2 - x/2 = (4 - x)/2Denominator: 1 - x/4 = (4 - x)/4So, the ratio becomes [(4 - x)/2] / [(4 - x)/4] = [(4 - x)/2] * [4/(4 - x)] = (4 - x) cancels out, so 4/2 = 2.So, the ratio is 2, regardless of x. So, MN : PQ is 2:1, so the answer is 2, which is option B.Therefore, I think the correct answer is B) 2.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"For each natural number from 1 to 999, Damir subtracted the last digit from the first digit and wrote all the resulting 1000 differences on the board. For example, for the number 7, Damir wrote 0; for the number 105, he wrote (-4); for the number 61, he wrote 5.What is the sum of all the numbers on the board?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Damir subtracts the last digit from the first digit of each natural number from 1 to 999 and writes down the result. I need to find the sum of all these differences. Hmm, let me try to break this down.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. For each number from 1 to 999, Damir takes the first digit (which is the hundreds digit if it's a three-digit number, the tens digit if it's a two-digit number, or just the units digit if it's a single-digit number) and subtracts the last digit (which is the units digit). Then he writes down this difference. I need to sum all these differences.Let me take some examples to see if I got it right. For the number 7, which is a single-digit number, the first digit is 7, and the last digit is also 7. So, 7 - 7 = 0. That makes sense. For 105, which is a three-digit number, the first digit is 1, and the last digit is 5. So, 1 - 5 = -4. For 61, which is a two-digit number, the first digit is 6, and the last digit is 1. So, 6 - 1 = 5. Okay, that all checks out.Now, I need to compute the sum of all these differences for numbers from 1 to 999. Let me think about how to approach this systematically.First, let's consider the numbers from 1 to 999. These can be categorized into three groups: single-digit numbers (1-9), two-digit numbers (10-99), and three-digit numbers (100-999). Maybe I can handle each category separately and then add up their contributions.Starting with single-digit numbers: Each number from 1 to 9 is a single-digit number. For each of these, the first digit is the same as the last digit, so the difference is 0. Therefore, the sum of differences for single-digit numbers is 0. That's straightforward.Moving on to two-digit numbers: These are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number can be represented as \\"AB,\\" where A is the tens digit (from 1 to 9) and B is the units digit (from 0 to 9). The difference Damir calculates is A - B. So, for each two-digit number, the difference is (tens digit) - (units digit).To find the total sum for all two-digit numbers, I can think of it as summing (A - B) for all A from 1 to 9 and all B from 0 to 9. So, the total sum would be the sum over A from 1 to 9 of [sum over B from 0 to 9 of (A - B)].Let me compute this step by step. For each A, the inner sum is sum_{B=0}^{9} (A - B). Let's compute this inner sum first.sum_{B=0}^{9} (A - B) = sum_{B=0}^{9} A - sum_{B=0}^{9} B = 10*A - (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 9)We know that the sum from 0 to 9 is (9*10)/2 = 45. So, the inner sum becomes 10A - 45.Therefore, for each A, the contribution is 10A - 45. Now, we need to sum this over A from 1 to 9.So, the total sum for two-digit numbers is sum_{A=1}^{9} (10A - 45) = 10*sum_{A=1}^{9} A - 45*9.Compute each part:sum_{A=1}^{9} A = (9*10)/2 = 45.So, 10*45 = 450.45*9 = 405.Therefore, the total sum is 450 - 405 = 45.So, the sum of differences for all two-digit numbers is 45.Now, moving on to three-digit numbers: These are from 100 to 999. Each three-digit number can be represented as \\"ABC,\\" where A is the hundreds digit (from 1 to 9), B is the tens digit (from 0 to 9), and C is the units digit (from 0 to 9). The difference Damir calculates is A - C.So, for each three-digit number, the difference is (hundreds digit) - (units digit). To find the total sum, we need to compute sum_{A=1}^{9} sum_{B=0}^{9} sum_{C=0}^{9} (A - C).Wait, actually, since B doesn't affect the difference, we can ignore it and just consider A and C. So, the total sum is sum_{A=1}^{9} sum_{C=0}^{9} (A - C) multiplied by the number of possible B's, which is 10 (from 0 to 9). So, actually, the total sum is 10 * sum_{A=1}^{9} sum_{C=0}^{9} (A - C).Let me compute this.First, compute the inner sum for each A: sum_{C=0}^{9} (A - C) = sum_{C=0}^{9} A - sum_{C=0}^{9} C = 10A - 45, similar to the two-digit case.So, for each A, the inner sum is 10A - 45. Then, sum this over A from 1 to 9:sum_{A=1}^{9} (10A - 45) = 10*sum_{A=1}^{9} A - 45*9.Again, sum_{A=1}^{9} A = 45, so 10*45 = 450.45*9 = 405.So, sum_{A=1}^{9} (10A - 45) = 450 - 405 = 45.Then, multiply by 10 (for the tens digit B) to get the total sum for three-digit numbers: 45 * 10 = 450.Therefore, the sum of differences for all three-digit numbers is 450.Now, let's recap:- Single-digit numbers: sum = 0- Two-digit numbers: sum = 45- Three-digit numbers: sum = 450Adding these together: 0 + 45 + 450 = 495.Wait, hold on. Is that the final answer? Let me double-check my calculations because 45 + 450 is 495, but I feel like maybe I missed something.Wait, no, actually, let me think again. For the three-digit numbers, each A and C combination is multiplied by 10 because B can be anything from 0 to 9. So, each (A - C) occurs 10 times. So, when I computed sum_{A=1}^{9} sum_{C=0}^{9} (A - C) = 45, then multiplied by 10, I get 450. That seems correct.Similarly, for two-digit numbers, each (A - B) occurs once for each A and B, so sum is 45.Single-digit numbers: 0.So, total sum is 0 + 45 + 450 = 495.But wait, let me think again about the three-digit numbers. Each three-digit number is from 100 to 999, which is 900 numbers. Each number is represented as ABC, and the difference is A - C. So, for each A from 1 to 9, and each C from 0 to 9, how many times does each (A - C) occur? For each A and C, B can be 0-9, so 10 times. So, the total number of terms is 9*10*10=900, which is correct.So, the sum is 10*(sum_{A=1}^{9} sum_{C=0}^{9} (A - C)) = 10*(sum_{A=1}^{9} [10A - 45]) = 10*(450 - 405)=10*45=450. So, that seems correct.Similarly, for two-digit numbers, it's 90 numbers (from 10 to 99). Each A from 1-9, each B from 0-9. So, 9*10=90 numbers. The sum is 45, which is correct.Single-digit numbers: 9 numbers, sum 0.So, 0 + 45 + 450 = 495.Wait, but let me think about the single-digit numbers again. The problem says \\"for each natural number from 1 to 999.\\" So, 1 to 999 inclusive. So, 999 numbers. Wait, but 1 to 999 is 999 numbers, but when I broke it down, single-digit (9), two-digit (90), three-digit (900). 9 + 90 + 900 = 999. So, that's correct.But when I calculated the sum, I got 0 + 45 + 450 = 495. So, is that the final answer? Hmm.Wait, let me think about the single-digit numbers again. For each single-digit number, the first digit is the same as the last digit, so the difference is 0. So, 9 numbers, each contributing 0, so total 0. That's correct.But wait, let me think about the number 10. It's a two-digit number, A=1, B=0. So, difference is 1 - 0 = 1. Similarly, number 19: A=1, B=9, difference is 1 - 9 = -8.Wait, but when I calculated the two-digit numbers, I considered all A from 1-9 and B from 0-9, so 90 numbers, and the sum was 45. Let me verify that.For two-digit numbers, each A from 1-9, each B from 0-9. For each A, the sum over B is 10A - 45. So, for A=1: 10*1 - 45 = -35. For A=2: 20 - 45 = -25. Wait, hold on, that can't be. Wait, no, wait: 10A - 45.Wait, for A=1: 10*1 - 45 = -35A=2: 20 - 45 = -25A=3: 30 - 45 = -15A=4: 40 - 45 = -5A=5: 50 - 45 = 5A=6: 60 - 45 = 15A=7: 70 - 45 = 25A=8: 80 - 45 = 35A=9: 90 - 45 = 45So, adding these up:-35 -25 -15 -5 +5 +15 +25 +35 +45Let's compute step by step:Start with -35 -25 = -60-60 -15 = -75-75 -5 = -80-80 +5 = -75-75 +15 = -60-60 +25 = -35-35 +35 = 00 +45 = 45Yes, that adds up to 45. So, that's correct.So, the two-digit numbers contribute 45.Similarly, for three-digit numbers, each A from 1-9, each C from 0-9, and each B from 0-9. So, for each (A, C), there are 10 numbers (varying B). So, the sum is 10*(sum over A and C of (A - C)).Which we computed as 10*(45) = 450.So, 450 is correct.Therefore, the total sum is 0 + 45 + 450 = 495.Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to compute this?Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire range from 1 to 999 as three-digit numbers, padding single-digit and two-digit numbers with leading zeros. So, numbers from 001 to 999, but excluding 000. But in this case, Damir is subtracting the last digit from the first digit, so for numbers like 001, the first digit is 0, last digit is 1, so 0 - 1 = -1. But in the original problem, Damir only considers numbers from 1 to 999, so 001 is actually 1, which is a single-digit number, so he would have written 0 - 1 = -1? Wait, no, hold on.Wait, in the original problem, for single-digit numbers, Damir subtracts the last digit from the first digit. But for single-digit numbers, both first and last digits are the same, so the difference is 0. So, he doesn't write -1 for 1, he writes 0.Wait, so if I consider all numbers as three-digit numbers with leading zeros, then for numbers like 001, the first digit is 0, last digit is 1, so difference is -1. But in reality, Damir treats 1 as a single-digit number, so he subtracts 1 - 1 = 0. So, if I were to model this as three-digit numbers, I have to adjust for the fact that leading zeros are not actually considered in the original problem.Therefore, maybe my initial approach is better, treating single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers separately.But just to make sure, let me think about the total sum.Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire range from 1 to 999 as numbers from 000 to 999, excluding 000, but then adjust for the fact that leading zeros are not actually part of the number.But that might complicate things because Damir doesn't consider leading zeros. So, for numbers like 1, he only considers the single digit, not 001.Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is correct.But just to be thorough, let me consider the total sum as follows:For all numbers from 1 to 999, regardless of digit count, Damir subtracts the last digit from the first digit.So, for each number, regardless of being single, two, or three-digit, he subtracts last digit from first digit.So, for single-digit numbers, first digit = last digit, so difference is 0.For two-digit numbers, difference is tens digit - units digit.For three-digit numbers, difference is hundreds digit - units digit.So, in that case, the total sum is sum_{n=1}^{999} (first digit of n - last digit of n).Which is equal to sum_{n=1}^{999} first digit of n - sum_{n=1}^{999} last digit of n.So, maybe I can compute the total sum as (sum of first digits from 1 to 999) minus (sum of last digits from 1 to 999).That might be another approach.Let me try that.First, compute sum of first digits from 1 to 999.Then, compute sum of last digits from 1 to 999.Subtract the two.So, let's compute sum of first digits.First digits can be from 1 to 9.For numbers 1-9: first digit is 1-9, each appearing once.For numbers 10-99: first digit is 1-9, each appearing 10 times (for each units digit 0-9).For numbers 100-999: first digit is 1-9, each appearing 100 times (for each tens and units digit 0-9).So, total sum of first digits:Sum = (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) + (10*(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)) + (100*(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9))Compute each part:Sum from 1-9: 45Sum from 10-99: 10*45 = 450Sum from 100-999: 100*45 = 4500Total sum of first digits: 45 + 450 + 4500 = 4995.Now, compute sum of last digits from 1 to 999.Last digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers.From 1 to 999, there are 999 numbers.Number of complete cycles of 10: 999 / 10 = 99.9, so 99 complete cycles, and 9 extra numbers.Each complete cycle (10 numbers) has last digits 0-9, summing to 45.So, sum from complete cycles: 99*45 = 4455.Then, the remaining 9 numbers: 991 to 999. Their last digits are 1-9, so sum is 45.Wait, no. Wait, 999 is the last number, so the last 9 numbers would be 991-999, which have last digits 1-9. So, sum is 45.Therefore, total sum of last digits: 4455 + 45 = 4500.Wait, but hold on. From 1 to 999, the last digits cycle every 10 numbers, starting at 1 (last digit 1) up to 999 (last digit 9). So, the first number is 1 (last digit 1), the second is 2 (last digit 2), ..., the tenth is 10 (last digit 0). Then 11 (last digit 1), and so on.So, in each block of 10 numbers, the last digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the sum is 45.From 1 to 990, there are 99 blocks of 10, each summing to 45. So, 99*45 = 4455.Then, from 991 to 999, there are 9 numbers, with last digits 1-9, summing to 45.Wait, but 991-999 is 9 numbers, last digits 1-9, sum 45. So, total sum is 4455 + 45 = 4500.Therefore, sum of last digits is 4500.Therefore, total sum of differences is sum of first digits - sum of last digits = 4995 - 4500 = 495.So, that's the same result as before, 495. So, that seems to confirm the answer.Therefore, the sum of all the numbers on the board is 495.**Final Answer**The sum of all the numbers on the board is boxed{495}."},{"question":"log _{2}sin 15^{circ}-log_{frac{1}{2}}cos 345^{circ}=____.","answer":"Alright, so I have this logarithmic expression to solve: log _{2}sin 15^{circ}-log_{frac{1}{2}}cos 345^{circ}.

I recall that 15 degrees is 45 degrees minus 30 degrees. So, perhaps I can use the sine subtraction formula.The sine subtraction formula is sin(a - b) = sin a cos b - cos a sin b. Applying this to sin(45^{circ} - 30^{circ}), we get:sin 45^{circ} cos 30^{circ} - cos 45^{circ} sin 30^{circ}.I remember the exact values for these angles:sin 45^{circ} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2},cos 30^{circ} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2},cos 45^{circ} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2},sin 30^{circ} = frac{1}{2}.Plugging these into the formula:frac{sqrt{2}}{2} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} times frac{1}{2}.Calculating each term:First term: frac{sqrt{2} times sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{sqrt{6}}{4},Second term: frac{sqrt{2}}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4}.So, subtracting the second term from the first:frac{sqrt{6}}{4} - frac{sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4}.Therefore, sin 15^{circ} = frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4}. Okay, so now the first term becomes log_{2}left(frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4}right).Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify this logarithm. Let me write it as:log_{2}left(frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4}right) = log_{2}left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) - log_{2}4.Since log_{a}left(frac{b}{c}right) = log_{a}b - log_{a}c. That's a useful property.Now, log_{2}4 is straightforward because 2^2 = 4, so that's 2. So, the first term simplifies to log_{2}left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) - 2.Hmm, not sure if that helps much yet. Maybe I should hold onto that thought and move on to the second term.The second term is log_{frac{1}{2}}cos 345^{circ}. Let me see. First, I need to find cos 345^{circ}. 345 degrees is in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive. Also, 345 degrees is 360 - 15 degrees, so cos 345^{circ} = cos(360^{circ} - 15^{circ}) = cos 15^{circ}.So, cos 345^{circ} = cos 15^{circ}. I can use the same approach as before to find cos 15^{circ}. Using the cosine subtraction formula, since 15 degrees is 45 - 30 degrees.The formula is cos(a - b) = cos a cos b + sin a sin b. So, cos(45^{circ} - 30^{circ}) = cos 45^{circ} cos 30^{circ} + sin 45^{circ} sin 30^{circ}.Plugging in the known values:frac{sqrt{2}}{2} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} times frac{1}{2}.Calculating each term:First term: frac{sqrt{6}}{4},Second term: frac{sqrt{2}}{4}.Adding them together:frac{sqrt{6}}{4} + frac{sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}.So, cos 15^{circ} = frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}. Therefore, the second term becomes log_{frac{1}{2}}left(frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}right).Again, maybe I can split this logarithm into two parts:log_{frac{1}{2}}left(frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}right) = log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) - log_{frac{1}{2}}4.I know that log_{frac{1}{2}}4 is the exponent to which we raise 1/2 to get 4. Since (1/2)^{-2} = 4, because (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so the negative exponent flips it. So, log_{frac{1}{2}}4 = -2.Therefore, the second term simplifies to log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) - (-2) = log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) + 2.Wait, that might not be correct. Let me double-check. The property is log_{a}left(frac{b}{c}right) = log_{a}b - log_{a}c, so in this case, it's log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) - log_{frac{1}{2}}4, which is log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) - (-2), which is indeed log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) + 2.Okay, so now the original expression becomes:First term: log_{2}left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) - 2,Second term: log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) + 2.So, subtracting the second term from the first term:left[log_{2}left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) - 2right] - left[log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) + 2right].Let me distribute the subtraction:log_{2}left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) - 2 - log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) - 2.Combine like terms:log_{2}left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) - log_{frac{1}{2}}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) - 4.Hmm, okay. So, now I have two logarithms with different bases. Maybe I can express both with the same base to combine them. Let's recall that log_{frac{1}{2}}x can be rewritten in terms of base 2.I remember that log_{a}b = frac{log_{c}b}{log_{c}a} for any positive c ≠ 1. So, if I choose c = 2, then:log_{frac{1}{2}}x = frac{log_{2}x}{log_{2}frac{1}{2}}.But log_{2}frac{1}{2} = log_{2}2^{-1} = -1. So,log_{frac{1}{2}}x = frac{log_{2}x}{-1} = -log_{2}x.Ah, that's a useful identity. So, log_{frac{1}{2}}x = -log_{2}x.Therefore, the second logarithm term becomes:-log_{2}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right).So, substituting back into the expression:log_{2}left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) - left(-log_{2}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right)right) - 4.Simplify the double negative:log_{2}left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) + log_{2}left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) - 4.Now, I have two logarithms with the same base being added. I can use the property that log_{a}b + log_{a}c = log_{a}(b times c).So, combining the two logs:log_{2}left[ left(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}right) times left(sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}right) right] - 4.Multiplying those terms inside the log. I remember that (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2. So, let me apply that:left(sqrt{6}right)^2 - left(sqrt{2}right)^2 = 6 - 2 = 4.So, the expression simplifies to:log_{2}(4) - 4.I know that log_{2}(4) = 2, since 2^2 = 4. So, substituting that in:2 - 4 = -2.Wait, so the entire expression simplifies to -2? Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with log _{2}sin 15^{circ}-log_{frac{1}{2}}cos 345^{circ}.1. Expressed sin 15^{circ} and cos 345^{circ} in terms of known angles, using subtraction formulas.2. Calculated sin 15^{circ} = frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4} and cos 345^{circ} = frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}.3. Rewrote each logarithm, splitting them into two parts using logarithm properties.4. Converted the second logarithm's base from 1/2 to 2, using the identity log_{frac{1}{2}}x = -log_{2}x.5. Combined the two logarithms into a single log by multiplication, which simplified to log_{2}(4).6. Calculated log_{2}(4) = 2, then subtracted 4, resulting in -2.Seems solid. Let me just verify each step quickly.- The sine and cosine of 15 degrees were correctly calculated using the subtraction formulas.- The logarithms were split correctly using the division rule.- The base conversion for the second logarithm was correctly applied, turning it into a negative log base 2.- The multiplication inside the log was correctly simplified using the difference of squares.- The final calculation of log_{2}(4) - 4 was correct.I think that all checks out. So, the answer should be -2.**Final Answer**boxed{-2}"},{"question":"If the solution of the system of equations (left{begin{array}{r}x+y=P  3x+5y=13end{array}right.) are positive integers, find the value of (P).","answer":"Alright, so I have this system of equations to solve:[begin{cases}x + y = P 3x + 5y = 13end{cases}]And I need to find the value of ( P ) such that both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, since I have two equations and two variables, I can probably solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try substitution because the first equation is already solved for ( P ), which is ( x + y ). Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the second equation.From the first equation, ( x + y = P ), I can express ( x ) as ( x = P - y ). Alternatively, I could express ( y ) as ( y = P - x ). Either way, substitution seems straightforward.Let me substitute ( x = P - y ) into the second equation. So, replacing ( x ) in ( 3x + 5y = 13 ):[3(P - y) + 5y = 13]Let me expand this:[3P - 3y + 5y = 13]Combine like terms:[3P + 2y = 13]Hmm, so now I have an equation with ( P ) and ( y ). I need to find integer solutions where both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers. Since ( x = P - y ), ( P ) must be greater than ( y ) because ( x ) is positive.So, let me rearrange the equation ( 3P + 2y = 13 ) to express ( y ) in terms of ( P ):[2y = 13 - 3P][y = frac{13 - 3P}{2}]Since ( y ) must be a positive integer, ( frac{13 - 3P}{2} ) must be a positive integer. Therefore, ( 13 - 3P ) must be even and positive.Let me note two things:1. ( 13 - 3P ) must be positive:   [   13 - 3P > 0   ]   [   3P < 13   ]   [   P < frac{13}{3}   ]   Since ( P ) is an integer (because ( x ) and ( y ) are integers and ( x + y = P )), ( P ) must be less than approximately 4.333. So, possible integer values for ( P ) are 1, 2, 3, or 4.2. ( 13 - 3P ) must be even. Let me check each possible ( P ) value to see if this condition holds.Let's test each possible ( P ):- **Case 1: ( P = 1 )**  [  y = frac{13 - 3(1)}{2} = frac{10}{2} = 5  ]  Then, ( x = P - y = 1 - 5 = -4 ). But ( x ) is negative, which is not allowed because we need positive integers. So, ( P = 1 ) is invalid.- **Case 2: ( P = 2 )**  [  y = frac{13 - 3(2)}{2} = frac{7}{2} = 3.5  ]  ( y ) is not an integer, so ( P = 2 ) is invalid.- **Case 3: ( P = 3 )**  [  y = frac{13 - 3(3)}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2  ]  Then, ( x = 3 - 2 = 1 ). Both ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 2 ) are positive integers. So, ( P = 3 ) is a valid solution.- **Case 4: ( P = 4 )**  [  y = frac{13 - 3(4)}{2} = frac{1}{2} = 0.5  ]  ( y ) is not an integer, so ( P = 4 ) is invalid.So, from the possible values of ( P ), only ( P = 3 ) gives positive integer solutions for both ( x ) and ( y ).Wait, just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check.If ( P = 3 ), then:- ( x + y = 3 )- ( 3x + 5y = 13 )Substituting ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 2 ):First equation: ( 1 + 2 = 3 ) ✔️Second equation: ( 3(1) + 5(2) = 3 + 10 = 13 ) ✔️Perfect, both equations are satisfied.Is there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by solving for ( x ) instead of ( y )?Let me try that. From the first equation, ( x = P - y ). Substitute into the second equation:[3(P - y) + 5y = 13]Which simplifies to:[3P - 3y + 5y = 13][3P + 2y = 13]Same as before. So, either way, substitution leads to the same equation.Alternatively, maybe using elimination. Let's try that.Multiply the first equation by 3:[3x + 3y = 3P]Subtract this from the second equation:[(3x + 5y) - (3x + 3y) = 13 - 3P][2y = 13 - 3P]Which is the same as before. So, same result.Therefore, regardless of the method, I end up with ( y = frac{13 - 3P}{2} ), which must be a positive integer.So, the only valid ( P ) is 3.Wait, just to be thorough, could ( P ) be a non-integer? But since ( x ) and ( y ) are integers, their sum ( P ) must also be an integer. So, ( P ) must be an integer.Hence, the only possible value is 3.I think that's solid. I don't see any other possibilities or mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The value of ( P ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"For the one-variable quadratic equation x^{2}+bx-10=0 with one root being 2, the value of b is ____.","answer":"To determine the value of ( b ) in the quadratic equation ( x^2 + bx - 10 = 0 ) with one root being 2, I can use the fact that if a number is a root of the equation, it satisfies the equation when substituted for ( x ).Substituting ( x = 2 ) into the equation gives:[2^2 + b cdot 2 - 10 = 0]Simplifying this, I get:[4 + 2b - 10 = 0]Combining like terms:[2b - 6 = 0]Solving for ( b ):[2b = 6 b = 3]"},{"question":"A high school has a total of 2400 students across grades 10, 11, and 12.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, the numbers we're considering are from 500 up to, but not including, 1000. So that's all the three-digit numbers starting with 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Each of these numbers has three digits: the hundreds place, the tens place, and the units place.Since we're looking for numbers that contain both the digits 3 and 4, each such number must have at least one 3 and at least one 4 in its digits. The third digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except that it can't be both 3 and 4 if we've already used them in the other places. Wait, actually, no, the third digit can be anything, including 3 or 4 again, as long as both 3 and 4 are present somewhere in the number.So, maybe it's better to think about this as permutations where both 3 and 4 appear at least once in the three-digit number. Let me consider the structure of these numbers.Each number is of the form ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit. Since we're dealing with numbers from 500 to 999, A can be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So, A is fixed in the hundreds place, and we need to consider the possibilities for B and C.But wait, actually, A can be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, but in our case, we need the number to contain both 3 and 4. So, if A is 3 or 4, that might affect the counts. Wait, but A is the hundreds digit, which is 5 or higher, so A can't be 3 or 4. So, the hundreds digit is fixed as 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and we need to have both 3 and 4 in the tens and units places.So, that simplifies things a bit. The hundreds digit is fixed as 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and the tens and units digits must include both 3 and 4. So, how many such numbers are there?Let me think. For each hundreds digit (5, 6, 7, 8, 9), we need to count how many two-digit numbers (from 00 to 99) contain both 3 and 4. Then, multiply that count by the number of possible hundreds digits, which is 5.Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is fixed for each case, so maybe it's better to compute for each hundreds digit, how many numbers in the range from A00 to A99 contain both 3 and 4 in their last two digits.So, for each A in {5,6,7,8,9}, we need to count the number of two-digit numbers BC where B and C are digits, and both 3 and 4 appear in B and C.So, how many two-digit numbers BC contain both 3 and 4? Let's calculate that.In the two-digit number BC, both digits must be 3 and 4, but they can be in any order. So, the possible numbers are 34 and 43. So, that's two numbers. But wait, is that all?Wait, no. Because in the two-digit number, the digits can be in any positions, but they have to include both 3 and 4. So, the possible combinations are:- B=3, C=4: number is 34- B=4, C=3: number is 43So, only two possibilities. So, for each hundreds digit A, there are two such numbers: A34 and A43.Therefore, for each A (5,6,7,8,9), we have two numbers. So, total numbers would be 5 * 2 = 10.Wait, but hold on. Is that all? Or are there more possibilities?Wait, no, because in the two-digit number BC, if we allow repetition, but we need both 3 and 4. So, if we have BC as 33, that's only 3s, so that doesn't contain 4. Similarly, 44 only contains 4s. So, the only two-digit numbers that contain both 3 and 4 are 34 and 43.Therefore, for each hundreds digit, there are two such numbers. So, total numbers would be 5 * 2 = 10.But wait, let me think again. Is there a case where the hundreds digit is 3 or 4? But no, because the hundreds digit is from 5 to 9, so it can't be 3 or 4. Therefore, the only way for the number to contain both 3 and 4 is if both are in the last two digits.Therefore, the total number is 10.But wait, hold on. Let me think of another approach to verify.Another way is to calculate the total number of three-digit numbers from 500 to 999, which is 500 numbers (since 999 - 500 + 1 = 500). Then, subtract the numbers that don't contain 3 or don't contain 4.Wait, but that might be more complicated, but let's try.Total numbers: 500.Numbers that don't contain 3: Let's compute how many numbers between 500 and 999 don't have 3 in any digit.Similarly, numbers that don't contain 4.But actually, using inclusion-exclusion principle:Number of numbers containing both 3 and 4 = Total numbers - (numbers without 3 + numbers without 4) + numbers without both 3 and 4.Wait, that's correct. So, let's compute:Total numbers: 500.Numbers without 3: Let's compute how many numbers between 500 and 999 don't have 3 in any digit.Similarly, numbers without 4.First, numbers without 3:- Hundreds digit: can be 5,6,7,8,9 (5 choices)- Tens digit: can be 0-9 except 3 (9 choices)- Units digit: can be 0-9 except 3 (9 choices)So, numbers without 3: 5 * 9 * 9 = 405.Similarly, numbers without 4:- Hundreds digit: 5,6,7,8,9 (5 choices)- Tens digit: 0-9 except 4 (9 choices)- Units digit: 0-9 except 4 (9 choices)So, numbers without 4: 5 * 9 * 9 = 405.Now, numbers without both 3 and 4:- Hundreds digit: 5,6,7,8,9 (5 choices)- Tens digit: 0-9 except 3 and 4 (8 choices)- Units digit: 0-9 except 3 and 4 (8 choices)So, numbers without both 3 and 4: 5 * 8 * 8 = 320.Therefore, using inclusion-exclusion:Numbers with both 3 and 4 = Total - (without 3 + without 4) + without both= 500 - (405 + 405) + 320= 500 - 810 + 320= (500 + 320) - 810= 820 - 810 = 10.So, that confirms the earlier result. There are 10 numbers between 500 and 999 that contain both 3 and 4.Wait, but hold on, let me think again. When we subtract without 3 and without 4, we subtracted the numbers without both 3 and 4 twice, so we need to add them back once. That's why inclusion-exclusion works.So, that gives us 10 numbers, which matches our initial count.But just to make sure, let's list them out.For each hundreds digit from 5 to 9, the numbers are A34 and A43.So:- 534, 543- 634, 643- 734, 743- 834, 843- 934, 943That's 2 numbers for each of the 5 hundreds digits, totaling 10 numbers.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the answer is 10.**Final Answer**The number of integers between 500 and 1000 that contain both the digits 3 and 4 is boxed{10}."},{"question":"Given the line mx + ny - 3 = 0 and the circle x^2 + y^2 = 3 have no common points. If (m, n) are the coordinates of point P, then the number of common points between the line passing through point P and the ellipse frac{x^2}{7} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1 is ________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here. It says that the line mx + ny - 3 = 0 and the circle x² + y² = 3 have no common points. Then, if (m, n) are the coordinates of point P, I need to find the number of common points between the line passing through point P and the ellipse x²/7 + y²/3 = 1.Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, the line and the circle don't intersect, which means the distance from the center of the circle to the line is greater than the radius of the circle. The circle here is x² + y² = 3, so its center is at (0,0) and the radius is sqrt(3). The formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is |Ax₀ + By₀ + C| / sqrt(A² + B²). In this case, the line is mx + ny - 3 = 0, so A = m, B = n, C = -3. The center of the circle is (0,0), so plugging into the distance formula, we get |0 + 0 - 3| / sqrt(m² + n²) = 3 / sqrt(m² + n²). Since the line and the circle have no common points, this distance must be greater than the radius sqrt(3). So, 3 / sqrt(m² + n²) > sqrt(3). Let me write that down:3 / sqrt(m² + n²) > sqrt(3)To solve this inequality, let's square both sides to eliminate the square roots. That gives:(9) / (m² + n²) > 3Simplify this by multiplying both sides by (m² + n²), assuming m² + n² is positive, which it is since it's under a square root in the denominator:9 > 3(m² + n²)Divide both sides by 3:3 > m² + n²So, m² + n² < 3. That means the point P(m, n) lies inside the circle x² + y² = 3.Alright, so now I know that point P is inside this circle. Now, the next part is about a line passing through P intersecting the ellipse x²/7 + y²/3 = 1. I need to find the number of common points between this line and the ellipse.Wait, but the problem says \\"the line passing through point P\\". So, it's not a specific line, but any line through P. Or is it? Hmm, actually, the problem says \\"the line passing through point P\\", so maybe it's referring to a specific line? Wait, no, I think it's asking in general, how many points does a line through P have with the ellipse. But actually, the problem is probably referring to the same line as before, but I'm not sure.Wait, let me read the problem again: \\"the line passing through point P and the ellipse x²/7 + y²/3 = 1\\". So, it's a line passing through P, but not necessarily the same line as before. So, it's any line through P, but the number of intersection points with the ellipse. Hmm, but the problem is asking for the number of common points, so maybe it's a specific line? Or is it in general?Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check: \\"the number of common points between the line passing through point P and the ellipse x²/7 + y²/3 = 1 is ______.\\"Hmm, so it's the number of common points between the line (which passes through P) and the ellipse. So, it's about a line passing through P, but not necessarily the same line as before. So, the problem is asking, given that P is inside the circle x² + y² = 3, what is the number of intersection points between any line through P and the ellipse.Wait, but that can't be, because depending on the line, it can have 0, 1, or 2 points. So, maybe it's asking for the maximum number? Or is there a specific line?Wait, maybe the line is the same as before, but that seems unlikely because the first line doesn't pass through P unless P is on that line. Wait, but P is (m, n), so plugging into the first line: m*m + n*n - 3 = 0? So, m² + n² = 3. But earlier, we found that m² + n² < 3, so P is inside the circle. Therefore, the first line does not pass through P because plugging P into the line equation gives m² + n² - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3 ≠ 0. So, the first line doesn't pass through P.Therefore, the line in question is a different one, passing through P. So, the problem is: given that P is inside the circle x² + y² = 3, how many points does a line passing through P have with the ellipse x²/7 + y²/3 = 1.Wait, but the ellipse is x²/7 + y²/3 = 1. Let me recall that the ellipse has semi-major axis sqrt(7) along the x-axis and semi-minor axis sqrt(3) along the y-axis. The circle x² + y² = 3 has radius sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.732, while the ellipse extends up to sqrt(7) ≈ 2.645 along the x-axis and sqrt(3) along the y-axis.So, the ellipse is larger than the circle in the x-direction but the same in the y-direction. So, the circle is entirely inside the ellipse in the y-direction but not in the x-direction.But point P is inside the circle x² + y² = 3, so it's also inside the ellipse because the ellipse is larger. Therefore, any line passing through P will intersect the ellipse in two points, right? Because if a point is inside the ellipse, any line through it will intersect the ellipse at two points.Wait, but is that always true? Let me think. For an ellipse, if a point is inside, then any line through it will intersect the ellipse at two points. If the point is on the ellipse, the line can be tangent, so one point, or secant, two points. If the point is outside, the line can intersect at two, one, or zero points.But in this case, P is inside the circle x² + y² = 3, and since the ellipse is larger, P is also inside the ellipse. Therefore, any line through P must intersect the ellipse at two points.Wait, but hold on. The ellipse is x²/7 + y²/3 = 1. So, the ellipse is centered at the origin, same as the circle. The circle has radius sqrt(3), and the ellipse has semi-minor axis sqrt(3) and semi-major axis sqrt(7). So, the ellipse is taller in the x-direction but same height as the circle in the y-direction.So, in the y-direction, the ellipse and the circle have the same radius. So, if P is inside the circle, it's also inside the ellipse. Therefore, any line through P will intersect the ellipse at two points.Wait, but is that always the case? For example, if P is at the center, then any line through P will pass through the center and intersect the ellipse at two points. If P is near the edge of the circle, say near (sqrt(3), 0), then a line through P and the center will still intersect the ellipse at two points because the ellipse extends further in the x-direction.Wait, but what if the line is tangent to the ellipse? If P is inside the ellipse, can a line through P be tangent to the ellipse? I think not, because tangents touch the ellipse at exactly one point, but if the point is inside, the line can't be tangent. Let me recall that for a point inside a conic, all lines through it are secant lines, meaning they intersect the conic at two points.Yes, that's correct. For any conic, if a point is inside, then any line through that point will intersect the conic at two points. If the point is on the conic, the line can be tangent or secant. If the point is outside, the line can intersect at two points, one point (tangent), or no points.Therefore, since P is inside the ellipse, any line passing through P must intersect the ellipse at two points. Therefore, the number of common points is two.Wait, but let me verify this. Let me take a specific example. Suppose P is at (0,0), which is inside both the circle and the ellipse. Then, any line through (0,0) will intersect the ellipse at two points, symmetric with respect to the origin. So, that works.Another example: Let P be at (1,1). Since 1² + 1² = 2 < 3, so P is inside the circle. The ellipse is x²/7 + y²/3 = 1. Let's see if the line y = x passes through P (1,1) and intersects the ellipse. Substitute y = x into the ellipse equation: x²/7 + x²/3 = 1. Combine terms: (3x² + 7x²)/21 = 1 => 10x²/21 = 1 => x² = 21/10 => x = ±sqrt(21/10). So, two points: (sqrt(21/10), sqrt(21/10)) and (-sqrt(21/10), -sqrt(21/10)). So, two intersection points.Another example: Let P be at (sqrt(3), 0). Wait, but sqrt(3)² + 0² = 3, so P is on the circle. But in our case, P is inside the circle, so m² + n² < 3. So, P is strictly inside.Wait, but if P is near the edge of the circle, say (sqrt(3) - ε, 0) for a small ε > 0, then the line through P and the origin will intersect the ellipse at two points: one near (sqrt(7), 0) and another near (-sqrt(7), 0). So, still two points.Wait, but what if the line is almost tangent? For example, if P is very close to the edge of the ellipse, but wait, P is inside the circle, which is inside the ellipse. So, P is inside the ellipse, so any line through P can't be tangent to the ellipse.Wait, actually, the ellipse is larger, so even lines that are almost tangent to the circle would still intersect the ellipse at two points.Wait, let me think about the director circle or something. Hmm, maybe not necessary here.Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the line passing through P(m, n) and find its intersection with the ellipse.Let me try that. Let the line passing through P(m, n) have a slope k. Then, the equation of the line is y - n = k(x - m). So, y = kx - km + n.Substitute this into the ellipse equation: x²/7 + y²/3 = 1.So, x²/7 + (kx - km + n)² / 3 = 1.This will be a quadratic equation in x. Let me write it out:x²/7 + [k²x² - 2k²mx + k²m² + 2knx - 2kmn + n²] / 3 = 1.Multiply through by 21 to eliminate denominators:3x² + 7[k²x² - 2k²mx + k²m² + 2knx - 2kmn + n²] = 21.Expand the terms:3x² + 7k²x² - 14k²mx + 7k²m² + 14knx - 14kmn + 7n² = 21.Combine like terms:(3 + 7k²)x² + (-14k²m + 14kn)x + (7k²m² - 14kmn + 7n² - 21) = 0.This is a quadratic in x: Ax² + Bx + C = 0, where:A = 3 + 7k²B = -14k²m + 14knC = 7k²m² - 14kmn + 7n² - 21The discriminant D of this quadratic is B² - 4AC.If D > 0, two real roots; D = 0, one real root; D < 0, no real roots.Since we want to know the number of intersection points, we need to find whether D is positive, zero, or negative.But since P is inside the ellipse, we should expect that D > 0, meaning two intersection points.But let's verify this.Compute D:D = B² - 4AC= [ -14k²m + 14kn ]² - 4*(3 + 7k²)*(7k²m² - 14kmn + 7n² - 21)Let me compute each part step by step.First, compute B²:B² = [ -14k²m + 14kn ]²= (14)^2 [ -k²m + kn ]²= 196 [ k²m - kn ]²= 196 [ k²m - kn ]²= 196 [ k²m - kn ]²Let me factor out k:= 196 [ k (km - n) ]²= 196 k² (km - n)^2Now, compute 4AC:4AC = 4*(3 + 7k²)*(7k²m² - 14kmn + 7n² - 21)Let me factor out 7 from the second term:= 4*(3 + 7k²)*[7(k²m² - 2kmn + n²) - 21]= 4*(3 + 7k²)*[7(km - n)^2 - 21]= 4*(3 + 7k²)*7[(km - n)^2 - 3]= 28*(3 + 7k²)*[(km - n)^2 - 3]So, 4AC = 28*(3 + 7k²)*[(km - n)^2 - 3]Therefore, the discriminant D is:D = 196 k² (km - n)^2 - 28*(3 + 7k²)*[(km - n)^2 - 3]Let me factor out 28 from both terms:D = 28 [7 k² (km - n)^2 - (3 + 7k²)*[(km - n)^2 - 3]]Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:Let me denote S = (km - n)^2 for simplicity.Then, the expression becomes:7k² S - (3 + 7k²)(S - 3)= 7k² S - 3(S - 3) - 7k²(S - 3)= 7k² S - 3S + 9 - 7k² S + 21k²Simplify term by term:7k² S - 7k² S = 0-3S remains+9 remains+21k² remainsSo, overall:= -3S + 9 + 21k²= -3S + 21k² + 9Factor out -3:= -3(S - 7k² - 3)But S = (km - n)^2, so:= -3[(km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3]Therefore, D = 28 * [ -3((km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3) ]= -84 [ (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 ]= -84 [ (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 ]Hmm, so D = -84 [ (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 ]Now, let's compute the term inside the brackets:(km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3= k²m² - 2kmn + n² - 7k² - 3= k²(m² - 7) - 2kmn + n² - 3Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me think differently.Wait, perhaps I can relate this to the condition that P is inside the circle x² + y² = 3. Since P(m, n) is inside, m² + n² < 3.So, let me see if I can express (km - n)^2 in terms of m² + n².Wait, (km - n)^2 = k²m² - 2kmn + n².So, (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 = k²m² - 2kmn + n² - 7k² - 3= k²(m² - 7) - 2kmn + (n² - 3)Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can write this as:= (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3= (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3But I don't see an immediate way to factor this.Wait, maybe I can write it as:= (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3= (km - n)^2 - (7k² + 3)Hmm, perhaps not helpful.Wait, let me think about the discriminant D.We have D = -84 [ (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 ]So, D = -84 [ (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 ]So, the sign of D depends on the term in the brackets.If (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 is positive, then D is negative.If (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 is negative, then D is positive.If it's zero, D is zero.So, let me denote T = (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3.So, D = -84 T.Therefore, D > 0 when T < 0.So, when is T < 0?T = (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 < 0So, (km - n)^2 < 7k² + 3Let me see if I can relate this to m² + n² < 3.Wait, let's expand (km - n)^2:= k²m² - 2kmn + n²So, T = k²m² - 2kmn + n² - 7k² - 3= k²(m² - 7) - 2kmn + (n² - 3)Hmm, not sure. Maybe I can express this in terms of m² + n².Wait, since m² + n² < 3, perhaps we can bound T.But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something.Wait, let me think about T:T = (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3= k²m² - 2kmn + n² - 7k² - 3= k²(m² - 7) - 2kmn + (n² - 3)Hmm, but I don't see a direct relation.Wait, maybe I can write T as:= (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3= (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3Let me consider that (km - n)^2 >= 0, so T >= -7k² - 3, which is always negative because k² is non-negative. So, T can be negative or positive.But we need to know whether T is negative or positive.Wait, but since D = -84 T, so D > 0 when T < 0.So, if T < 0, D > 0, which means two real roots.If T = 0, D = 0, one real root.If T > 0, D < 0, no real roots.So, the question is, is T always negative?Wait, let's see:T = (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3= k²m² - 2kmn + n² - 7k² - 3= k²(m² - 7) - 2kmn + (n² - 3)Hmm, but given that m² + n² < 3, can we say something about T?Wait, m² + n² < 3, so n² < 3 - m².So, T = k²(m² - 7) - 2kmn + (n² - 3)= k²(m² - 7) - 2kmn + n² - 3Since n² < 3 - m², then n² - 3 < -m².So, T < k²(m² - 7) - 2kmn - m²= k²(m² - 7) - m² - 2kmnHmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the maximum value of (km - n)^2.Wait, (km - n)^2 <= (k² + 1)(m² + n²) by Cauchy-Schwarz.Since (km - n)^2 <= (k² + 1)(m² + n²). Because (a·b)^2 <= (a²)(b²) for vectors a and b.Wait, actually, more precisely, (km - n)^2 <= (k² + 1)(m² + n²). Yes, that's correct.So, (km - n)^2 <= (k² + 1)(m² + n²)But since m² + n² < 3, we have:(km - n)^2 < 3(k² + 1)Therefore, T = (km - n)^2 - 7k² - 3 < 3(k² + 1) - 7k² - 3= 3k² + 3 - 7k² - 3= -4k²So, T < -4k²Which is always negative because k² >= 0.Therefore, T < 0 for all k.Therefore, D = -84 T > 0 for all k.Therefore, the discriminant D is always positive, which means the quadratic equation in x has two real roots, meaning the line intersects the ellipse at two points.Therefore, regardless of the slope k, the line through P(m, n) will intersect the ellipse at two points.Therefore, the number of common points is two.Wait, so that's the conclusion. So, the answer is two.But let me just think again: since P is inside the ellipse, any line through P must intersect the ellipse at two points. That makes sense because if a point is inside a conic, any line through it is a secant, hence two intersection points.Therefore, the number of common points is two.**Final Answer**boxed{2}"},{"question":"Among the following events, the number of random events is     .①Throwing two dice twice in a row, and both times getting 2 points; ②On Earth, a pear falling from a tree will fall down if not caught; ③Someone winning the lottery; ④Having one daughter already, then having a boy the second time; ⑤Under standard atmospheric pressure, water heated to 90°C will boil.","answer":"To determine the number of random events among the given options, I need to analyze each event individually.First, I'll consider Event ①: Throwing two dice twice in a row and both times getting 2 points.

This function has the property that for each complex number z, f(z) is equidistant from both z and the origin. Given that |a+bi|=8, find b^2.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a function defined on complex numbers. Let me try to parse it step by step. The function is given by f(z) = (a + bi)z, where a and b are positive numbers. The key property is that for each complex number z, f(z) is equidistant from both z and the origin. Also, we're told that the magnitude of a + bi is 8, and we need to find b squared.Hmm, let me write down what I know:1. f(z) = (a + bi)z. So, this is a linear transformation on the complex plane, essentially a scaling and rotation.2. For every complex number z, the distance from f(z) to z is equal to the distance from f(z) to the origin. So, |f(z) - z| = |f(z) - 0| = |f(z)|.3. |a + bi| = 8. Since a and b are positive, this means sqrt(a² + b²) = 8.Alright, so the first thing I should probably do is translate this condition |f(z) - z| = |f(z)| into an equation involving a and b. Let's let z be a general complex number, say z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then, f(z) = (a + bi)(x + yi).Let me compute f(z):f(z) = (a + bi)(x + yi) = a*x + a*yi + bi*x + bi*yi= (a x - b y) + (a y + b x)iSo, f(z) has real part (a x - b y) and imaginary part (a y + b x).Now, let's compute |f(z) - z| and |f(z)|.First, f(z) - z = [(a x - b y) - x] + [(a y + b x) - y]i= [(a - 1)x - b y] + [(a)y + (b - 1)x]iWait, hold on, let me compute that again:Wait, z is x + yi, so f(z) - z is [(a x - b y) - x] + [(a y + b x) - y]i= (a x - b y - x) + (a y + b x - y)i= ( (a - 1)x - b y ) + ( a y + (b - 1)x )iSo, the real part is (a - 1)x - b y, and the imaginary part is a y + (b - 1)x.Then, |f(z) - z| is the modulus of this, which is sqrt[ ((a - 1)x - b y)^2 + (a y + (b - 1)x)^2 ]Similarly, |f(z)| is sqrt[ (a x - b y)^2 + (a y + b x)^2 ]The condition is that these two moduli are equal for all z, which is for all x and y. So, the expressions under the square roots must be equal for all x and y. Therefore, we can set up the equation:[ ((a - 1)x - b y)^2 + (a y + (b - 1)x)^2 ] = [ (a x - b y)^2 + (a y + b x)^2 ]Let me write this out:Left side: [ ( (a - 1)x - b y )^2 + ( a y + (b - 1)x )^2 ]Right side: [ (a x - b y)^2 + (a y + b x)^2 ]Let me expand both sides.First, expand the left side:First term: ( (a - 1)x - b y )^2= (a - 1)^2 x^2 - 2(a - 1)b x y + b² y²Second term: ( a y + (b - 1)x )^2= a² y² + 2a(b - 1) x y + (b - 1)^2 x²So, adding them together:Left side = (a - 1)^2 x² - 2(a - 1)b x y + b² y² + a² y² + 2a(b - 1) x y + (b - 1)^2 x²Similarly, expand the right side:First term: (a x - b y)^2= a² x² - 2ab x y + b² y²Second term: (a y + b x)^2= a² y² + 2ab x y + b² x²Adding them:Right side = a² x² - 2ab x y + b² y² + a² y² + 2ab x y + b² x²= (a² + b²) x² + (a² + b²) y²Wait, because the cross terms (-2ab x y and +2ab x y) cancel out, so we're left with a² x² + b² y² + a² y² + b² x², which is (a² + b²)(x² + y²). That's nice.Now, let's go back to the left side. Let me collect like terms.Left side:First, x² terms: (a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2Then, x y terms: -2(a - 1)b + 2a(b - 1)Then, y² terms: b² + a²So, let's compute each part.Compute x² coefficient:(a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 = (a² - 2a + 1) + (b² - 2b + 1) = a² + b² - 2a - 2b + 2Compute x y coefficient:-2(a - 1)b + 2a(b - 1) = -2ab + 2b + 2ab - 2a = (-2ab + 2ab) + (2b - 2a) = 0 + 2(b - a) = 2(b - a)Compute y² coefficient:b² + a²So, putting it all together, the left side is:[ a² + b² - 2a - 2b + 2 ] x² + [ 2(b - a) ] x y + [ a² + b² ] y²And the right side is:[ a² + b² ] x² + [ a² + b² ] y²So, for these two expressions to be equal for all x and y, their corresponding coefficients must be equal.Therefore, we can set up equations for the coefficients:1. Coefficient of x²: a² + b² - 2a - 2b + 2 = a² + b²2. Coefficient of x y: 2(b - a) = 03. Coefficient of y²: a² + b² = a² + b² (which is always true, so no new information)Let me write these equations:From equation 2: 2(b - a) = 0 => b - a = 0 => b = aFrom equation 1: a² + b² - 2a - 2b + 2 = a² + b²Subtract a² + b² from both sides: -2a - 2b + 2 = 0Simplify: -2(a + b) + 2 = 0 => -2(a + b) = -2 => a + b = 1But we also have from equation 2 that b = a. So, substituting b = a into a + b = 1:a + a = 1 => 2a = 1 => a = 1/2Therefore, since b = a, b = 1/2 as well.But wait, hold on. The problem states that |a + bi| = 8. So, sqrt(a² + b²) = 8.But if a = b = 1/2, then sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 1/4) = sqrt(1/2) ≈ 0.707, which is nowhere near 8. That's a problem.Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.Wait, so in equation 1, we had a² + b² - 2a - 2b + 2 = a² + b², which simplifies to -2a - 2b + 2 = 0, so 2a + 2b = 2, so a + b = 1.But if a + b = 1, and a = b, then a = b = 1/2, but that contradicts |a + bi| = 8.So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake in expanding the expressions.Wait, let me double-check the expansion of the left side.Left side: [ ( (a - 1)x - b y )^2 + ( a y + (b - 1)x )^2 ]First term: ( (a - 1)x - b y )^2 = (a - 1)^2 x² - 2(a - 1)b x y + b² y²Second term: ( a y + (b - 1)x )^2 = a² y² + 2a(b - 1)x y + (b - 1)^2 x²Adding them:= (a - 1)^2 x² + (b - 1)^2 x² + (-2(a - 1)b + 2a(b - 1)) x y + (b² + a²) y²Wait, so that is correct.Then, the x² coefficient: (a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2x y coefficient: -2(a - 1)b + 2a(b - 1)y² coefficient: b² + a²So, that seems correct.Then, setting equal to the right side, which is (a² + b²)(x² + y²)So, equate coefficients:x²: (a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 = a² + b²x y: -2(a - 1)b + 2a(b - 1) = 0y²: a² + b² = a² + b², which is always true.So, equation 1: (a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 = a² + b²Equation 2: -2(a - 1)b + 2a(b - 1) = 0Let me expand equation 1:(a² - 2a + 1) + (b² - 2b + 1) = a² + b²Simplify: a² - 2a + 1 + b² - 2b + 1 = a² + b²Combine like terms: (a² + b²) - 2a - 2b + 2 = a² + b²Subtract a² + b²: -2a - 2b + 2 = 0 => -2(a + b) + 2 = 0 => 2(a + b) = 2 => a + b = 1So that's correct.Equation 2: -2(a - 1)b + 2a(b - 1) = 0Let me expand this:-2ab + 2b + 2ab - 2a = 0Simplify: (-2ab + 2ab) + (2b - 2a) = 0 => 0 + 2(b - a) = 0 => 2(b - a) = 0 => b = aSo, that's correct too.So, from equation 2, b = a, and from equation 1, a + b = 1. So, a = b = 1/2.But then |a + bi| = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 1/4) = sqrt(1/2) ≈ 0.707, which is not 8. So, that's a problem.Wait, so maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere.Wait, the problem says that for each complex number z, f(z) is equidistant from z and the origin. So, |f(z) - z| = |f(z)|.But perhaps I should think about this geometrically instead of algebraically. Maybe that would help.In the complex plane, f(z) is a linear transformation, which is a scaling and rotation. The condition is that f(z) is equidistant from z and 0 for every z. So, for every z, f(z) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining z and 0.But the perpendicular bisector of z and 0 is the set of points equidistant from z and 0, which is the line (in complex plane) that is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from 0 to z.But for this to hold for every z, f must map every z to a point on the perpendicular bisector of z and 0. That seems like a very restrictive condition.Alternatively, perhaps f is a reflection or something. Wait, but f is a linear transformation, so it's a scaling and rotation.Wait, if f(z) is equidistant from z and 0 for all z, then f(z) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of z and 0 for every z. So, the image of z under f lies on that bisector.But the perpendicular bisector of z and 0 is the set of points w such that |w - z| = |w|.Which is exactly the condition given: |f(z) - z| = |f(z)|.So, for each z, f(z) lies on the perpendicular bisector of z and 0.But since f is linear, this must hold for all z. So, perhaps f is a reflection over some line, but since it's a complex linear transformation, it must be a rotation and scaling.Wait, but reflections are anti-linear, not linear, unless the reflection is over a line through the origin, which would be a linear transformation. Hmm, but in that case, it would be a reflection, which is a specific kind of linear transformation.But f(z) = (a + bi)z is a linear transformation, which can be represented as a matrix:[ a  -b ][ b   a ]So, it's a rotation and scaling matrix.So, perhaps the condition that f(z) lies on the perpendicular bisector for every z imposes some condition on a and b.Alternatively, maybe we can think of this as f(z) being the midpoint between z and some other point, but that might not be the case.Wait, another approach: Since |f(z) - z| = |f(z)| for all z, we can write this as |f(z) - z|² = |f(z)|².Compute both sides squared:|f(z) - z|² = |f(z)|²Which expands to:(f(z) - z)(overline{f(z) - z}) = f(z) overline{f(z)}But since f(z) is linear, f(z) = (a + bi)z, so overline{f(z)} = (a - bi)overline{z}So, let's compute |f(z) - z|²:= |(a + bi)z - z|² = |(a + bi - 1)z|² = |(a - 1 + bi)z|² = |a - 1 + bi|² |z|²Similarly, |f(z)|² = |(a + bi)z|² = |a + bi|² |z|²So, setting them equal:|a - 1 + bi|² |z|² = |a + bi|² |z|²Since this holds for all z, including z ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by |z|²:|a - 1 + bi|² = |a + bi|²Compute both magnitudes squared:Left side: (a - 1)^2 + b^2Right side: a^2 + b^2Set equal:(a - 1)^2 + b^2 = a^2 + b^2Simplify:(a² - 2a + 1) + b² = a² + b²Subtract a² + b² from both sides:-2a + 1 = 0 => -2a + 1 = 0 => 2a = 1 => a = 1/2So, a = 1/2.But we also know that |a + bi| = 8, so sqrt(a² + b²) = 8.Given that a = 1/2, then sqrt( (1/2)^2 + b^2 ) = 8Compute:sqrt(1/4 + b²) = 8Square both sides:1/4 + b² = 64Subtract 1/4:b² = 64 - 1/4 = 256/4 - 1/4 = 255/4So, b² = 255/4.Wait, that seems different from my earlier conclusion where I thought a = b = 1/2, but that was when I mistakenly considered both a and b equal, but actually, from the equation |a - 1 + bi|² = |a + bi|², we only get a = 1/2, and then b is determined from |a + bi| = 8.So, that was my mistake earlier. I incorrectly assumed that both a and b were equal, but actually, from the condition |f(z) - z| = |f(z)|, we only get a = 1/2, and then b is found from |a + bi| = 8.So, let me recap:1. From |f(z) - z| = |f(z)| for all z, we derived that |a - 1 + bi|² = |a + bi|².2. This simplifies to (a - 1)^2 + b^2 = a^2 + b^2, leading to a = 1/2.3. Then, using |a + bi| = 8, which is sqrt(a² + b²) = 8, we substitute a = 1/2:sqrt( (1/2)^2 + b^2 ) = 8sqrt(1/4 + b²) = 8Square both sides:1/4 + b² = 64So, b² = 64 - 1/4 = 255/4.Therefore, b² = 255/4.So, the answer is 255/4, which is 63.75, but since the question asks for b², we can write it as 255/4.Wait, let me double-check this result.Given a = 1/2, b² = 255/4.Compute |a + bi|:sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(255/4))^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 255/4) = sqrt(256/4) = sqrt(64) = 8, which matches the given condition.Also, check the condition |f(z) - z| = |f(z)|.With a = 1/2, f(z) = (1/2 + bi)z.Compute |f(z) - z|:= |(1/2 + bi - 1)z| = |(-1/2 + bi)z| = sqrt( (-1/2)^2 + b^2 ) |z| = sqrt(1/4 + b²) |z| = sqrt(64) |z| = 8|z|Compute |f(z)|:= |(1/2 + bi)z| = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + b² ) |z| = sqrt(1/4 + b²) |z| = sqrt(64) |z| = 8|z|So, indeed, |f(z) - z| = |f(z)|, which satisfies the condition.Therefore, the correct value is b² = 255/4.I think that makes sense now. Earlier, I mistakenly thought both a and b had to be 1/2, but that was incorrect because the condition only constrains a, not b. So, with a = 1/2, we solve for b using the magnitude condition.**Final Answer**The value of ( b^2 ) is boxed{dfrac{255}{4}}."},{"question":"There are 3 boys and 2 girls lining up for a photo, with the requirement that the girls must be adjacent.

This means I now have 4 units to arrange: the three boys and the one girl unit.There are 4 units in total, so the number of ways to arrange these units is 4 factorial, which is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.However, within the girl unit, the two girls can switch places. There are 2 ways to arrange the two girls within their unit.Therefore, the total number of possible arrangements is 24 × 2 = 48 ways."},{"question":"If the function f(x) = f'(1)x^3 - 2x^2 + 3, find the value of f'(2).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: the function f(x) is given as f'(1)x³ minus 2x² plus 3. And I need to find the value of f'(2). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the function to make it clearer. The function is f(x) = f'(1)x³ - 2x² + 3. So, f(x) is expressed in terms of its derivative at x=1. That seems a bit tricky because usually, functions are given without referencing their derivatives. But I think I can handle this.I remember that to find the derivative of a function, I can use the power rule. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1). So, let me try to find f'(x) first.Given f(x) = f'(1)x³ - 2x² + 3, let's differentiate term by term.The derivative of f'(1)x³ with respect to x is 3*f'(1)x². Because the derivative of x³ is 3x², and f'(1) is just a constant coefficient here.Next, the derivative of -2x² is -4x. Again, using the power rule: 2 times x² is 2x, but since it's negative, it becomes -4x.Lastly, the derivative of the constant term, 3, is 0. Because the slope of a constant is zero.So putting it all together, f'(x) = 3*f'(1)x² - 4x.Okay, so now I have an expression for f'(x) in terms of f'(1). But I need to find f'(2). Hmm, but to find f'(2), I need to know f'(1) first, right? Because f'(x) depends on f'(1). So, I think I need to find the value of f'(1) first.Wait, how can I find f'(1)? Well, since f'(x) is the derivative of f(x), and f'(1) is just the value of the derivative at x=1. So, if I plug x=1 into the expression for f'(x), I should get f'(1).Let me write that down. So, f'(1) = 3*f'(1)*(1)² - 4*(1). Simplifying this, (1)² is 1, so it becomes f'(1) = 3*f'(1) - 4.Hmm, okay, so f'(1) = 3*f'(1) - 4. Let me solve for f'(1). Subtract 3*f'(1) from both sides: f'(1) - 3*f'(1) = -4. That simplifies to -2*f'(1) = -4.Dividing both sides by -2, I get f'(1) = (-4)/(-2) = 2. So, f'(1) is 2. Got it.Now that I know f'(1) is 2, I can plug this back into the expression for f'(x). Earlier, I had f'(x) = 3*f'(1)x² - 4x. Substituting f'(1) = 2, this becomes f'(x) = 3*2*x² - 4x, which simplifies to f'(x) = 6x² - 4x.Alright, so now I have f'(x) = 6x² - 4x. Now, the question asks for f'(2). So, I just need to plug x=2 into this derivative.Let me compute that: f'(2) = 6*(2)² - 4*(2). Calculating each term, (2)² is 4, so 6*4 is 24. Then, 4*2 is 8. So, f'(2) = 24 - 8 = 16.Wait, let me double-check that. 6*(2)^2 is 6*4=24, and 4*2=8. So, 24 - 8 is indeed 16. Okay, that seems correct.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier, let me recap:1. I started with f(x) = f'(1)x³ - 2x² + 3.2. I found f'(x) by differentiating term by term, which gave me f'(x) = 3*f'(1)x² - 4x.3. Then, I plugged x=1 into f'(x) to get f'(1) = 3*f'(1) - 4.4. Solving for f'(1), I found it equals 2.5. Substituted f'(1) back into f'(x), resulting in f'(x) = 6x² - 4x.6. Finally, evaluated f'(2) to get 16.Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just verify the differentiation step again to be absolutely sure.Differentiating f(x) = f'(1)x³ - 2x² + 3:- The derivative of f'(1)x³ is 3*f'(1)x².- The derivative of -2x² is -4x.- The derivative of 3 is 0.Yes, that's correct. So, f'(x) = 3*f'(1)x² - 4x. Then, plugging in x=1:f'(1) = 3*f'(1)*(1) - 4*1 => f'(1) = 3*f'(1) - 4.Solving for f'(1):f'(1) - 3*f'(1) = -4 => -2*f'(1) = -4 => f'(1) = 2.Perfect. Then, f'(x) becomes 6x² - 4x, and f'(2) is 6*(4) - 8 = 24 - 8 = 16.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations.**Final Answer**The value of ( f'(2) ) is boxed{16}."},{"question":"Given the plane vectors overrightarrow {a}=(4^{x}, 2^{x}) and overrightarrow {b}=(1, frac {2^{x}-2}{2^{x}}), where xinmathbb{R}, if overrightarrow {a} perp overrightarrow {b}, then |overrightarrow {a}- overrightarrow {b}|= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the magnitude of the vector difference between vectors a and b, given that they are perpendicular. The vectors are defined as a = (4^x, 2^x) and b = (1, (2^x - 2)/2^x), where x is a real number. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, I should start by calculating the dot product of vectors a and b and set it equal to zero. That should give me an equation to solve for x.Let me write down the vectors:Vector a = (4^x, 2^x)Vector b = (1, (2^x - 2)/2^x)So, the dot product a · b is:(4^x)(1) + (2^x)((2^x - 2)/2^x) = 0Simplify each term:First term: 4^x * 1 = 4^xSecond term: 2^x * ((2^x - 2)/2^x) = (2^x * (2^x - 2)) / 2^xWait, the 2^x in the numerator and denominator should cancel out, right? So, that simplifies to (2^x - 2). So, the second term is just (2^x - 2).Therefore, the dot product equation becomes:4^x + (2^x - 2) = 0So, 4^x + 2^x - 2 = 0Hmm, okay. Now, I need to solve this equation for x. Let me see if I can express everything in terms of 2^x because 4^x is (2^2)^x = 2^(2x). So, 4^x = (2^x)^2.Let me set y = 2^x. Then, 4^x = y^2. So, substituting into the equation:y^2 + y - 2 = 0That's a quadratic equation in terms of y: y^2 + y - 2 = 0Let me solve for y using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is y^2 + y - 2 = 0, so a = 1, b = 1, c = -2.Discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4*1*(-2) = 1 + 8 = 9So, solutions are y = [-b ± sqrt(D)] / (2a) = [-1 ± 3]/2So, two solutions:1) y = (-1 + 3)/2 = 2/2 = 12) y = (-1 - 3)/2 = -4/2 = -2But y = 2^x, and since 2^x is always positive, y cannot be negative. So, y = -2 is not a valid solution.Therefore, y = 1, which means 2^x = 1Solving for x: 2^x = 1 implies x = 0, since 2^0 = 1.Okay, so x = 0. Now, I need to find |a - b|, the magnitude of the vector a - b.First, let's compute vector a - vector b.Vector a = (4^x, 2^x) = (4^0, 2^0) = (1, 1)Vector b = (1, (2^x - 2)/2^x) = (1, (1 - 2)/1) = (1, (-1)/1) = (1, -1)So, vector a - vector b = (1 - 1, 1 - (-1)) = (0, 2)Now, the magnitude of this vector is sqrt(0^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(0 + 4) = sqrt(4) = 2Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I found the dot product correctly: 4^x + (2^x - 2) = 0. Then, substituted y = 2^x, leading to y^2 + y - 2 = 0. Solved for y, got y = 1, so x = 0. Then, substituted x = 0 into vectors a and b, got a = (1,1) and b = (1, -1). Then, subtracted to get (0,2), and magnitude is 2.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe without solving for x first?Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of 2^x and see if I can find |a - b| directly. Let me try that.Given a = (4^x, 2^x) and b = (1, (2^x - 2)/2^x)Compute a - b:First component: 4^x - 1Second component: 2^x - (2^x - 2)/2^xSimplify the second component:2^x - (2^x - 2)/2^x = [2^x * 2^x - (2^x - 2)] / 2^xWait, let me compute it step by step.Second component:2^x - [(2^x - 2)/2^x] = 2^x - (2^x)/2^x + 2/2^x = 2^x - 1 + 2/2^xSimplify:2^x - 1 + 2/2^xHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to compute it as:2^x - (2^x - 2)/2^x = (2^{2x} - (2^x - 2)) / 2^xWait, let's compute numerator:2^{2x} - (2^x - 2) = 2^{2x} - 2^x + 2So, second component is (2^{2x} - 2^x + 2)/2^xHmm, but perhaps this approach is more complicated. Maybe I should stick with my initial approach where I found x = 0, then computed |a - b|.Alternatively, maybe I can express |a - b| in terms of x and then use the fact that a and b are perpendicular, so maybe there's a relationship between |a|, |b|, and |a - b|.Wait, I remember that if two vectors are perpendicular, then |a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2, because the dot product term cancels out. Let me verify that.Yes, in general, |a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2(a · b). But since a · b = 0, this simplifies to |a|^2 + |b|^2.So, if I can compute |a| and |b|, then |a - b| is sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2).Let me try that approach.First, compute |a|:|a| = sqrt((4^x)^2 + (2^x)^2) = sqrt(16^x + 4^x)Wait, 4^x squared is (4^x)^2 = 16^x, and (2^x)^2 = 4^x. So, |a| = sqrt(16^x + 4^x)Similarly, compute |b|:Vector b = (1, (2^x - 2)/2^x)So, |b| = sqrt(1^2 + [(2^x - 2)/2^x]^2) = sqrt(1 + [(2^x - 2)/2^x]^2)Let me compute [(2^x - 2)/2^x]^2:= (2^x - 2)^2 / (2^x)^2 = (4^x - 4*2^x + 4) / 4^xSo, |b| = sqrt(1 + (4^x - 4*2^x + 4)/4^x)Simplify inside the square root:1 + (4^x - 4*2^x + 4)/4^x = [4^x + 4^x - 4*2^x + 4] / 4^xWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me see:Wait, 1 is equal to 4^x / 4^x, so:1 + (4^x - 4*2^x + 4)/4^x = (4^x + 4^x - 4*2^x + 4) / 4^xWait, that would be 2*4^x - 4*2^x + 4, all over 4^x.But that seems messy. Maybe I should instead factor 4^x as (2^x)^2.Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to just compute |a - b| directly once I have x.Since I already found x = 0, and |a - b| = 2, perhaps that's the simplest way.But just to make sure, let me compute |a| and |b| when x = 0.At x = 0:Vector a = (1, 1), so |a| = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2)Vector b = (1, -1), so |b| = sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)Then, |a - b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2) = sqrt(2 + 2) = sqrt(4) = 2Which matches my previous result.Alternatively, if I didn't know x = 0, could I express |a - b| in terms of x and then find its value?Let me try that.Compute |a - b|:First component: 4^x - 1Second component: 2^x - (2^x - 2)/2^xAs I started earlier, let's compute the second component:2^x - (2^x - 2)/2^x = 2^x - 1 + 2/2^xSo, the second component is 2^x - 1 + 2/2^xTherefore, vector a - b = (4^x - 1, 2^x - 1 + 2/2^x)Then, |a - b| = sqrt[(4^x - 1)^2 + (2^x - 1 + 2/2^x)^2]Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe we can simplify it.Let me denote y = 2^x, so 4^x = y^2.Then, vector a - b becomes:First component: y^2 - 1Second component: y - 1 + 2/ySo, |a - b| = sqrt[(y^2 - 1)^2 + (y - 1 + 2/y)^2]Let me compute each part:First part: (y^2 - 1)^2 = (y - 1)^2(y + 1)^2Second part: (y - 1 + 2/y)^2Let me expand the second part:= [ (y - 1) + (2/y) ]^2 = (y - 1)^2 + 2*(y - 1)*(2/y) + (2/y)^2= (y^2 - 2y + 1) + (4(y - 1)/y) + 4/y^2So, putting it all together:|a - b|^2 = (y^2 - 1)^2 + (y^2 - 2y + 1) + (4(y - 1)/y) + 4/y^2Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.Wait, but earlier we found that x = 0, so y = 1. Let me plug y = 1 into this expression:First component: y^2 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0Second component: y - 1 + 2/y = 1 - 1 + 2/1 = 2So, |a - b| = sqrt(0^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(4) = 2Which is consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can find |a - b| without computing x by using the fact that a · b = 0.We know that |a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2(a · b). Since a · b = 0, this simplifies to |a|^2 + |b|^2.So, if I can compute |a|^2 and |b|^2, then |a - b| is sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2).Let me compute |a|^2:|a|^2 = (4^x)^2 + (2^x)^2 = 16^x + 4^xSimilarly, |b|^2 = 1^2 + [(2^x - 2)/2^x]^2 = 1 + [(2^x - 2)^2]/(2^x)^2Compute [(2^x - 2)^2]/(2^x)^2:= (4^x - 4*2^x + 4)/4^x = 1 - 4*2^x / 4^x + 4/4^xBut 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^{2x}, so 4*2^x / 4^x = 4*2^x / 2^{2x} = 4 / 2^x = 2^{2} / 2^x = 2^{2 - x}Similarly, 4 / 4^x = 4 / (2^{2x}) = 2^2 / 2^{2x} = 2^{2 - 2x}So, [(2^x - 2)^2]/(2^x)^2 = 1 - 2^{2 - x} + 2^{2 - 2x}Therefore, |b|^2 = 1 + 1 - 2^{2 - x} + 2^{2 - 2x} = 2 - 2^{2 - x} + 2^{2 - 2x}Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe we can express everything in terms of y = 2^x again.Let me set y = 2^x, so 4^x = y^2.Then, |a|^2 = y^4 + y^2And |b|^2 = 2 - 2^{2 - x} + 2^{2 - 2x} = 2 - (2^2)/(2^x) + (2^2)/(2^{2x}) = 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2So, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2Hmm, that's still complicated. Maybe if I factor it or find a common denominator.Alternatively, perhaps I can write everything in terms of y and see if it simplifies.Wait, let me compute |a|^2 + |b|^2:= y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2Let me write all terms with denominator y^2:= y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2= (y^6)/y^2 + (y^4)/y^2 + (2y^2)/y^2 - (4y)/y^2 + 4/y^2Wait, that seems more complicated. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2.Let me see:y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2Hmm, maybe group terms:= (y^4 + y^2) + (2) + (-4/y + 4/y^2)= y^2(y^2 + 1) + 2 + (-4/y + 4/y^2)Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps factor as a quadratic in terms of y^2.Wait, let me make a substitution: let z = y^2. Then, y^4 = z^2, y^2 = z, and 1/y^2 = 1/z, 1/y = 1/sqrt(z). Hmm, but that might not help.Alternatively, perhaps multiply numerator and denominator by y^2 to eliminate the fractions.Wait, but since this is |a|^2 + |b|^2, which is equal to |a - b|^2, and since we know that a · b = 0, perhaps there's a relationship.Wait, but I already know that |a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 because a and b are perpendicular.But without knowing x, it's hard to compute |a|^2 + |b|^2. So, maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach where I found x = 0, then computed |a - b| = 2.Alternatively, maybe I can find |a - b| in terms of x without computing x first.Wait, let me think. Since a · b = 0, and |a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2, maybe I can express |a|^2 + |b|^2 in terms of x and see if it simplifies.Compute |a|^2 + |b|^2:= (4^x)^2 + (2^x)^2 + 1 + [(2^x - 2)/2^x]^2= 16^x + 4^x + 1 + (4^x - 4*2^x + 4)/4^xSimplify the last term:(4^x - 4*2^x + 4)/4^x = 1 - 4*2^x / 4^x + 4 / 4^x= 1 - 4 / 2^x + 4 / 4^x= 1 - 4 / 2^x + 4 / (2^x)^2So, |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 16^x + 4^x + 1 + 1 - 4 / 2^x + 4 / (2^x)^2Simplify:= 16^x + 4^x + 2 - 4 / 2^x + 4 / (2^x)^2Hmm, this is the same expression as before. Maybe I can factor this expression.Let me write it as:16^x + 4^x + 2 - 4 / 2^x + 4 / (2^x)^2Let me set y = 2^x, so 4^x = y^2, 16^x = y^4, 1/2^x = 1/y, and 1/(2^x)^2 = 1/y^2.So, substituting:= y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2Hmm, perhaps this can be factored as a perfect square.Let me see:y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2Hmm, maybe group terms:= y^4 + y^2 + 2 + (-4/y + 4/y^2)= y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2Wait, maybe factor the last three terms:-4/y + 4/y^2 = -4(1/y - 1/y^2) = -4(y - 1)/y^2Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps write the entire expression as (y^2 + something)^2.Wait, let me try:Suppose it's (y^2 + a y + b)^2, but that might not work.Alternatively, perhaps it's (y^2 + c + d/y)^2.Let me try expanding (y^2 + c + d/y)^2:= y^4 + 2c y^2 + c^2 + 2d y + 2c d / y + d^2 / y^2Compare with our expression: y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2So, matching coefficients:y^4: 1 = 1, okay.y^2: 2c = 1 ⇒ c = 1/2Constant term: c^2 + 2d = 2 ⇒ (1/2)^2 + 2d = 2 ⇒ 1/4 + 2d = 2 ⇒ 2d = 7/4 ⇒ d = 7/8But then, the term with 1/y: 2c d = 2*(1/2)*(7/8) = 7/8, but in our expression, it's -4/y, so 7/8 ≠ -4. So, that doesn't match.Alternatively, maybe try a different form.Alternatively, perhaps the expression is a perfect square of (y^2 - something + something/y)^2.Let me try:(y^2 - a + b/y)^2 = y^4 - 2a y^2 + a^2 + 2b y - 2a b / y + b^2 / y^2Compare with our expression: y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2So, set up equations:1. Coefficient of y^4: 1 = 1, okay.2. Coefficient of y^2: -2a = 1 ⇒ a = -1/23. Constant term: a^2 + 2b = 2 ⇒ (-1/2)^2 + 2b = 2 ⇒ 1/4 + 2b = 2 ⇒ 2b = 7/4 ⇒ b = 7/84. Coefficient of 1/y: -2a b = -4 ⇒ -2*(-1/2)*(7/8) = (7/8) = 7/8, but we have -4, so 7/8 ≠ -4. Doesn't match.Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Perhaps the expression isn't a perfect square.Alternatively, maybe I can factor it as (y^2 + something)(something else).Alternatively, perhaps substitute z = y + 1/y, but not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2 = y^4 + y^2 + 2 + (-4/y + 4/y^2)= y^4 + y^2 + 2 + (-4y + 4)/y^2Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as y^4 + y^2 + 2 + 4(1/y^2 - 1/y)But I don't see an obvious way to factor this.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that y = 2^x, and since we found x = 0, y = 1, so plugging y = 1 into the expression:y^4 + y^2 + 2 - 4/y + 4/y^2 = 1 + 1 + 2 - 4 + 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 - 4 + 4 = 4So, |a - b|^2 = 4, so |a - b| = 2.Which again gives the same result.Therefore, regardless of the approach, I end up with |a - b| = 2.I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 2.**Final Answer**boxed{2}"},{"question":"If the function f(x)=ax^{3}-2x^{2}+a^{2}x has a local minimum at x=1, then the real number a is ____.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: the function f(x) = a x³ - 2x² + a² x has a local minimum at x = 1. I need to find the real number a. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that to find local minima or maxima, we need to use calculus, specifically the first and second derivative tests. So, I should start by finding the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x. Let me write that out.f(x) = a x³ - 2x² + a² xSo, the first derivative, f'(x), would be:f'(x) = d/dx [a x³] - d/dx [2x²] + d/dx [a² x]Calculating each term:- The derivative of a x³ is 3a x².- The derivative of -2x² is -4x.- The derivative of a² x is a².Putting it all together:f'(x) = 3a x² - 4x + a²Okay, so that's the first derivative. Now, since we're told that there's a local minimum at x = 1, that means that x = 1 is a critical point. Critical points occur where the first derivative is zero or undefined. Since f'(x) is a polynomial, it's defined everywhere, so we just need to set f'(1) = 0.Let's plug x = 1 into f'(x):f'(1) = 3a (1)² - 4(1) + a² = 3a - 4 + a²Set this equal to zero:3a - 4 + a² = 0So, we have a quadratic equation in terms of a:a² + 3a - 4 = 0Hmm, let me solve for a. I can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic is a² + 3a - 4 = 0, so the coefficients are:A = 1, B = 3, C = -4The quadratic formula is:a = [-B ± sqrt(B² - 4AC)] / (2A)Plugging in the values:a = [-3 ± sqrt(9 - 4*1*(-4))]/2a = [-3 ± sqrt(9 + 16)]/2a = [-3 ± sqrt(25)]/2a = [-3 ± 5]/2So, that gives two solutions:1. a = (-3 + 5)/2 = 2/2 = 12. a = (-3 - 5)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4Alright, so a can be either 1 or -4. But wait, the problem says that x = 1 is a local minimum. So, we need to ensure that this critical point is indeed a minimum. For that, we can use the second derivative test.Let me find the second derivative, f''(x). Starting from f'(x) = 3a x² - 4x + a²Taking the derivative again:f''(x) = d/dx [3a x²] - d/dx [4x] + d/dx [a²]Calculating each term:- The derivative of 3a x² is 6a x.- The derivative of -4x is -4.- The derivative of a² is 0, since it's a constant.So, f''(x) = 6a x - 4Now, evaluate the second derivative at x = 1:f''(1) = 6a (1) - 4 = 6a - 4For x = 1 to be a local minimum, the second derivative at that point must be positive. So, we have:6a - 4 > 0Solving for a:6a > 4a > 4/6a > 2/3So, a must be greater than 2/3. Now, looking back at our solutions for a, which were a = 1 and a = -4.- For a = 1: 1 > 2/3, which is true. So, a = 1 is valid.- For a = -4: -4 > 2/3? No, that's false. So, a = -4 is not valid.Therefore, the only valid solution is a = 1.Wait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first derivative: 3a x² - 4x + a², correct. Plugging in x = 1: 3a - 4 + a² = 0, correct. Quadratic equation: a² + 3a - 4 = 0, correct. Solutions: a = 1 and a = -4, correct.Second derivative: 6a x - 4, correct. At x = 1, 6a - 4 > 0, so a > 2/3. So, a = 1 is okay, a = -4 is not. So, yeah, a must be 1.Just to be thorough, let me plug a = 1 back into the original function and see if x = 1 is indeed a local minimum.f(x) = 1 x³ - 2x² + (1)² x = x³ - 2x² + xCompute f'(x) = 3x² - 4x + 1Set f'(1) = 3(1) - 4(1) + 1 = 3 - 4 + 1 = 0, which is correct.Compute f''(x) = 6x - 4f''(1) = 6(1) - 4 = 2 > 0, so it's a local minimum. Perfect.What about a = -4? Let's see why it doesn't work.f(x) = (-4)x³ - 2x² + (-4)² x = -4x³ - 2x² + 16xCompute f'(x) = -12x² - 4x + 16Set f'(1) = -12(1) - 4(1) + 16 = -12 - 4 + 16 = 0, which is correct.Compute f''(x) = -24x - 4f''(1) = -24(1) - 4 = -28 < 0, which would mean it's a local maximum, not a minimum. So, that's why a = -4 is invalid.Therefore, the only valid solution is a = 1.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The real number ( a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} where the product of the first five terms a_1 cdot a_2 cdot ldots cdot a_5 = 32, find a_3.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, if the first term is a₁, then the second term is a₁*r, the third term is a₁*r², and so on. In general, the nth term is a₁*r^(n-1).The problem says that the product of the first five terms is 32. I need to find the third term, a₃. Hmm, okay. Let me write down the first five terms:a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄, a₅.Since it's a geometric sequence, each term can be expressed in terms of a₁ and r:a₁ = a₁a₂ = a₁*ra₃ = a₁*r²a₄ = a₁*r³a₅ = a₁*r⁴So, the product of these five terms is a₁ * a₂ * a₃ * a₄ * a₅. Let me write that out:a₁ * (a₁*r) * (a₁*r²) * (a₁*r³) * (a₁*r⁴)Hmm, that's a lot of multiplication. Let me see if I can simplify this expression. First, let's multiply all the a₁ terms together. There are five a₁ terms, so that would be (a₁)^5.Now, for the r terms: r * r² * r³ * r⁴. When multiplying exponents with the same base, we add the exponents. So, r^(1+2+3+4). Let me calculate that exponent: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10. So, that's r^10.Putting it all together, the product is (a₁)^5 * r^10. And the problem says this product equals 32. So:(a₁)^5 * r^10 = 32Hmm, okay. I need to find a₃, which is a₁*r². Maybe I can express a₃ in terms of the product. Let me think.Wait, if I can find a₁*r², that's exactly a₃. Maybe I can manipulate the equation (a₁)^5 * r^10 = 32 to get a₁*r².Let me see. Let's write (a₁)^5 * r^10 as (a₁ * r²)^5. Because (a₁ * r²)^5 = a₁^5 * (r²)^5 = a₁^5 * r^10. Yes, that works!So, (a₁ * r²)^5 = 32Which means that a₁ * r² is the fifth root of 32. Let me compute that.32 is 2^5, right? So, the fifth root of 32 is 2. Therefore:a₁ * r² = 2But wait, a₁ * r² is exactly a₃. So, a₃ = 2.Oh, that's neat! So, regardless of the values of a₁ and r, as long as the product of the first five terms is 32, the third term must be 2.Let me just verify that. Suppose a₃ is 2. Then, the terms would be:a₁, a₁*r, 2, 2*r, 2*r²So, the product is a₁ * (a₁*r) * 2 * (2*r) * (2*r²)Let me compute that:First, multiply the constants: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8Then, the a₁ terms: a₁ * a₁ = (a₁)^2The r terms: r * r * r² = r^(1+1+2) = r^4So, overall, the product is 8 * (a₁)^2 * r^4But wait, from earlier, we had (a₁)^5 * r^10 = 32. Hmm, but here, it's 8*(a₁)^2*r^4. So, maybe I made a mistake in the way I broke it down.Wait, no, actually, let's see. If a₃ = 2, then a₁ = a₃ / r² = 2 / r².So, let me substitute a₁ = 2 / r² into the product:Product = (2 / r²) * (2 / r² * r) * 2 * (2 * r) * (2 * r²)Simplify each term:First term: 2 / r²Second term: (2 / r²) * r = 2 / rThird term: 2Fourth term: 2 * rFifth term: 2 * r²Now, multiply all together:(2 / r²) * (2 / r) * 2 * (2 r) * (2 r²)Multiply constants: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32Multiply r terms: (1 / r²) * (1 / r) * 1 * r * r²Let me compute the exponents:1 / r² is r^(-2)1 / r is r^(-1)1 is r^0r is r^1r² is r^2So, adding exponents: (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 = 0So, the r terms multiply to r^0 = 1Therefore, the product is 32 * 1 = 32, which matches the given condition.So, yes, that checks out. Therefore, a₃ is indeed 2.I think that's solid. So, the key was recognizing that the product of the first five terms can be expressed as (a₃)^5, because each term is a multiple of a₃ with powers of r that cancel out when multiplied. So, that simplifies the problem a lot.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that in a geometric sequence, the terms are symmetric around the middle term when considering products. Since there are five terms, the third term is the geometric mean of the five terms. So, the product of the five terms is (a₃)^5, which equals 32. Therefore, a₃ is the fifth root of 32, which is 2.Yeah, that makes sense. So, whether I approach it by expressing each term in terms of a₁ and r, or by recognizing the symmetry in the geometric sequence, I end up with the same conclusion: a₃ is 2.**Final Answer**The third term is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Tim buys a book of esoteric words.  He learns 10 words from it a day.  In 2 years the book has increased the number of words he knows by 50%.

Since he learns 10 words each day, the total number of words learned is 10 words/day multiplied by the number of days in two years.Next, calculate the number of days in two years. Assuming there are 365 days in a year, two years would have 730 days.Multiply the daily learning rate by the total number of days: 10 words/day * 730 days = 7,300 words.Let the original number of words Tim knew be ( W ). The book increased his vocabulary by 50%, so the total number of words he knows after two years is ( W + 0.5W = 1.5W ).Set up the equation: ( 1.5W = 7,300 ).Solve for ( W ) by dividing both sides by 1.5: ( W = frac{7,300}{1.5} = 4,866.overline{6} ).Since the number of words should be a whole number, round to the nearest whole number: ( W = 4,867 ) words."},{"question":"The denominator of a fraction is less than the square of its numerator by 1.

Find this fraction.","answer":"Okay, so I have this fraction problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.\\"The denominator of a fraction is less than the square of its numerator by 1.\\" Hmm, okay. So if I let the numerator be some number, say, x, then the denominator would be x squared minus 1. So, denominator = x² - 1. Got that.\\" If 2 is added to both the numerator and the denominator, the value of the fraction will be greater than 1/4.\\" Alright, so if I take the original fraction, which is x over (x² - 1), and add 2 to both the numerator and the denominator, the new fraction becomes (x + 2)/(x² - 1 + 2) = (x + 2)/(x² + 1). And this new fraction is greater than 1/4. So, (x + 2)/(x² + 1) > 1/4. I'll need to solve this inequality.\\" If 3 is subtracted from both the numerator and the denominator of the original fraction, the value of the fraction will be equal to 1/12.\\" So, subtracting 3 from both numerator and denominator gives (x - 3)/(x² - 1 - 3) = (x - 3)/(x² - 4). And this equals 1/12. So, (x - 3)/(x² - 4) = 1/12. That's an equation I can solve for x.So, the plan is: first, solve the equation (x - 3)/(x² - 4) = 1/12 to find possible values of x. Then, check which of those values satisfy the inequality (x + 2)/(x² + 1) > 1/4.Let me start with the equation.Equation: (x - 3)/(x² - 4) = 1/12First, I can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:12(x - 3) = x² - 4Let me expand the left side:12x - 36 = x² - 4Now, bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:x² - 4 - 12x + 36 = 0Simplify:x² - 12x + 32 = 0Wait, let me check that again:12x - 36 = x² - 4So, subtract 12x and add 36 to both sides:0 = x² - 12x + 32Yes, that's correct. So, quadratic equation is x² - 12x + 32 = 0.Let me try to factor this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 32 and add up to -12. Hmm, 32 can be factored as 8 and 4, 16 and 2, 32 and 1. Let's see, 8 and 4: 8 + 4 = 12. So, if both are negative, they would add to -12 and multiply to 32. So, the factors are (x - 8)(x - 4) = 0.So, solutions are x = 8 and x = 4.Wait, let me check that:(x - 8)(x - 4) = x² - 4x - 8x + 32 = x² - 12x + 32. Yes, that's correct.So, x can be 8 or 4.Now, I need to check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they don't make the denominator zero.Original equation: (x - 3)/(x² - 4) = 1/12For x = 8: denominator is 8² - 4 = 64 - 4 = 60, which is not zero. So, that's fine.For x = 4: denominator is 4² - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12, which is also not zero. So, both solutions are valid.Now, moving on to the inequality: (x + 2)/(x² + 1) > 1/4We have two possible x values: 8 and 4. Let's plug them in and see which one satisfies the inequality.First, x = 8:(8 + 2)/(8² + 1) = 10/65 ≈ 0.15381/4 is 0.25. So, 0.1538 is less than 0.25. So, 10/65 is not greater than 1/4. Therefore, x = 8 does not satisfy the inequality.Now, x = 4:(4 + 2)/(4² + 1) = 6/17 ≈ 0.35290.3529 is greater than 0.25, so 6/17 > 1/4. Therefore, x = 4 satisfies the inequality.So, x = 4 is the solution.Therefore, the original fraction is x/(x² - 1) = 4/(16 - 1) = 4/15.Wait, let me double-check that.Denominator is x² - 1, so 4² - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15. So, yes, the fraction is 4/15.Let me verify the conditions with this fraction.First condition: denominator is less than the square of numerator by 1.Numerator squared is 16, denominator is 15. 16 - 1 = 15, so that's correct.Second condition: adding 2 to both numerator and denominator.Numerator becomes 6, denominator becomes 17. 6/17 ≈ 0.3529, which is greater than 1/4 (0.25). Correct.Third condition: subtracting 3 from both numerator and denominator.Numerator becomes 1, denominator becomes 12. 1/12 ≈ 0.0833, which is equal to 1/12. Correct.So, all conditions are satisfied.Therefore, the fraction is 4/15.**Final Answer**The fraction is boxed{dfrac{4}{15}}."},{"question":"An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between each number and the previous one is constant; this difference is called the common difference. (For example, 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32 is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.)Bolek and Lolek each had their own arithmetic sequence. Both Bolek's and Lolek's sequences started with the number 2023 and ended with the number 3023. These two sequences had 26 common numbers. The ratio of Bolek's to Lolek's common difference was 5: 2.Determine the difference between Bolek's and Lolek's common difference.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two arithmetic sequences, one belonging to Bolek and the other to Lolek. Both sequences start at 2023 and end at 3023. They have 26 common numbers, and the ratio of their common differences is 5:2. I need to find the difference between Bolek's and Lolek's common differences.First, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if Bolek's sequence has a common difference of, say, d1, and Lolek's has d2, then their sequences look like:Bolek: 2023, 2023 + d1, 2023 + 2d1, ..., 3023Lolek: 2023, 2023 + d2, 2023 + 2d2, ..., 3023Given that the ratio of d1 to d2 is 5:2, so d1/d2 = 5/2. That means d1 = (5/2)d2.Now, both sequences start and end at the same numbers, so they must have the same number of terms? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because the common difference affects how many terms there are.Wait, actually, the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence can be found by the formula:Number of terms, n = [(Last term - First term)/common difference] + 1So for Bolek, n1 = [(3023 - 2023)/d1] + 1Similarly, for Lolek, n2 = [(3023 - 2023)/d2] + 1Calculating the difference between the last and first term: 3023 - 2023 = 1000.So, n1 = (1000/d1) + 1n2 = (1000/d2) + 1But since d1 = (5/2)d2, let's substitute that into n1:n1 = (1000 / (5/2 d2)) + 1 = (1000 * 2 / 5 d2) + 1 = (400 / d2) + 1So, n1 = 400/d2 + 1 and n2 = 1000/d2 + 1Hmm, okay. Now, the problem says that there are 26 common numbers between the two sequences. So, the intersection of Bolek's and Lolek's sequences has 26 terms.I think this means that the two sequences overlap at 26 points. So, the common terms form another arithmetic sequence, with a common difference equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of d1 and d2. Is that right?Wait, let me think. If two arithmetic sequences have a common difference d1 and d2, then their common terms will form another arithmetic sequence with a common difference equal to the LCM of d1 and d2.Yes, that sounds familiar. So, the common terms will have a common difference of LCM(d1, d2). So, the number of common terms can be found by:Number of common terms = [(Last common term - First common term)/LCM(d1, d2)] + 1In this case, the first common term is 2023, and the last common term is 3023.So, the number of common terms is [(3023 - 2023)/LCM(d1, d2)] + 1 = (1000 / LCM(d1, d2)) + 1And we know this equals 26.So, (1000 / LCM(d1, d2)) + 1 = 26Subtracting 1 from both sides: 1000 / LCM(d1, d2) = 25Therefore, LCM(d1, d2) = 1000 / 25 = 40So, LCM(d1, d2) = 40But we know that d1 = (5/2)d2, so let me denote d2 as 2k, so that d1 = 5k, where k is some positive integer. Because d1 and d2 must be integers, right? Because the terms of the arithmetic sequences are integers, so the common differences must be integers as well.Wait, the problem doesn't specify that the common differences are integers, but the terms are numbers, which are integers. So, the common differences could be fractions, but in this case, since the ratio is 5:2, which are integers, it's likely that d1 and d2 are integers as well.So, let me assume that d1 and d2 are integers. So, d1 = 5k and d2 = 2k, where k is a positive integer.Then, LCM(d1, d2) = LCM(5k, 2k). Since 5 and 2 are coprime, LCM(5k, 2k) = 10k.But earlier, we found that LCM(d1, d2) = 40.So, 10k = 40 => k = 4Therefore, d1 = 5k = 20, and d2 = 2k = 8So, the common differences are 20 and 8.Therefore, the difference between Bolek's and Lolek's common difference is 20 - 8 = 12.Wait, but let me verify this.So, if d1 = 20 and d2 = 8, then LCM(20, 8) is 40, which is correct.So, the number of common terms is (1000 / 40) + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26, which matches the problem statement.Also, let's check the number of terms in each sequence.For Bolek: n1 = (1000 / 20) + 1 = 50 + 1 = 51 termsFor Lolek: n2 = (1000 / 8) + 1 = 125 + 1 = 126 termsSo, Bolek's sequence has 51 terms, Lolek's has 126 terms.Now, the common terms should be every 40 steps, starting at 2023.So, the common terms are 2023, 2023 + 40, 2023 + 80, ..., 3023.Number of terms: (3023 - 2023)/40 + 1 = 1000/40 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26, which is correct.So, that seems consistent.Therefore, the difference between Bolek's and Lolek's common difference is 20 - 8 = 12.But wait, the problem says \\"the difference between Bolek's and Lolek's common difference\\". So, depending on who has the larger difference, it's 20 - 8 = 12.Alternatively, if we consider absolute difference, it's still 12.So, I think 12 is the answer.But just to make sure, let me recap.Given both sequences start at 2023 and end at 3023, with a ratio of common differences 5:2.We let d1 = 5k, d2 = 2k.Then, LCM(d1, d2) = LCM(5k, 2k) = 10k.Number of common terms is 26, so (1000 / LCM(d1, d2)) + 1 = 26 => LCM(d1, d2) = 40.Thus, 10k = 40 => k = 4.Therefore, d1 = 20, d2 = 8, difference is 12.Yes, that seems solid.**Final Answer**The difference between Bolek's and Lolek's common difference is boxed{12}."},{"question":"Given a complex number z=1+3i, find zcdot overline{z}=____.","answer":"To find the product of the complex number ( z = 1 + 3i ) and its conjugate ( overline{z} = 1 - 3i ), I start by writing out the multiplication.First, I multiply the real parts: ( 1 times 1 = 1 ).Next, I multiply the outer terms: ( 1 times (-3i) = -3i ).Then, I multiply the inner terms: ( 3i times 1 = 3i ).Finally, I multiply the imaginary parts: ( 3i times (-3i) = -9i^2 ).Adding all these terms together, I get ( 1 - 3i + 3i - 9i^2 ).Since ( i^2 = -1 ), the term ( -9i^2 ) becomes ( 9 ).Combining like terms, the imaginary parts cancel out, leaving ( 1 + 9 = 10 ).Therefore, the product ( z cdot overline{z} ) is ( 10 )."},{"question":"Calculate:<br/>(1)(-8)-(-6)+(-3);<br/>(2)frac{5}{13}-(+3.7)+(+frac{8}{13})-(-1.7).","answer":"First, I'll tackle the first expression: (1)(-8) - (-6) + (-3).

So, all three of these fractions are equal to each other. Let me denote this common value as some constant, say, ( c ). That way, I can write each fraction equal to ( c ):[frac{7}{x + y} = c, quad frac{k}{x + z} = c, quad frac{11}{z - y} = c.]So, from each of these, I can express ( x + y ), ( x + z ), and ( z - y ) in terms of ( c ):1. From the first equation: ( x + y = frac{7}{c} ).2. From the second equation: ( x + z = frac{k}{c} ).3. From the third equation: ( z - y = frac{11}{c} ).Now, I have three equations:1. ( x + y = frac{7}{c} )  --- (1)2. ( x + z = frac{k}{c} )  --- (2)3. ( z - y = frac{11}{c} )  --- (3)I need to find ( k ), so maybe I can express ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) in terms of ( c ) and then find a relationship between them.Let me see if I can solve for ( y ) and ( z ) in terms of ( x ) or something. Let's try subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):Equation (2) minus equation (1):( (x + z) - (x + y) = frac{k}{c} - frac{7}{c} )Simplify:( z - y = frac{k - 7}{c} )But from equation (3), ( z - y = frac{11}{c} ). So,( frac{k - 7}{c} = frac{11}{c} )Since ( c ) is not zero (because we can't divide by zero in the original fractions), we can multiply both sides by ( c ):( k - 7 = 11 )So, solving for ( k ):( k = 11 + 7 = 18 )Wait, so is it that straightforward? Let me check my steps again.1. I set all fractions equal to ( c ).2. Expressed each denominator in terms of ( c ).3. Subtracted equation (1) from equation (2) to get ( z - y ).4. Noted that ( z - y ) is also equal to ( frac{11}{c} ) from equation (3).5. Equated the two expressions for ( z - y ) and solved for ( k ).Seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach it another way.Alternatively, since all three fractions are equal, I can set up proportions:( frac{7}{x + y} = frac{11}{z - y} )Cross-multiplying:( 7(z - y) = 11(x + y) )Similarly, ( frac{7}{x + y} = frac{k}{x + z} )Cross-multiplying:( 7(x + z) = k(x + y) )So, now I have two equations:1. ( 7(z - y) = 11(x + y) ) --- (A)2. ( 7(x + z) = k(x + y) ) --- (B)From equation (A):( 7z - 7y = 11x + 11y )Bring all terms to one side:( 7z - 7y - 11x - 11y = 0 )Simplify:( -11x - 18y + 7z = 0 ) --- (A1)From equation (B):( 7x + 7z = kx + ky )Bring all terms to one side:( 7x + 7z - kx - ky = 0 )Factor:( (7 - k)x + (-k)y + 7z = 0 ) --- (B1)Now, I have two equations (A1) and (B1):(A1): ( -11x - 18y + 7z = 0 )(B1): ( (7 - k)x - ky + 7z = 0 )Hmm, so I have two equations with three variables. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of others.Alternatively, since both equations equal zero, I can set their coefficients proportional or something.Wait, maybe I can subtract (A1) from (B1) or something.But let's see:Let me write both equations:1. ( -11x - 18y + 7z = 0 )2. ( (7 - k)x - ky + 7z = 0 )Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:( [ (7 - k)x - ky + 7z ] - [ -11x - 18y + 7z ] = 0 - 0 )Simplify:( (7 - k)x - ky + 7z + 11x + 18y - 7z = 0 )Combine like terms:( (7 - k + 11)x + (-k + 18)y + (7z - 7z) = 0 )Simplify:( (18 - k)x + (18 - k)y = 0 )Factor:( (18 - k)(x + y) = 0 )So, either ( 18 - k = 0 ) or ( x + y = 0 ).But ( x + y ) is in the denominator of the first fraction, so ( x + y ) cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, ( 18 - k ) must be zero.Thus, ( 18 - k = 0 implies k = 18 ).Okay, so that confirms my earlier result. So, ( k = 18 ).Just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach it.Alternatively, maybe express ( x + y ), ( x + z ), and ( z - y ) in terms of ( c ) as I did initially, and then solve for ( x ), ( y ), ( z ).From equation (1): ( x + y = frac{7}{c} )From equation (3): ( z - y = frac{11}{c} )Let me add equations (1) and (3):( (x + y) + (z - y) = frac{7}{c} + frac{11}{c} )Simplify:( x + z = frac{18}{c} )But from equation (2): ( x + z = frac{k}{c} )Therefore, ( frac{k}{c} = frac{18}{c} implies k = 18 ).Yep, same answer. So, I think that's solid.Just to recap:1. Set all equal to a constant ( c ).2. Expressed each denominator in terms of ( c ).3. Either subtract equations or add them to eliminate variables.4.

How many different arrangements are there in the following situations?  (1) A and B must stand together;  (2) A is not at the head of the line, and B is not at the end of the line;  (3) There must be exactly one person between A and B.","answer":"Okay, so I've got these three permutation problems to solve, and I need to figure out how to approach each one. Let me take them one at a time.Starting with the first problem: There are 7 students standing in a row. How many different arrangements are there if A and B must stand together?Hmm, okay. So, when two people must stand together, I think we can treat them as a single unit or \\"block.\\" That way, instead of having 7 individual students, we have 6 units to arrange: the AB block and the other 5 students. But wait, A and B can be in two different orders within that block: AB or BA. So, for each arrangement of the 6 units, there are 2 possible arrangements of A and B. So, the total number of arrangements should be the number of ways to arrange the 6 units multiplied by 2. Calculating that, the number of ways to arrange 6 units is 6 factorial, which is 6! = 720. Then, multiplying by 2 gives 720 * 2 = 1440.Let me just double-check that. If we consider A and B as a single entity, we're effectively reducing the problem to arranging 6 items, which is 6!. Since A and B can switch places, we multiply by 2. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the answer for the first part is 1440.Moving on to the second problem: A is not at the head of the line, and B is not at the end of the line.Alright, this seems a bit trickier. So, we need to count all the permutations of 7 students where A is not first and B is not last.I think the way to approach this is by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions, then subtract the arrangements where A is at the head, subtract the arrangements where B is at the end, and then add back the arrangements where both A is at the head and B is at the end because we subtracted them twice.So, total arrangements without restrictions: 7! = 5040.Number of arrangements where A is at the head: If A is fixed at the first position, the remaining 6 students can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways.Number of arrangements where B is at the end: Similarly, if B is fixed at the last position, the remaining 6 students can be arranged in 6! = 720 ways.Now, the number of arrangements where both A is at the head and B is at the end: If both positions are fixed, then the remaining 5 students can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.So, applying inclusion-exclusion: Total = 5040 - 720 - 720 + 120.Let me compute that step by step:5040 - 720 = 43204320 - 720 = 36003600 + 120 = 3720.So, the total number of arrangements where A is not at the head and B is not at the end is 3720.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, total arrangements: 5040. Subtract the ones where A is first (720) and the ones where B is last (720). But when we subtract both, we subtracted the case where both A is first and B is last twice, so we need to add it back once. That case is 120. So, 5040 - 720 - 720 + 120 = 5040 - 1440 + 120 = 5040 - 1320 = 3720. Yeah, that seems correct.So, the answer for the second part is 3720.Now, the third problem: There must be exactly one person between A and B.Hmm, okay. So, A and B must be separated by exactly one person. That means the distance between them is two positions apart.So, in a row of 7 students, how many possible positions are there for A and B such that there's exactly one person between them?Let me visualize the row: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.If A is in position 1, then B must be in position 3.If A is in position 2, B can be in position 4.If A is in position 3, B can be in position 5.If A is in position 4, B can be in position 6.If A is in position 5, B can be in position 7.Similarly, if A is in position 3, B can be in position 1.Wait, no, hold on. If A is in position 3, B can be in position 1 or 5? Wait, no, exactly one person between them. So, if A is in position 3, B can be in position 1 or 5? Wait, no, if A is in position 3, then B must be either in position 1 (with two positions apart) or position 5 (with one person in between). Wait, no, exactly one person between them. So, if A is in position 3, the positions for B are 1 and 5? Wait, no, position 1 is two positions away, which would mean two people in between, right? Wait, no, positions 1 and 3 have one person in between (position 2). Similarly, positions 3 and 5 have one person in between (position 4). So, yeah, A in 1, B in 3; A in 2, B in 4; A in 3, B in 5; A in 4, B in 6; A in 5, B in 7. Similarly, A can be in position 3, B in position 1; A in position 4, B in position 2; A in position 5, B in position 3; A in position 6, B in position 4; A in position 7, B in position 5.Wait, so actually, for each possible starting position of A, B can be either to the left or the right, as long as there's exactly one person between them.So, let's count how many such pairs there are.Starting with A in position 1: B can only be in position 3.A in position 2: B can be in position 4.A in position 3: B can be in position 1 or 5.A in position 4: B can be in position 2 or 6.A in position 5: B can be in position 3 or 7.A in position 6: B can be in position 4.A in position 7: B can be in position 5.So, let's count the number of possible (A, B) pairs:- A in 1: 1- A in 2: 1- A in 3: 2- A in 4: 2- A in 5: 2- A in 6: 1- A in 7: 1Total pairs: 1+1+2+2+2+1+1 = 10.But wait, each pair is counted twice because for each pair (A, B), we can have A first or B first. Wait, no, actually, in the above count, each pair is unique. For example, A in 1 and B in 3 is one arrangement, and A in 3 and B in 1 is another. So, actually, each of these 10 positions is a unique arrangement where A and B are separated by exactly one person.Wait, no, hold on. When I count A in 1, B in 3, that's one specific arrangement. Similarly, A in 3, B in 1 is another arrangement. So, actually, the number of such pairs is 10, but each pair can be arranged in two ways: AB or BA.Wait, no, in the above count, each of the 10 is a specific position for A and B, but in each case, A and B can switch places. So, for each of these 10, we have two possibilities: A is on the left and B is on the right, or vice versa.Wait, no, actually, in the way I counted above, each of the 10 is a unique pair where A is in a specific position and B is in another. So, for example, A in 1 and B in 3 is one arrangement, and A in 3 and B in 1 is another. So, actually, the total number of such arrangements is 10 * 2 = 20? Wait, no, no, wait.Wait, no, in the initial count, I considered A in each position and where B can be. So, for each position of A, I counted the possible positions of B. So, for example, when A is in 1, B can only be in 3, so that's one arrangement. When A is in 3, B can be in 1 or 5, so that's two arrangements. So, in total, 10 arrangements where A and B are separated by exactly one person.But wait, each of these arrangements is unique in terms of their positions. So, for each of these 10, the rest of the students can be arranged in the remaining 5 positions. So, for each of these 10, the number of arrangements is 5!.Wait, so total arrangements would be 10 * 5!.Let me compute that: 10 * 120 = 1200.But hold on, wait a second. Is that correct? Because when I fix A and B in specific positions, the rest can be arranged freely. So, yes, for each of the 10 possible (A, B) positions, the remaining 5 students can be arranged in 5! ways. So, 10 * 120 = 1200.But let me double-check the number of (A, B) positions. So, in a row of 7, how many ways can A and B be placed with exactly one person between them?Another way to think about it is: the number of ways to choose two positions for A and B such that they are two apart.In a row of n positions, the number of ways to choose two positions with exactly k positions between them is (n - k - 1) * 2, because for each starting position, you can have A on the left or right.Wait, in this case, k = 1 (exactly one person between them), so the number of such pairs is (7 - 1 - 1) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10. So, that matches my earlier count.So, 10 possible (A, B) pairs, each with two possible orders (AB or BA), but wait, in my initial count, I considered A in each position and where B can be, which already accounts for both AB and BA. So, actually, the 10 includes both AB and BA.Wait, no, hold on. If I fix A in position 1, B is in position 3. That's AB. If I fix A in position 3, B can be in position 1 or 5. So, that's BA or AB. So, actually, the 10 includes both AB and BA.Wait, but actually, when I counted 10, I was counting the number of ordered pairs where A is in a specific position and B is in another. So, for each unordered pair of positions, there are two ordered pairs (AB and BA). So, if I have 10 ordered pairs, that corresponds to 5 unordered pairs.Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.If I think of the positions, the number of ways to choose two positions with exactly one person between them is 6. Because in a row of 7, the possible starting positions for A such that there is space for B with one person in between are positions 1 through 5. So, starting at 1, B is at 3; starting at 2, B at 4; starting at 3, B at 5; starting at 4, B at 6; starting at 5, B at 7. So, that's 5 possible starting positions for A, each giving a unique pair. But since A and B can switch places, each of these 5 can be arranged in two ways, so 5 * 2 = 10 ordered pairs.So, yes, 10 ordered pairs where A and B are separated by exactly one person.Therefore, for each of these 10 ordered pairs, the remaining 5 students can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways. So, total arrangements: 10 * 120 = 1200.Wait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, we can consider the number of ways to choose positions for A and B, then arrange the rest.Number of ways to choose positions for A and B with exactly one person between them: as above, 10.For each such choice, A and B can be arranged in 2 ways (AB or BA). Wait, no, actually, the positions are fixed once we choose where A and B are. Wait, no, if we fix A in position 1, B is in position 3. That's one arrangement. If we fix B in position 1, A is in position 3. That's another arrangement. So, each pair of positions can be assigned to A and B in 2 ways.Wait, so actually, the number of ways to place A and B with exactly one person between them is 10 (as above), but each of these 10 includes both AB and BA. So, actually, the number of ways is 10, and for each, the rest can be arranged in 5!.So, 10 * 120 = 1200.Alternatively, another approach: treat A and B as a block with one person in between. So, the block would occupy 3 positions: A, someone, B or B, someone, A.But wait, in this case, the block is of size 3, but the middle person is someone else. So, how many such blocks can we have?In a row of 7, the number of ways to place a block of 3 with A and B at the ends and someone in the middle is: for each possible starting position of the block.The block can start at position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, 5 possible starting positions.For each starting position, the block can be AB or BA.So, 5 * 2 = 10 ways to place the block.Then, the middle person can be any of the remaining 5 students.Wait, no, actually, the middle person is just one person, but the rest of the 4 students can be arranged in the remaining 4 positions.Wait, so total arrangements would be: number of blocks (10) multiplied by the number of ways to choose the middle person and arrange the rest.Wait, no, actually, the middle person is just one person, but the rest of the 5 students (excluding A and B) can be arranged in the remaining 5 positions.Wait, no, hold on. If we fix A and B with one person between them, we have:- Choose the positions for A and B: 10 ways as above.- Choose the person to be between A and B: 5 choices (since there are 5 other students).- Arrange the remaining 4 students in the remaining 4 positions: 4! = 24 ways.So, total arrangements: 10 * 5 * 24.Calculating that: 10 * 5 = 50; 50 * 24 = 1200.So, same result as before.Therefore, the answer is 1200.Wait, but hold on, in my initial approach, I considered the number of ordered pairs (A, B) as 10, and then multiplied by 5! for the rest. But in this second approach, I broke it down into choosing the middle person and arranging the rest, which also gave me 1200.So, both approaches lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.Therefore, the answer for the third part is 1200.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1) A and B must stand together: Treat them as a block, so 6 units, 6! arrangements, multiplied by 2 for AB and BA: 1440.2) A not at head, B not at end: Total arrangements minus arrangements where A is first, minus arrangements where B is last, plus arrangements where both A is first and B is last: 5040 - 720 - 720 + 120 = 3720.3) Exactly one person between A and B: 10 possible ordered pairs of positions for A and B, each allowing 5! arrangements for the rest: 10 * 120 = 1200.Yes, that all seems consistent.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{1440}(2) boxed{3720}(3) boxed{1200}"},{"question":"During the 2014 APEC Leaders' Meeting, a group of college student volunteers affectionately nicknamed \\"The Smurfs\\" was involved in the service.

The person accumulates the score with each coin flip. They notice that regardless of the number of flips, there are exactly 35 scores that cannot be recorded. For example, 58 is one such score. Determine the values of a and b. (32nd Annual Putnam Mathematical Competition, 1971)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where someone is flipping a coin, and for each heads, they get 'a' points, and for each tails, they get 'b' points. Both 'a' and 'b' are positive integers, and importantly, 'a' is greater than 'b'. The key point is that no matter how many flips they do, there are exactly 35 scores that cannot be recorded. An example given is 58, which is one such score. I need to figure out what 'a' and 'b' are.Hmm, okay. So first, this seems related to something called the \\"Frobenius number,\\" which I remember is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of two coprime integers. The formula for the Frobenius number when you have two numbers is (a*b - a - b). But wait, in this case, the number of non-attainable scores is given as 35, not just the Frobenius number. So maybe I need to recall how the number of non-representable numbers relates to the Frobenius number.I think the number of non-representable numbers when you have two coprime integers 'a' and 'b' is given by (a-1)(b-1)/2. Is that right? Let me check. If that's the case, then (a-1)(b-1)/2 = 35. So, (a-1)(b-1) = 70. Hmm, okay, so I need two integers (a-1) and (b-1) such that their product is 70. Also, since 'a' and 'b' are positive integers with 'a' > 'b', then (a-1) and (b-1) are also positive integers, and (a-1) > (b-1).So, let's factor 70 into two positive integers where the first is greater than the second. The factors of 70 are:1 and 702 and 355 and 147 and 10So, these are the possible pairs for (a-1, b-1). Therefore, the possible pairs for (a, b) would be:(2, 71), (3, 36), (6, 15), (8, 11)But wait, hold on. I think the formula (a-1)(b-1)/2 is only valid when 'a' and 'b' are coprime. So, I need to make sure that in each of these pairs, 'a' and 'b' are coprime.Let me check each pair:1. (2, 71): 2 and 71 are coprime, since 71 is prime.2. (3, 36): 3 and 36 share a common factor of 3, so they are not coprime.3. (6, 15): 6 and 15 share a common factor of 3, so not coprime.4. (8, 11): 8 and 11 are coprime, since 11 is prime and doesn't divide 8.So, only the pairs (2,71) and (8,11) are coprime. Therefore, these are the only candidates.But wait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that 58 is one of the scores that cannot be recorded. So, 58 is not attainable. Let's check for each pair whether 58 is non-attainable.First, let's check (a, b) = (2,71). Since 2 and 71 are coprime, the largest non-attainable number is 2*71 - 2 -71 = 142 - 73 = 69. So, all numbers greater than 69 can be expressed as combinations of 2 and 71. But 58 is less than 69, so it could be either attainable or not. Let's see if 58 can be written as 2x + 71y where x and y are non-negative integers.Since 71 is much larger than 58, y can only be 0. So, 58 = 2x. That would mean x = 29. So, 58 is attainable by 29 heads and 0 tails. But the problem says 58 is not attainable. Therefore, (2,71) cannot be the correct pair.Now, let's check the other pair, (8,11). Are 8 and 11 coprime? Yes, since 11 is prime and doesn't divide 8. The Frobenius number is 8*11 - 8 -11 = 88 - 19 = 69. So, the largest non-attainable number is 69, and all numbers above 69 can be expressed as combinations of 8 and 11.But 58 is less than 69, so we need to check if 58 can be expressed as 8x + 11y. Let's try to find non-negative integers x and y such that 8x + 11y = 58.Let me try different values of y:Start with y=0: 8x = 58 => x = 58/8 = 7.25, which is not an integer.y=1: 8x + 11 = 58 => 8x = 47 => x = 47/8 = 5.875, not integer.y=2: 8x + 22 = 58 => 8x = 36 => x = 4.5, not integer.y=3: 8x + 33 = 58 => 8x = 25 => x = 25/8 = 3.125, not integer.y=4: 8x + 44 = 58 => 8x = 14 => x = 14/8 = 1.75, not integer.y=5: 8x + 55 = 58 => 8x = 3 => x = 3/8, not integer.y=6: 8x + 66 = 58 => 8x = -8, which is negative. So, no solution.Therefore, 58 cannot be expressed as a combination of 8 and 11. So, 58 is indeed a non-attainable score for (8,11). Therefore, this pair satisfies the condition.But just to be thorough, let's make sure that the number of non-attainable scores is exactly 35. As per the formula, (a-1)(b-1)/2 = (8-1)(11-1)/2 = 7*10/2 = 35. Perfect, that's exactly what the problem states.So, the values of 'a' and 'b' are 8 and 11. But wait, the problem says a > b, so a is 11 and b is 8? Wait, hold on, no. Wait, in the pair (8,11), is a=8 and b=11? But the problem says a > b. So, if a=11 and b=8, that would make sense because 11 > 8. But in the pair (a-1, b-1) = (7,10), so a=8, b=11? Wait, no, hold on, maybe I got confused.Wait, no. Let me clarify. Earlier, I had (a-1)(b-1) = 70, so the pairs for (a-1, b-1) are (70,1), (35,2), (14,5), (10,7). Then, adding 1 to each, we get (71,2), (36,3), (15,6), (11,8). So, the pairs (a,b) are (71,2), (36,3), (15,6), (11,8). But since a > b, then (71,2), (36,3), (15,6), (11,8). So, 71>2, 36>3, 15>6, 11>8. So, in the case of (11,8), a=11, b=8. So, in the problem, the person scores a points for heads and b points for tails, with a > b. So, a=11, b=8.But earlier, when I was considering (a, b) as (8,11), I think I made a mistake in assigning a and b. Because in the pair (a-1, b-1) = (7,10), which would make a=8 and b=11, but since a > b, that would require 8 > 11, which is not true. So, actually, the correct assignment is (a-1, b-1) = (10,7), so a=11, b=8. Therefore, a=11, b=8.So, that's consistent with the problem statement because a=11 > b=8.Therefore, the values are a=11 and b=8.Wait, let me just double-check. If a=11 and b=8, then the number of non-attainable scores is (11-1)(8-1)/2 = 10*7/2 = 35, which is correct. And 58 is one of them, as we saw earlier. So, that seems to fit.Therefore, the answer should be a=11 and b=8.**Final Answer**The values of (a) and (b) are (boxed{11}) and (boxed{8}) respectively.**Final Answer**The values of (a) and (b) are (boxed{11}) and (boxed{8})."},{"question":"Teams A and B each have 7 players who compete according to a predetermined sequence in a Go relay match. Both teams start with their first player competing against each other, the loser gets eliminated, and the winner competes against the second player of the losing team, and so on, until one team's players are all eliminated. The remaining team wins. How many possible match sequences are there?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a Go relay match between two teams, A and B, each with 7 players. The match proceeds with each team starting their first player, and the loser gets eliminated. The winner then competes against the next player of the losing team, and this continues until one team has all their players eliminated. The question is asking for the number of possible match sequences. Hmm, that sounds a bit like a tournament bracket problem, but with a specific structure.Let me try to break it down. Each match is between two players, one from each team. The loser is eliminated, and the winner stays on to face the next player from the opposing team. So, essentially, it's a sequence of matches where each match is determined by who won the previous one. The process continues until one team has all their players eliminated, meaning the other team has won all their matches.So, if I think about it, the match can end in different numbers of games. The minimum number of games is 7, which would happen if one team wins all their first 7 games. The maximum number of games is 13, which would happen if each team alternates wins until one team is eliminated. Wait, no, actually, if each team alternates wins, the number of games would be 13 because each team has 7 players, so 7 + 6 = 13? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.Actually, if each team alternates wins, the number of games would be 2*7 -1 =13. Because each time a team loses a player, the other team gets to keep their current player. So, for example, if team A wins the first game, then team B's first player is eliminated, and team A's first player stays to face team B's second player. If team B wins the next game, team A's first player is eliminated, and team B's second player stays to face team A's second player. So, each time a team loses a player, the other team gets to keep their current player. So, the total number of games needed to eliminate all 7 players from one team is 7 + 6 =13. Wait, why 7 +6? Because each elimination after the first requires a win from the opposing team, so 7 eliminations require 6 additional wins. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.Alternatively, think of it as a path in a grid. Each game can be thought of as a step either to the right or upwards, with the constraint that you can't go beyond the boundaries. The number of possible paths from (0,0) to (7,7) without crossing the diagonal is given by the Catalan numbers. Wait, but in this case, the match ends when either team has 7 wins, so it's similar to a best-of-13 series, but with the constraint that the match stops as soon as one team reaches 7 wins.So, the number of possible sequences is the sum over k=7 to 13 of the number of sequences where team A wins on the k-th game, plus the same for team B. But since the problem is symmetric for both teams, we can compute it for one team and double it, then subtract the case where the match ends exactly at 13 games because that would be counted twice.Wait, actually, no. The total number of sequences is the number of ways team A can win the match plus the number of ways team B can win the match. Each of these is equal to the number of sequences where team A gets 7 wins before team B does, and vice versa.So, for team A to win the match, they need to have 7 wins before team B gets 7 wins. Similarly for team B. So, the number of sequences where team A wins is equal to the number of sequences where team A has exactly 7 wins and team B has between 0 and 6 wins. But actually, it's a bit more precise than that because the match stops as soon as one team reaches 7 wins. So, for team A to win on the 7th game, team B must have 0 wins. For team A to win on the 8th game, team B must have 1 win, and so on, up to team A winning on the 13th game, where team B has 6 wins.Similarly, for team B to win, it's the same logic. So, the total number of sequences is the sum from k=7 to 13 of the number of sequences where team A wins on the k-th game plus the sum from k=7 to 13 of the number of sequences where team B wins on the k-th game.But since the problem is symmetric, the number of sequences where team A wins is equal to the number where team B wins, so we can compute one and double it.So, let's focus on team A winning. For team A to win on the k-th game, where k ranges from 7 to 13, team A must have exactly 7 wins, and team B must have exactly k -7 wins. But importantly, in the first k-1 games, team A must have exactly 6 wins and team B must have k -7 wins. Because the k-th game is the one where team A gets their 7th win, which ends the match.Therefore, the number of sequences where team A wins on the k-th game is equal to the number of ways to arrange 6 wins for team A and (k -7) wins for team B in the first k -1 games, multiplied by the probability that team A wins the k-th game. But since we're counting sequences, not probabilities, it's just the number of combinations.So, the number of sequences where team A wins on the k-th game is C(k -1, 6), where C is the combination function. Similarly, for team B, it's C(k -1, 6) as well.Therefore, the total number of sequences where team A wins is the sum from k=7 to 13 of C(k -1, 6). Similarly for team B.So, let's compute that.First, for team A:Sum from k=7 to 13 of C(k -1, 6) = C(6,6) + C(7,6) + C(8,6) + C(9,6) + C(10,6) + C(11,6) + C(12,6)Compute each term:C(6,6) = 1C(7,6) = 7C(8,6) = 28C(9,6) = 84C(10,6) = 210C(11,6) = 462C(12,6) = 924Now, sum these up:1 + 7 = 88 + 28 = 3636 + 84 = 120120 + 210 = 330330 + 462 = 792792 + 924 = 1716So, the total number of sequences where team A wins is 1716. Similarly, for team B, it's also 1716.Therefore, the total number of possible match sequences is 1716 + 1716 = 3432.Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because when k=13, both team A and team B have 6 wins each in the first 12 games, and then team A or B wins the 13th game. So, in that case, the number of sequences where team A wins on the 13th game is C(12,6) = 924, and similarly for team B.But adding them up, 1716 for each, gives 3432. But let me think if that's the correct approach.Alternatively, another way to think about this is that the total number of possible sequences is equal to the number of ways the match can proceed until one team is eliminated. Each game is a binary outcome, either A wins or B wins, but with the constraint that the match stops when either A or B reaches 7 wins.So, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible game lengths from 7 to 13, of the number of sequences where the match ends at that game length.For each game length k (from 7 to 13), the number of sequences where team A wins on the k-th game is C(k-1, 6), as we have to have exactly 6 wins in the first k-1 games, and then the k-th game is a win for A.Similarly, for team B, it's C(k-1, 6). So, for each k, the number of sequences is 2*C(k-1,6). Except when k=13, because in that case, both teams have 6 wins in the first 12 games, and then the 13th game decides the winner. So, in that case, the number of sequences is 2*C(12,6). But wait, in our earlier calculation, we added C(12,6) for both A and B, so it's included in the total.But wait, actually, for k=13, the number of sequences where A wins is C(12,6), and similarly for B, so total for k=13 is 2*C(12,6). But in our initial summation, we already included C(12,6) for A and C(12,6) for B, so the total is 2*C(12,6). So, our initial approach was correct.Therefore, the total number of sequences is 2*(C(6,6) + C(7,6) + C(8,6) + C(9,6) + C(10,6) + C(11,6) + C(12,6)) = 2*1716 = 3432.But wait, let me verify this with another approach.Another way to think about this is that the problem is equivalent to counting the number of ways to arrange a sequence of wins and losses such that one team reaches 7 wins before the other. This is similar to the concept of \\"best-of\\" series in sports, where the first to reach a certain number of wins takes the series.In combinatorics, the number of such sequences is given by the sum of combinations where one team reaches 7 wins before the other. The formula for this is 2 * sum_{k=7}^{13} C(k-1, 6). Which is exactly what we computed earlier.Alternatively, another way to compute this is using the reflection principle or recursive methods, but I think the combination approach is straightforward here.Wait, but let me think about the total number of possible game sequences without any stopping condition. If the match went all the way to 13 games, regardless of who is eliminated earlier, the total number of sequences would be 2^13. But in reality, the match stops once one team reaches 7 wins. So, the total number of sequences is less than 2^13.But our calculation gives 3432, which is much less than 8192 (which is 2^13). So, that seems plausible.Alternatively, another way to compute this is to recognize that the number of sequences where team A wins is equal to the number of ways to arrange 7 A wins and up to 6 B wins, with the constraint that the 7th A win comes last. Similarly for team B.So, for team A, the number of sequences is sum_{k=0}^{6} C(7 + k -1, k) = sum_{k=0}^{6} C(6 + k, k). Wait, that's similar to our earlier approach.Wait, actually, for each possible number of B wins (from 0 to 6), the number of sequences where team A wins with exactly 7 wins and k losses is C(7 + k -1, k) = C(6 + k, k). So, summing from k=0 to k=6, we get sum_{k=0}^{6} C(6 + k, k).Compute that:For k=0: C(6,0)=1k=1: C(7,1)=7k=2: C(8,2)=28k=3: C(9,3)=84k=4: C(10,4)=210k=5: C(11,5)=462k=6: C(12,6)=924Adding these up: 1 + 7 + 28 + 84 + 210 + 462 + 924 = 1716Which is the same as before. So, team A has 1716 sequences, team B also has 1716, so total is 3432.Therefore, the number of possible match sequences is 3432.Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to model this problem? Maybe as a path in a grid where we move right for a win by team A and up for a win by team B. The match ends when we reach either (7, y) or (x,7). So, the number of paths from (0,0) to (7, y) where y <7, plus the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,7) where x <7.But actually, the number of such paths is the same as the number of sequences where team A wins or team B wins, which is what we calculated.Alternatively, the total number of sequences is equal to the number of paths that reach (7, k) for k=0 to 6 plus the number of paths that reach (k,7) for k=0 to 6.Each of these is C(7 + k -1, k) for team A and C(7 + k -1, k) for team B. So, the total is 2 * sum_{k=0}^{6} C(6 + k, k) = 2*1716 = 3432.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about this is using the concept of combinations with repetition. The number of ways team A can win 7 games with team B winning up to 6 games is C(7 +6,6) = C(13,6) = 1716. Similarly for team B. So, total is 2*1716=3432.Wait, that's actually a much quicker way to compute it. Because the number of sequences where team A wins is equal to the number of ways to arrange 7 A wins and up to 6 B wins, which is equivalent to the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 13, which is C(13,6)=1716. Similarly for team B.Therefore, the total number of sequences is 2*C(13,6)=2*1716=3432.Yes, that's a much more straightforward way to compute it. So, the answer is 3432.But let me just verify that with the earlier summation. C(13,6) is 1716, which is the same as the sum from k=0 to 6 of C(6 +k, k). So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, the number of possible match sequences is 3432.**Final Answer**The number of possible match sequences is boxed{3432}."},{"question":"If a is a root of the equation x^{2}+2x-1=0, then the value of 2a^{2}+4a-2024 isA: 2023B: -2023C: 2022D: -2022","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If ( a ) is a root of the equation ( x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 ), then I need to find the value of ( 2a^2 + 4a - 2024 ). The options are A: 2023, B: -2023, C: 2022, D: -2022. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that if ( a ) is a root of the quadratic equation ( x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 ), then it must satisfy the equation. That means when I plug ( a ) into the equation, it should equal zero. So, ( a^2 + 2a - 1 = 0 ). That seems straightforward.Now, the expression I need to evaluate is ( 2a^2 + 4a - 2024 ). Hmm, I notice that ( 2a^2 + 4a ) looks similar to twice the quadratic equation. Let me see: if I take the equation ( a^2 + 2a - 1 = 0 ) and multiply both sides by 2, I get ( 2a^2 + 4a - 2 = 0 ). So, ( 2a^2 + 4a = 2 ).Wait, that's helpful! So, ( 2a^2 + 4a = 2 ). Therefore, substituting back into the expression I need to evaluate, ( 2a^2 + 4a - 2024 ) becomes ( 2 - 2024 ). Let me compute that: ( 2 - 2024 = -2022 ). So, the value should be -2022, which is option D.But hold on, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting again: since ( a ) is a root, ( a^2 + 2a - 1 = 0 ). Therefore, ( a^2 = -2a + 1 ). Maybe I can substitute ( a^2 ) in the expression ( 2a^2 + 4a - 2024 ).Let's try that. If ( a^2 = -2a + 1 ), then ( 2a^2 = 2(-2a + 1) = -4a + 2 ). So, substituting back into ( 2a^2 + 4a - 2024 ), we get ( (-4a + 2) + 4a - 2024 ). Simplifying that: the ( -4a ) and ( +4a ) cancel out, leaving ( 2 - 2024 = -2022 ). Yep, same result.Hmm, so both methods give me -2022. That seems consistent. So, the answer should be D: -2022.Just to make sure, maybe I can solve the quadratic equation and find the actual value of ( a ), then plug it into the expression. Let's see: the equation is ( x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 ). Using the quadratic formula, ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ). Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), ( c = -1 ). So, discriminant is ( 4 + 4 = 8 ). Therefore, roots are ( frac{-2 pm sqrt{8}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 pm sqrt{2} ).So, ( a ) can be ( -1 + sqrt{2} ) or ( -1 - sqrt{2} ). Let me compute ( 2a^2 + 4a - 2024 ) for one of them, say ( a = -1 + sqrt{2} ).First, compute ( a^2 ): ( (-1 + sqrt{2})^2 = 1 - 2sqrt{2} + 2 = 3 - 2sqrt{2} ). Then, ( 2a^2 = 2(3 - 2sqrt{2}) = 6 - 4sqrt{2} ). Next, ( 4a = 4(-1 + sqrt{2}) = -4 + 4sqrt{2} ). So, adding ( 2a^2 + 4a ): ( (6 - 4sqrt{2}) + (-4 + 4sqrt{2}) = 6 - 4 = 2 ). Then, subtract 2024: ( 2 - 2024 = -2022 ). Same result again.Just to be thorough, let me try the other root ( a = -1 - sqrt{2} ). Compute ( a^2 ): ( (-1 - sqrt{2})^2 = 1 + 2sqrt{2} + 2 = 3 + 2sqrt{2} ). Then, ( 2a^2 = 6 + 4sqrt{2} ). ( 4a = 4(-1 - sqrt{2}) = -4 - 4sqrt{2} ). Adding ( 2a^2 + 4a ): ( (6 + 4sqrt{2}) + (-4 - 4sqrt{2}) = 6 - 4 = 2 ). Subtract 2024: ( 2 - 2024 = -2022 ). Yep, same answer.So, all methods lead me to the same conclusion: the value is -2022, which is option D. I think I'm confident with that answer.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Using the digits from 0 to 9, how many unique three-digit numbers can be formed without repeating any digit?","answer":"To determine the number of unique three-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 0 to 9 without repeating any digit, I'll break down the problem step by step.First, I need to consider the hundreds place. Since it's a three-digit number, the hundreds digit cannot be 0. This leaves me with 9 possible choices for the hundreds place (1 through 9).Next, for the tens place, I can use any digit from 0 to 9 except the one already used in the hundreds place. This gives me 9 remaining choices for the tens digit.Finally, for the ones place, I must choose a digit that hasn't been used in either the hundreds or tens place. This results in 8 available choices for the ones digit.By multiplying the number of choices for each place together, I can calculate the total number of unique three-digit numbers that can be formed without repeating any digit."},{"question":"Find the number of solutions in positive integers (left(k; a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k}; b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{k}right)) to the equation[ a_{1}left(b_{1}right) + a_{2}left(b_{1}+b_{2}right) + cdots + a_{k}left(b_{1}+b_{2}+cdots+b_{k}right)= 7.]","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of solutions in positive integers for the equation:[ a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}(b_{1} + b_{2}) + cdots + a_{k}(b_{1} + b_{2} + cdots + b_{k}) = 7.]Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand what this equation is saying. It looks like a sum where each term is a product of an (a_i) and a cumulative sum of (b_j)s up to that point. So, for each (i) from 1 to (k), we have (a_i) multiplied by the sum (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_i), and all these terms add up to 7.Since all (a_i) and (b_j) are positive integers, each term in the sum must be at least 1. So, the entire sum is 7, which is a relatively small number. That suggests that (k) can't be too large because each term contributes at least 1. Let me think about the possible values of (k).If (k = 1), then the equation simplifies to (a_1 b_1 = 7). Since 7 is a prime number, the number of solutions here would be the number of ways to write 7 as a product of two positive integers. That would be 2: (1,7) and (7,1). So, for (k=1), we have 2 solutions.Now, if (k = 2), the equation becomes (a_1 b_1 + a_2(b_1 + b_2) = 7). Let me denote (s_1 = b_1) and (s_2 = b_1 + b_2). Then the equation becomes (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 = 7). But since (s_2 = s_1 + b_2), and (b_2) is a positive integer, (s_2) must be at least (s_1 + 1). So, (s_1) and (s_2) are positive integers with (s_2 > s_1).Let me try to find all possible pairs ((s_1, s_2)) such that (s_2 > s_1) and (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 = 7). Since (a_1) and (a_2) are positive integers, each term (a_1 s_1) and (a_2 s_2) must be at least 1, so the total sum is 7. Let's list all possible values for (s_1) and (s_2):1. (s_1 = 1), then (s_2) can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (since (s_2) must be greater than 1 and (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 = 7)).   - For (s_2 = 2): (a_1 + 2a_2 = 7). The number of positive integer solutions here is the number of (a_2) such that (2a_2 < 7), so (a_2) can be 1, 2, or 3.     - (a_2 = 1): (a_1 = 5)     - (a_2 = 2): (a_1 = 3)     - (a_2 = 3): (a_1 = 1)     So, 3 solutions.   - For (s_2 = 3): (a_1 + 3a_2 = 7). (3a_2 < 7), so (a_2 = 1, 2).     - (a_2 = 1): (a_1 = 4)     - (a_2 = 2): (a_1 = 1)     So, 2 solutions.   - For (s_2 = 4): (a_1 + 4a_2 = 7). (4a_2 < 7), so (a_2 = 1).     - (a_2 = 1): (a_1 = 3)     So, 1 solution.   - For (s_2 = 5): (a_1 + 5a_2 = 7). (5a_2 < 7), so (a_2 = 1).     - (a_2 = 1): (a_1 = 2)     So, 1 solution.   - For (s_2 = 6): (a_1 + 6a_2 = 7). (6a_2 < 7), so (a_2 = 1).     - (a_2 = 1): (a_1 = 1)     So, 1 solution.   Total for (s_1 = 1): 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 solutions.2. (s_1 = 2), then (s_2) can be 3, 4, 5, or 6.   - For (s_2 = 3): (2a_1 + 3a_2 = 7). Let's find positive integers (a_1, a_2).     - (a_2 = 1): (2a_1 = 4) → (a_1 = 2)     - (a_2 = 2): (2a_1 = 1) → Not possible     So, only 1 solution.   - For (s_2 = 4): (2a_1 + 4a_2 = 7). Let's see:     - (4a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - Then (2a_1 = 3), which is not possible.     So, no solutions.   - For (s_2 = 5): (2a_1 + 5a_2 = 7).     - (5a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - (2a_1 = 2) → (a_1 = 1).     So, 1 solution.   - For (s_2 = 6): (2a_1 + 6a_2 = 7).     - (6a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - (2a_1 = 1) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   Total for (s_1 = 2): 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2 solutions.3. (s_1 = 3), then (s_2) can be 4, 5, or 6.   - For (s_2 = 4): (3a_1 + 4a_2 = 7).     - (4a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - (3a_1 = 3) → (a_1 = 1).     So, 1 solution.   - For (s_2 = 5): (3a_1 + 5a_2 = 7).     - (5a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - (3a_1 = 2) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   - For (s_2 = 6): (3a_1 + 6a_2 = 7).     - (6a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - (3a_1 = 1) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   Total for (s_1 = 3): 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 solution.4. (s_1 = 4), then (s_2) can be 5 or 6.   - For (s_2 = 5): (4a_1 + 5a_2 = 7).     - (5a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - (4a_1 = 2) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   - For (s_2 = 6): (4a_1 + 6a_2 = 7).     - (6a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - (4a_1 = 1) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   Total for (s_1 = 4): 0 solutions.5. (s_1 = 5), then (s_2 = 6).   - (5a_1 + 6a_2 = 7).     - (6a_2 < 7) → (a_2 = 1).     - (5a_1 = 1) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.6. (s_1 = 6), then (s_2) would have to be at least 7, but (6a_1 + 7a_2 = 7) is impossible since (6a_1) is at least 6, and (7a_2) is at least 7, summing to at least 13, which is more than 7. So, no solutions.So, for (k=2), the total number of solutions is 8 (from (s_1=1)) + 2 (from (s_1=2)) + 1 (from (s_1=3)) = 11 solutions.Wait, but hold on. Each solution in terms of (s_1) and (s_2) corresponds to a specific (b_1) and (b_2). Since (s_1 = b_1) and (s_2 = b_1 + b_2), then (b_2 = s_2 - s_1). So, for each pair ((s_1, s_2)), we can find (b_1) and (b_2). Therefore, each solution for (a_1, a_2, s_1, s_2) gives a unique solution for (a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2). So, the count of 11 solutions for (k=2) is correct.Now, moving on to (k=3). The equation becomes:[ a_1 b_1 + a_2 (b_1 + b_2) + a_3 (b_1 + b_2 + b_3) = 7.]Let me denote (s_1 = b_1), (s_2 = b_1 + b_2), and (s_3 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3). So, the equation becomes:[ a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3 = 7.]With (s_1 < s_2 < s_3), since each (b_i) is at least 1.Now, since all (a_i) and (s_i) are positive integers, each term (a_1 s_1), (a_2 s_2), (a_3 s_3) is at least 1. So, the sum is 7, meaning each term is at least 1, so the maximum possible (k) is 7, but since (k=3), let's see if it's possible.Let me consider possible values for (s_1, s_2, s_3). Since (s_1 geq 1), (s_2 geq 2), (s_3 geq 3). So, the minimal sum would be (1 + 2 + 3 = 6). Since our total is 7, which is just 1 more than 6, so the only way is to have (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=4), because (1 + 2 + 4 = 7). Wait, but let me check.Wait, no. Because the equation is (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3 = 7). So, the minimal sum is when (a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 1), which would be (s_1 + s_2 + s_3). Since (s_1 geq 1), (s_2 geq 2), (s_3 geq 3), the minimal sum is (1 + 2 + 3 = 6). So, 7 is just 1 more than that. So, we can have either:- (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=4), because (1 + 2 + 4 = 7). But wait, (s_3) must be greater than (s_2), so 4 is okay.Alternatively, maybe (s_1=1), (s_2=3), (s_3=3), but (s_3) must be greater than (s_2), so that's not allowed.Wait, actually, (s_3) must be greater than (s_2), so the only way to get the sum (s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 7) is with (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=4). Because (1 + 2 + 4 = 7). Alternatively, (s_1=1), (s_2=3), (s_3=3) is invalid because (s_3) must be greater than (s_2). Similarly, (s_1=2), (s_2=2), (s_3=3) is invalid because (s_2) must be greater than (s_1).So, only one possible triplet for (s_1, s_2, s_3): (1, 2, 4). Now, let's find the number of solutions for (a_1, a_2, a_3) such that (a_1 * 1 + a_2 * 2 + a_3 * 4 = 7).So, (a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_3 = 7). Let's find all positive integer solutions.Since (a_3) is at least 1, let's consider possible values for (a_3):1. (a_3 = 1): Then the equation becomes (a_1 + 2a_2 = 3).   - (a_2) can be 1: (a_1 = 1)   - (a_2) can be 2: (a_1 = -1) → Not possible.   So, only 1 solution: (a_1=1), (a_2=1).2. (a_3 = 2): Then the equation becomes (a_1 + 2a_2 = 7 - 8 = -1), which is impossible.So, only 1 solution for (a_3=1).Therefore, for (k=3), there is only 1 solution.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The equation is (a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_3 = 7). If (a_3=1), then (a_1 + 2a_2 = 3). The positive integer solutions are:- (a_2=1): (a_1=1)- (a_2=2): (a_1= -1) → Not allowed.So, only 1 solution. If (a_3=2), then (a_1 + 2a_2 = 7 - 8 = -1), which is impossible. So, yes, only 1 solution.But wait, another thought: (s_3) could be 5, but then (s_1 + s_2 + s_3) would be more than 7. Let me check:If (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=4), sum is 7.If (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=5), sum is 8, which is more than 7. So, no.Similarly, any higher (s_3) would make the sum exceed 7. So, only one triplet.Therefore, for (k=3), 1 solution.Now, moving on to (k=4). The equation becomes:[ a_1 b_1 + a_2 (b_1 + b_2) + a_3 (b_1 + b_2 + b_3) + a_4 (b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4) = 7.]Let me denote (s_1 = b_1), (s_2 = b_1 + b_2), (s_3 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3), (s_4 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4). So, the equation is:[ a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3 + a_4 s_4 = 7.]With (s_1 < s_2 < s_3 < s_4). The minimal sum when (a_i=1) for all (i) is (s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4). The minimal possible (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=3), (s_4=4), sum is 10. But our total is 7, which is less than 10. Therefore, it's impossible to have (k=4). So, no solutions for (k=4).Similarly, for (k geq 4), the minimal sum would be even larger, so no solutions.Therefore, the possible values of (k) are 1, 2, and 3, with 2, 11, and 1 solutions respectively.Adding them up: 2 + 11 + 1 = 14.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.For (k=1): 2 solutions.For (k=2): 11 solutions.For (k=3): 1 solution.Total: 14.But let me think again about (k=3). The triplet (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=4) gives (b_1=1), (b_2=1), (b_3=2). Then, (a_1=1), (a_2=1), (a_3=1). Wait, but in the equation, (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3 = 1*1 + 1*2 + 1*4 = 7). So, that's correct.But is that the only solution? Let me see if there's another way to have (s_1, s_2, s_3) such that (s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 7) with (s_1 < s_2 < s_3). Wait, no, because (s_1, s_2, s_3) are not necessarily the same as the coefficients. The equation is (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3 = 7), not (s_1 + s_2 + s_3 =7). So, my previous reasoning was incorrect.Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. I confused the sum of (s_i) with the weighted sum (a_i s_i). So, actually, (s_1, s_2, s_3) don't have to add up to 7. Instead, their weighted sum with (a_i)s is 7. So, the minimal sum when (a_i=1) is (s_1 + s_2 + s_3), which is at least 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. So, 7 is just 1 more than that.So, in this case, we can have (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=3), and then (a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 =7). Or, we can have (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=4), and (a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_3=7). Or other combinations.Wait, so I need to consider all possible triplets (s_1 < s_2 < s_3) such that (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3 =7), with (a_i geq 1).This complicates things. So, perhaps I should approach this differently.Let me think of the equation as:[ a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3 = 7,]where (1 leq s_1 < s_2 < s_3), and (a_1, a_2, a_3 geq 1).So, we need to find all possible triplets ((s_1, s_2, s_3)) with (s_1 < s_2 < s_3) and positive integers (a_1, a_2, a_3) such that the weighted sum is 7.Let me list all possible triplets ((s_1, s_2, s_3)) such that (s_1 + s_2 + s_3 leq 7) (since each (a_i geq 1), the minimal weighted sum is (s_1 + s_2 + s_3)).Possible triplets:1. (1,2,3): sum is 6. So, (a_1 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 =7). The difference is 1. So, we can increase one of the (a_i)s by 1.   - If (a_1=2), then (2 + 2a_2 + 3a_3 =7) → (2a_2 + 3a_3=5). Let's find solutions:     - (a_3=1): (2a_2=2) → (a_2=1)     - (a_3=2): (2a_2= -1) → Not possible.     So, only 1 solution: (a_1=2), (a_2=1), (a_3=1).   - If (a_2=2): (a_1 + 4 + 3a_3=7) → (a_1 + 3a_3=3).     - (a_3=1): (a_1=0) → Not allowed.     So, no solutions.   - If (a_3=2): (a_1 + 2a_2 +6=7) → (a_1 + 2a_2=1). Not possible since (a_1, a_2 geq1).   So, only 1 solution for this triplet.2. (1,2,4): sum is 7. So, (a_1 + 2a_2 + 4a_3=7). Since (a_1, a_2, a_3 geq1), let's see:   - (a_3=1): (a_1 + 2a_2 =3).     - (a_2=1): (a_1=1)     - (a_2=2): (a_1= -1) → Not possible.     So, 1 solution: (a_1=1), (a_2=1), (a_3=1).   - (a_3=2): (a_1 + 2a_2= -1) → Not possible.   So, only 1 solution.3. (1,3,4): sum is 8, which is more than 7. So, impossible.4. (2,3,4): sum is 9, which is more than 7. So, impossible.Are there any other triplets? Let's see:- (1,2,5): sum is 8, too big.- (1,2,6): sum is 9, too big.- (1,3,5): sum is 9, too big.- Etc.So, only two triplets: (1,2,3) and (1,2,4).For (1,2,3): 1 solution.For (1,2,4): 1 solution.So, total solutions for (k=3): 2.Wait, but earlier I thought only 1 solution. So, I must have made a mistake.Wait, no. For triplet (1,2,3), we have 1 solution, and for (1,2,4), we have another solution. So, total 2 solutions for (k=3).But wait, let me verify.For (1,2,3):- (a_1=2), (a_2=1), (a_3=1). So, (2*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 = 2 + 2 + 3 =7).For (1,2,4):- (a_1=1), (a_2=1), (a_3=1). So, (1*1 + 1*2 + 1*4 =1 + 2 +4=7).Yes, both are valid. So, 2 solutions for (k=3).Therefore, my previous count was wrong. It's actually 2 solutions for (k=3).So, updating the total:(k=1): 2(k=2):11(k=3):2Total: 2 + 11 + 2 =15.Wait, but hold on. Let me check if there are more triplets.Is there a triplet (1,3,3)? No, because (s_3) must be greater than (s_2).What about (1,2,2)? No, same reason.So, only (1,2,3) and (1,2,4) are possible.Therefore, 2 solutions for (k=3).So, total solutions: 2 + 11 + 2 =15.Wait, but let me think again. For (k=3), each triplet corresponds to specific (b_i). For (1,2,3):- (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=3). So, (b_1=1), (b_2=1), (b_3=1).But wait, (s_3 = s_2 + b_3) → (3 = 2 + b_3) → (b_3=1).Similarly, for (1,2,4):- (s_1=1), (s_2=2), (s_3=4). So, (b_1=1), (b_2=1), (b_3=2).So, each triplet gives a unique set of (b_i). Therefore, each solution for (a_i) corresponds to a unique solution in terms of (a_i) and (b_i).Therefore, for (k=3), 2 solutions.So, total solutions: 2 (k=1) + 11 (k=2) + 2 (k=3) =15.Wait, but earlier I thought (k=3) had 2 solutions, but initially I thought 1. So, now it's 15.But let me think again about (k=2). I had 11 solutions. Let me recount that.For (k=2), we had:- (s_1=1): 8 solutions- (s_1=2): 2 solutions- (s_1=3):1 solutionTotal:11.But let me check if each of these corresponds to unique (b_1, b_2).Yes, because for each (s_1, s_2), (b_1 = s_1), (b_2 = s_2 - s_1). So, each pair ((s_1, s_2)) gives a unique (b_1, b_2). Therefore, 11 solutions for (k=2).So, 2 + 11 + 2 =15.Wait, but let me think about (k=3) again. The triplet (1,2,3) gives (b_1=1), (b_2=1), (b_3=1), and the triplet (1,2,4) gives (b_1=1), (b_2=1), (b_3=2). So, these are two distinct solutions.Therefore, 2 solutions for (k=3).So, total solutions:15.But wait, another thought: when (k=3), the equation is (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3 =7). We found two triplets for (s_1, s_2, s_3), each giving one solution for (a_i). So, 2 solutions.Therefore, total solutions:2 +11 +2=15.But now, let me think about (k=4). Earlier, I thought it's impossible because the minimal sum is 10, but actually, the minimal weighted sum is (s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4), which is at least 1 + 2 + 3 +4=10, which is more than 7. So, no solutions for (k geq4).So, total solutions:15.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed some triplets for (k=3).Wait, another triplet could be (1,2,5), but (s_1 + s_2 + s_3=8), which is more than 7, so (a_1 s_1 + a_2 s_2 + a_3 s_3=7) would require some (a_i) to be zero, which is not allowed.Similarly, (1,3,4): sum is 8, which is more than 7. So, no.Therefore, only two triplets for (k=3).So, total solutions:15.Wait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe using generating functions or combinatorial interpretations.Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a different form.Let me consider the original equation:[ a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}(b_{1} + b_{2}) + cdots + a_{k}(b_{1} + b_{2} + cdots + b_{k}) = 7.]Let me rewrite this equation by expanding the terms:= (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_1 + a_3 b_2 + a_3 b_3 + cdots + a_k b_1 + cdots + a_k b_k)Now, let's group the terms by (b_j):= (b_1 (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + cdots + a_k) + b_2 (a_2 + a_3 + cdots + a_k) + cdots + b_k a_k =7).So, let me denote (c_j = a_j + a_{j+1} + cdots + a_k). Then, the equation becomes:[ c_1 b_1 + c_2 b_2 + cdots + c_k b_k =7.]Where (c_j) are positive integers because each (a_i) is positive, so each (c_j) is at least 1.Moreover, since (c_j = a_j + c_{j+1}), we have (c_j > c_{j+1}) for all (j=1,2,ldots,k-1). So, the sequence (c_1, c_2, ldots, c_k) is strictly decreasing.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of solutions in positive integers (c_1 > c_2 > cdots > c_k geq1) and (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k geq1) such that:[ c_1 b_1 + c_2 b_2 + cdots + c_k b_k =7.]This seems like a partition problem where we need to express 7 as a sum of terms (c_j b_j), with (c_j) strictly decreasing positive integers, and (b_j) positive integers.This might be a more manageable way to think about it.So, essentially, we need to find all possible sequences of strictly decreasing positive integers (c_1 > c_2 > cdots > c_k) and positive integers (b_j) such that their weighted sum is 7.This is similar to finding all possible factorizations of 7 with certain constraints.Since 7 is a small number, we can enumerate all possible partitions.Let me list all possible partitions of 7 into terms where each term is a product of a positive integer (c_j) and a positive integer (b_j), with (c_j) strictly decreasing.Each such partition corresponds to a solution.Let me consider the possible values of (k):1. (k=1): Then, (c_1 b_1 =7). Since (c_1) is a positive integer, the possible pairs are (1,7), (7,1). But since (c_1) must be strictly decreasing, but (k=1), so it's just (7,1) and (1,7). Wait, but in our previous notation, (c_1) is just a positive integer, so both are valid. But in the context of the problem, (c_1) is just a positive integer, so both are valid. So, 2 solutions.2. (k=2): We need (c_1 > c_2 geq1), and (c_1 b_1 + c_2 b_2 =7).   Let me list all possible pairs ((c_1, c_2)) with (c_1 > c_2):   - (2,1): Then, equation is (2b_1 + b_2=7). Number of positive integer solutions:     - (b_1=1): (b_2=5)     - (b_1=2): (b_2=3)     - (b_1=3): (b_2=1)     So, 3 solutions.   - (3,1): Equation is (3b_1 + b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (b_2=4)     - (b_1=2): (b_2=1)     So, 2 solutions.   - (3,2): Equation is (3b_1 + 2b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (2b_2=4) → (b_2=2)     - (b_1=2): (2b_2=1) → Not possible.     So, 1 solution.   - (4,1): Equation is (4b_1 + b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (b_2=3)     - (b_1=2): (b_2= -1) → Not possible.     So, 1 solution.   - (4,2): Equation is (4b_1 + 2b_2=7). Since 4b1 is even and 2b2 is even, their sum is even, but 7 is odd. No solutions.   - (4,3): Equation is (4b_1 + 3b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (3b_2=3) → (b_2=1)     So, 1 solution.   - (5,1): Equation is (5b_1 + b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (b_2=2)     So, 1 solution.   - (5,2): Equation is (5b_1 + 2b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (2b_2=2) → (b_2=1)     So, 1 solution.   - (5,3): Equation is (5b_1 + 3b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (3b_2=2) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   - (5,4): Equation is (5b_1 + 4b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (4b_2=2) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   - (6,1): Equation is (6b_1 + b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (b_2=1)     So, 1 solution.   - (6,2): Equation is (6b_1 + 2b_2=7). Even + even = even ≠7. No solutions.   - (6,3): Equation is (6b_1 + 3b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (3b_2=1) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   - (6,4): Equation is (6b_1 + 4b_2=7). Even + even = even ≠7. No solutions.   - (6,5): Equation is (6b_1 + 5b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (5b_2=1) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   - (7,1): Equation is (7b_1 + b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (b_2=0) → Not allowed.     So, no solutions.   - (7,2): Equation is (7b_1 + 2b_2=7).     - (b_1=1): (2b_2=0) → Not allowed.     So, no solutions.   - Similarly, higher (c_1) will not work because (c_1 b_1) would exceed 7.   So, compiling the solutions for (k=2):   - (2,1):3   - (3,1):2   - (3,2):1   - (4,1):1   - (4,3):1   - (5,1):1   - (5,2):1   - (6,1):1   Total:3+2+1+1+1+1+1+1=11 solutions.   So, same as before, 11 solutions for (k=2).3. (k=3): Now, we need (c_1 > c_2 > c_3 geq1), and (c_1 b_1 + c_2 b_2 + c_3 b_3=7).   Let me list all possible triplets ((c_1, c_2, c_3)) with (c_1 > c_2 > c_3).   Possible triplets:   - (3,2,1): Equation is (3b_1 + 2b_2 + b_3=7).     Let's find positive integer solutions:     - (b_3=1): (3b_1 + 2b_2=6).       - (b_2=1): (3b_1=4) → Not possible.       - (b_2=2): (3b_1=2) → Not possible.       - (b_2=3): (3b_1=0) → Not possible.     - (b_3=2): (3b_1 + 2b_2=5).       - (b_2=1): (3b_1=3) → (b_1=1)       - (b_2=2): (3b_1=1) → Not possible.       So, 1 solution: (b_1=1), (b_2=1), (b_3=2).     - (b_3=3): (3b_1 + 2b_2=4).       - (b_2=1): (3b_1=2) → Not possible.       - (b_2=2): (3b_1=0) → Not possible.     So, only 1 solution.   - (4,2,1): Equation is (4b_1 + 2b_2 + b_3=7).     Let's find solutions:     - (b_3=1): (4b_1 + 2b_2=6).       - (b_2=1): (4b_1=4) → (b_1=1)       - (b_2=2): (4b_1=2) → Not possible.       So, 1 solution: (b_1=1), (b_2=1), (b_3=1).     - (b_3=2): (4b_1 + 2b_2=5). Not possible since LHS is even, RHS is odd.     - (b_3=3): (4b_1 + 2b_2=4).       - (b_2=1): (4b_1=2) → Not possible.       - (b_2=2): (4b_1=0) → Not possible.     So, only 1 solution.   - (5,2,1): Equation is (5b_1 + 2b_2 + b_3=7).     Let's find solutions:     - (b_3=1): (5b_1 + 2b_2=6).       - (b_2=1): (5b_1=4) → Not possible.       - (b_2=2): (5b_1=2) → Not possible.       - (b_2=3): (5b_1=0) → Not possible.     - (b_3=2): (5b_1 + 2b_2=5).       - (b_2=1): (5b_1=3) → Not possible.       - (b_2=2): (5b_1=1) → Not possible.     - (b_3=3): (5b_1 + 2b_2=4). Not possible.     So, no solutions.   - (4,3,1): Equation is (4b_1 + 3b_2 + b_3=7).     Let's find solutions:     - (b_3=1): (4b_1 + 3b_2=6).       - (b_2=1): (4b_1=3) → Not possible.       - (b_2=2): (4b_1=0) → Not possible.     - (b_3=2): (4b_1 + 3b_2=5).       - (b_2=1): (4b_1=2) → Not possible.     - (b_3=3): (4b_1 + 3b_2=4).       - (b_2=1): (4b_1=1) → Not possible.     So, no solutions.   - (3,2,1): Already considered above.   - (2,1, something): Not possible since (c_3) must be at least 1, but (c_2 > c_3), so (c_3) can be 1, but (c_2) must be at least 2, (c_1) at least 3. So, only triplets like (3,2,1), (4,2,1), etc.   So, only two triplets: (3,2,1) and (4,2,1), each giving 1 solution.   Therefore, 2 solutions for (k=3).4. (k=4): As before, minimal sum is 10, which is more than 7. So, no solutions.Therefore, total solutions:2 (k=1) +11 (k=2) +2 (k=3)=15.Wait, but in the generating function approach, the number of solutions should be equal to the number of compositions of 7 with certain restrictions. But I think my enumeration is correct.So, the final answer is 15.But wait, let me check once more.For (k=1):2For (k=2):11For (k=3):2Total:15.Yes, that seems correct.**Final Answer**boxed{15}"},{"question":"The average score of a fifth-grade math test is 72 points, and the total score is □46□, where the squares contain unclear numbers. Based on this score sheet, it can be determined that there are ______ students in this class.","answer":"First, I need to determine the total score of the math test, which is given as □46□. This means the total score is a four-digit number where the thousands and units digits are unknown. I'll represent the total score as 1000a + 460 + b, where a and b are the unknown digits.Next, I know that the average score is 72 points. The average score is calculated by dividing the total score by the number of students. Therefore, the total score must be a multiple of 72.To find the possible values of a and b, I'll set up the equation:1000a + 460 + b = 72nwhere n is the number of students.Since the total score must be divisible by 72, I'll check the divisibility rules for 72, which is the least common multiple of 8 and 9. This means the total score must be divisible by both 8 and 9.For divisibility by 8, the last three digits of the total score must be divisible by 8. This gives me the condition:460 + b ≡ 0 (mod 8)Solving this, I find that b can be 4.For divisibility by 9, the sum of all digits must be divisible by 9. This gives me the condition:a + 4 + 6 + b ≡ 0 (mod 9)Substituting b = 4, I get:a + 14 ≡ 0 (mod 9)This simplifies to a ≡ 4 (mod 9). Since a is a single digit, a must be 4.Now, substituting a = 4 and b = 4 into the total score, I get:Total score = 1000*4 + 460 + 4 = 4464Finally, to find the number of students, I'll divide the total score by the average score:Number of students = 4464 / 72 = 62Therefore, there are 62 students in the class."},{"question":"A speedboat departs from pier A, travels downstream to pier B, and continues downstream to pier C. After reaching pier C, it immediately turns around and travels back upstream to pier B, taking a total of 10 hours. If the distance between A and B is 20 kilometers, the speed of the speedboat in still water is 40 kilometers per hour, and the river's current speed is 10 kilometers per hour, find the distance between B and C.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a speedboat traveling between three piers: A, B, and C. Let me try to visualize the scenario first. The boat starts at pier A, goes downstream to pier B, then continues downstream to pier C. After reaching C, it turns around and goes back upstream to pier B. The total time for this entire trip is 10 hours. Given information:- Distance from A to B is 20 km.- The speed of the speedboat in still water is 40 km/h.- The river's current speed is 10 km/h.- We need to find the distance between B and C.Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out the effective speeds of the boat when it's going downstream and upstream. Since the current affects the boat's speed, downstream speed will be the sum of the boat's speed and the current's speed, while upstream speed will be the difference.So, downstream speed = boat speed + current speed = 40 km/h + 10 km/h = 50 km/h.Upstream speed = boat speed - current speed = 40 km/h - 10 km/h = 30 km/h.Got that. Now, let's denote the distance between B and C as x kilometers. That's what we need to find.Now, the boat's journey can be divided into three parts:1. From A to B: 20 km downstream.2. From B to C: x km downstream.3. From C back to B: x km upstream.Wait, hold on. The problem says the boat goes from A to B, then continues downstream to C, then immediately turns around and goes back upstream to B. So, the total trip is A -> B -> C -> B. So, the boat doesn't go back all the way to A, just to B.Therefore, the total distance traveled is:- A to B: 20 km downstream.- B to C: x km downstream.- C to B: x km upstream.So, the total time is the sum of the times taken for each leg of the journey. Let's write that as an equation.Total time = time from A to B + time from B to C + time from C to B.We know the total time is 10 hours. So,Time_A_to_B + Time_B_to_C + Time_C_to_B = 10 hours.Now, let's compute each time.Time_A_to_B: distance is 20 km, speed is downstream speed, which is 50 km/h. So, time = distance/speed = 20/50 hours.Time_B_to_C: distance is x km, speed is downstream speed, 50 km/h. So, time = x/50 hours.Time_C_to_B: distance is x km, speed is upstream speed, 30 km/h. So, time = x/30 hours.Putting it all together:20/50 + x/50 + x/30 = 10.Let me write that equation again:(20)/50 + (x)/50 + (x)/30 = 10.Simplify the fractions:20/50 is 0.4, which is 2/5.So, 2/5 + x/50 + x/30 = 10.Now, let's combine the terms with x.First, find a common denominator for 50 and 30. The least common multiple of 50 and 30 is 150.So, x/50 is equal to 3x/150, and x/30 is equal to 5x/150.So, adding them together: 3x/150 + 5x/150 = 8x/150.Simplify 8x/150: divide numerator and denominator by 2, we get 4x/75.So, the equation becomes:2/5 + 4x/75 = 10.Now, let's subtract 2/5 from both sides:4x/75 = 10 - 2/5.Convert 10 to fifths: 10 = 50/5, so 50/5 - 2/5 = 48/5.So, 4x/75 = 48/5.Now, solve for x.Multiply both sides by 75:4x = (48/5) * 75.Calculate (48/5)*75: 75 divided by 5 is 15, so 48*15.48*15: 40*15=600, 8*15=120, so 600+120=720.So, 4x = 720.Divide both sides by 4:x = 720 / 4 = 180.Wait, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations.Wait, 4x = 720, so x = 180 km? That seems like a lot. Let me verify the steps.First, the equation:20/50 + x/50 + x/30 = 10.Simplify:20/50 is 0.4, which is correct.x/50 + x/30: Let's compute this again.x/50 + x/30. Let's find a common denominator, which is 150.x/50 = 3x/150, x/30 = 5x/150. So, 3x + 5x = 8x over 150, which is 8x/150, simplifies to 4x/75. That's correct.So, 2/5 + 4x/75 = 10.Subtract 2/5: 4x/75 = 10 - 2/5.10 is 50/5, so 50/5 - 2/5 = 48/5. Correct.So, 4x/75 = 48/5.Multiply both sides by 75: 4x = (48/5)*75.Compute (48/5)*75: 75 divided by 5 is 15, so 48*15=720. Correct.So, 4x=720, so x=180. Hmm, 180 km.Wait, but the distance from A to B is only 20 km. So, if B to C is 180 km, then the total downstream trip from A to C is 200 km, which would take 200/50=4 hours. Then, the upstream trip from C to B is 180 km, which would take 180/30=6 hours. So, total time is 4 + 6=10 hours. Wait, but that's only considering A to C and back to B. But in the problem, the boat goes from A to B (20 km) in 20/50=0.4 hours, then from B to C (180 km) in 180/50=3.6 hours, then from C back to B (180 km) in 180/30=6 hours. So, total time is 0.4 + 3.6 + 6=10 hours. That adds up.Wait, but 180 km seems quite far. Is that correct? Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\\"A speedboat departs from pier A, travels downstream to pier B, and continues downstream to pier C. After reaching pier C, it immediately turns around and travels back upstream to pier B, taking a total of 10 hours.\\"So, the total trip is A -> B -> C -> B, which is 20 + x + x km. But in terms of time, it's 20/50 + x/50 + x/30 = 10.So, the calculation seems correct. Maybe 180 km is the right answer, even though it's a long distance. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.Wait, let me think again. Maybe the boat doesn't go from A to B to C and back to B, but perhaps from A to B, then from B to C, then from C back to A? But the problem says it goes back to pier B, not to A. So, the total trip is A -> B -> C -> B.So, the distances are: A to B is 20 km, B to C is x km, then C back to B is x km. So, the total distance is 20 + x + x = 20 + 2x km.But in terms of time, it's 20/50 + x/50 + x/30 = 10 hours.So, the equation is correct.Wait, but 180 km is 180 km downstream from B. So, the total downstream trip from A is 20 + 180 = 200 km, which at 50 km/h is 4 hours. Then, the upstream trip is 180 km at 30 km/h, which is 6 hours. So, total time is 4 + 6 = 10 hours. But wait, that's only considering A to C and back to B. But actually, the boat goes from A to B (0.4 hours), then B to C (3.6 hours), then C back to B (6 hours). So, total time is 0.4 + 3.6 + 6 = 10 hours. That matches.So, even though 180 km seems long, it's correct.Wait, but let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. It says the boat departs from A, goes downstream to B, then continues downstream to C, then turns around and goes back upstream to B. So, the total trip is A -> B -> C -> B. So, the distances are 20 km, x km, and x km. So, the times are 20/50, x/50, x/30. So, the equation is correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the way I set up the equation. Let me try another approach.Let me denote the distance from B to C as x km.So, the boat's journey is:1. From A to B: 20 km downstream. Time = 20 / (40 + 10) = 20 / 50 = 0.4 hours.2. From B to C: x km downstream. Time = x / 50 hours.3. From C back to B: x km upstream. Time = x / (40 - 10) = x / 30 hours.Total time: 0.4 + x/50 + x/30 = 10.So, same equation as before.So, 0.4 + x/50 + x/30 = 10.Let me compute x/50 + x/30.x/50 + x/30 = x(1/50 + 1/30) = x( (3 + 5)/150 ) = x(8/150) = x(4/75).So, 0.4 + 4x/75 = 10.Subtract 0.4: 4x/75 = 9.6.Multiply both sides by 75: 4x = 9.6 * 75.Compute 9.6 * 75:9 * 75 = 675, 0.6 * 75 = 45, so total is 675 + 45 = 720.So, 4x = 720 => x = 180.Same result. So, it's correct.Therefore, the distance between B and C is 180 km.But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because 180 km is quite a distance. Let me think about the speeds again.The boat's downstream speed is 50 km/h, so going 180 km downstream would take 180/50 = 3.6 hours. Then, going back upstream at 30 km/h would take 180/30 = 6 hours. So, the time from B to C and back is 3.6 + 6 = 9.6 hours. Adding the initial 0.4 hours from A to B, total is 10 hours. That checks out.So, despite the large distance, the math adds up. So, the answer is 180 km.Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to interpret the problem? For example, maybe the boat goes from A to B, then from B to C, then from C back to A? But the problem says it goes back to pier B, not A. So, no, that's not the case.Alternatively, maybe the boat goes from A to B, then from B to C, then from C back to A? But that would be a different problem, and the total time would be different. But the problem says it goes back to pier B, so it's A -> B -> C -> B.So, I think my initial approach is correct.Therefore, the distance between B and C is 180 km.**Final Answer**The distance between pier B and pier C is boxed{180} kilometers."},{"question":"A triangle has three different integer side lengths and a perimeter of 20 units. What is the maximum length of any one side?","answer":"To determine the maximum possible length of one side of a triangle with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 20 units, I start by letting the sides be ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ), where ( a < b < c ). The perimeter condition gives ( a + b + c = 20 ).To maximize ( c ), I need to minimize ( a ) and ( b ) while ensuring the triangle inequality holds, which states that the sum of the two shorter sides must be greater than the longest side. Starting with the smallest possible integer values for ( a ) and ( b ), I test different combinations:1. If ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 2 ), then ( c = 17 ). However, ( 1 + 2 = 3 ), which is not greater than ( 17 ), violating the triangle inequality.2. Increasing ( b ) to ( 3 ), ( c ) becomes ( 16 ). Again, ( 1 + 3 = 4 ), which is not greater than ( 16 ), so this also doesn't work.3. Continuing this process, I find that when ( a = 6 ) and ( b = 7 ), ( c = 7 ). However, since ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) must be different, this combination is invalid.Finally, setting ( a = 5 ), ( b = 6 ), and ( c = 9 ) satisfies all conditions: ( 5 + 6 + 9 = 20 ) and ( 5 + 6 = 11 ), which is greater than ( 9 ). Therefore, the maximum possible length of one side is 9 units."},{"question":"Find all integer solutions to the equation (21x + 48y = 6).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find all integer solutions to the equation (21x + 48y = 6). Hmm, I remember this is a linear Diophantine equation. I think the first step is to check if 6 is a multiple of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 21 and 48. If it is, then there are solutions; otherwise, there aren't any. Let me calculate the gcd of 21 and 48. Using the Euclidean algorithm: First, divide 48 by 21. 21 goes into 48 twice with a remainder. 21*2 is 42, so the remainder is 48 - 42 = 6. Now, take 21 and divide by the remainder 6. 6 goes into 21 three times with a remainder of 3, because 6*3 is 18, and 21 - 18 = 3.Next, take 6 and divide by the remainder 3. 3 goes into 6 exactly 2 times with no remainder. Since the last non-zero remainder is 3, the gcd of 21 and 48 is 3. Now, check if 3 divides 6. Yes, because 6 divided by 3 is 2, which is an integer. So, there are integer solutions to this equation. But wait, the equation is (21x + 48y = 6), which is 3 times the gcd. So, I think the general solution can be found by first solving the equation (7x + 16y = 2) because if I divide both sides by 3, I get that. So, let me work with that simpler equation: (7x + 16y = 2).To solve (7x + 16y = 2), I need to find particular solutions. Maybe I can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers x and y such that 7x + 16y = 1, and then multiply both sides by 2 to get the solution for 2.Let me apply the extended Euclidean algorithm to 7 and 16.First, divide 16 by 7: 16 = 2*7 + 2. Then, divide 7 by the remainder 2: 7 = 3*2 + 1.Next, divide 2 by the remainder 1: 2 = 2*1 + 0.So, the gcd is 1, which we already knew. Now, working backwards to express 1 as a linear combination of 7 and 16.From the second step: 1 = 7 - 3*2.But 2 is from the first step: 2 = 16 - 2*7.Substitute that into the equation for 1:1 = 7 - 3*(16 - 2*7) = 7 - 3*16 + 6*7 = (1 + 6)*7 - 3*16 = 7*7 - 3*16.So, 1 = 7*7 - 3*16. Therefore, multiplying both sides by 2 to get 2:2 = 14*7 - 6*16.So, a particular solution is x = 14 and y = -6.But wait, let me check that: 7*14 + 16*(-6) = 98 - 96 = 2. Yes, that works.So, the particular solution is x = 14, y = -6.Now, the general solution for the equation (7x + 16y = 2) can be written as:x = x0 + (16/d)t = 14 + 16ty = y0 - (7/d)t = -6 - 7tWhere d is the gcd of 7 and 16, which is 1, and t is any integer.So, substituting back, the solutions are:x = 14 + 16ty = -6 - 7tBut remember, we scaled down the original equation by dividing by 3. So, the original equation was (21x + 48y = 6), which is 3*(7x + 16y) = 3*2. So, the solutions for the original equation will be the same as for (7x + 16y = 2), because we just scaled both sides by 3. Wait, no, actually, the particular solution we found was for (7x + 16y = 2), so when we go back to the original equation, we need to adjust accordingly.Wait, no, actually, since we divided the original equation by 3, the solutions for the original equation will be the same as the solutions for (7x + 16y = 2), because 21x + 48y = 6 is equivalent to 7x + 16y = 2 when you divide both sides by 3. So, the solutions we found for x and y in terms of t are already solutions for the original equation.But let me verify that. Let's plug x = 14 + 16t and y = -6 -7t into the original equation:21x + 48y = 21*(14 + 16t) + 48*(-6 -7t)Calculate each term:21*14 = 29421*16t = 336t48*(-6) = -28848*(-7t) = -336tSo, adding them up:294 + 336t - 288 - 336t = (294 - 288) + (336t - 336t) = 6 + 0 = 6.Yes, that works. So, the solutions are correct.Therefore, all integer solutions are given by:x = 14 + 16ty = -6 -7tfor any integer t.But wait, let me think again. Since the original equation was 21x + 48y = 6, and we found that the general solution is x = 14 + 16t and y = -6 -7t, is that correct? Because sometimes when scaling, the coefficients can affect the step size.Wait, no, because when we divided by 3, the equation became 7x + 16y = 2, and the solutions for that are x = 14 + 16t, y = -6 -7t. So, since 7 and 16 are coprime, the step sizes are 16 and 7 respectively. Therefore, the solutions for the original equation are the same as for the scaled equation because we just scaled both sides by 3, but the variables x and y are the same. So, yes, the solutions are correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the general solution for ax + by = c, when d = gcd(a,b) divides c, is given by x = x0 + (b/d)t and y = y0 - (a/d)t, where x0 and y0 are particular solutions.In our case, a = 21, b = 48, c = 6, d = 3. So, the general solution should be:x = x0 + (48/3)t = x0 + 16ty = y0 - (21/3)t = y0 -7tWhich matches what we found earlier. So, yes, the solutions are correct.Therefore, all integer solutions are given by:x = 14 + 16ty = -6 -7tfor any integer t.Wait, but let me check with t = 0: x =14, y = -6. Plugging into original equation: 21*14 +48*(-6)= 294 -288=6. Correct.t=1: x=30, y=-13. 21*30=630, 48*(-13)=-624. 630-624=6. Correct.t=-1: x=14-16= -2, y=-6+7=1. 21*(-2)= -42, 48*1=48. -42+48=6. Correct.So, yes, the solutions are correct.Therefore, the integer solutions are all pairs (x,y) where x=14+16t and y=-6-7t for some integer t.Alternatively, we can write the solutions as:x = 14 + 16ty = -6 -7twhere t ∈ ℤ.So, that's the final answer."},{"question":"The output of the following program after execution is S=______.i=1S=0WHILE i <=50S=S+ii=i+1WENDPRINT SEND","answer":"First, I recognize that the program initializes two variables: ( i = 1 ) and ( S = 0 ).

The variables (a), (b), and (c) are distinct real numbers, and each of them satisfies the equation (x^3 - 2020x^2 + 1010 = 0). Hmm, that seems like a cubic equation with three roots, which are (a), (b), and (c). I remember that for a cubic equation of the form (x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0), the sum of the roots is (-p), the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is (q), and the product of the roots is (-r). Maybe I can use Vieta's formulas here. Let me write down the given equation again to see the coefficients:The equation is (x^3 - 2020x^2 + 1010 = 0). So comparing this to the standard form (x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0), I can see that (p = -2020), (q = 0) (since there's no (x) term), and (r = 1010). Wait, is that right? Let me check:Given equation: (x^3 - 2020x^2 + 1010 = 0).So, in standard form, it's (x^3 + (-2020)x^2 + 0x + 1010 = 0). Yeah, so (p = -2020), (q = 0), and (r = 1010).So applying Vieta's formulas:1. Sum of roots: (a + b + c = -p = 2020).2. Sum of products two at a time: (ab + bc + ac = q = 0).3. Product of roots: (abc = -r = -1010).Alright, so I have these three pieces of information.Now, the expression I need to compute is (frac{1}{ab} + frac{1}{bc} + frac{1}{ac}). Let me see if I can express this in terms of (a), (b), and (c) in a way that relates to Vieta's formulas.First, let's write the expression:[frac{1}{ab} + frac{1}{bc} + frac{1}{ac}]I can factor out (frac{1}{abc}) from each term:[frac{1}{ab} + frac{1}{bc} + frac{1}{ac} = frac{c + a + b}{abc}]Wait, let me check that:[frac{1}{ab} = frac{c}{abc}, quad frac{1}{bc} = frac{a}{abc}, quad frac{1}{ac} = frac{b}{abc}]So adding them together:[frac{c}{abc} + frac{a}{abc} + frac{b}{abc} = frac{a + b + c}{abc}]Yes, that's correct. So the expression simplifies to (frac{a + b + c}{abc}).From Vieta's formulas, I already know (a + b + c = 2020) and (abc = -1010). So substituting these values in:[frac{a + b + c}{abc} = frac{2020}{-1010} = -2]So the value of the expression is (-2). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. The key step was recognizing that (frac{1}{ab} + frac{1}{bc} + frac{1}{ac}) can be rewritten as (frac{a + b + c}{abc}). That seems right because each term is (frac{1}{ab}), which is (frac{c}{abc}), and similarly for the others. So adding them gives the sum of (a + b + c) over (abc).Given that (a + b + c = 2020) and (abc = -1010), plugging in gives (frac{2020}{-1010}), which simplifies to (-2). Just to double-check, let me compute (frac{2020}{-1010}). Dividing both numerator and denominator by 1010 gives (frac{2}{-1} = -2). Yep, that's correct.So, I think I'm confident that the value is (-2).**Final Answer**boxed{-2}"},{"question":"Evaluate the integral int_{0}^{2} (3x^2 + k) , dx = 10, then find the value of k.","answer":"To solve the integral equation ∫₀² (3x² + k) dx = 10 and find the value of k, I'll start by evaluating the integral.First, I'll integrate each term separately.

So, the integral becomes [x³ + kx] evaluated from 0 to 2.Next, I'll substitute the upper limit of integration, x = 2, into the expression: (2)³ + k*(2) = 8 + 2k.Then, I'll substitute the lower limit, x = 0, into the expression: (0)³ + k*(0) = 0.Subtracting the lower limit result from the upper limit result gives 8 + 2k - 0 = 8 + 2k.Now, I'll set this equal to 10 and solve for k: 8 + 2k = 10.

Find a_{6}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that the sum of the first n terms is denoted as S_n, and it gives two conditions: S₂ = 3 and S₃ - S₁ = 6. I need to find a₆, which is the sixth term of the sequence.First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, if the first term is a, then the sequence goes a, ar, ar², ar³, and so on.The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula:S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), when r ≠ 1.If r = 1, then the sum would just be S_n = a * n, but since the problem doesn't specify that, I think we can assume r ≠ 1.So, given that, let me write down the given information in terms of the formula.First, S₂ = 3. That means the sum of the first two terms is 3. Using the formula:S₂ = a * (1 - r²) / (1 - r) = 3.Similarly, S₃ - S₁ = 6. Let me compute S₃ and S₁ separately.S₃ = a * (1 - r³) / (1 - r), and S₁ is just the first term, which is a. So, S₃ - S₁ = [a * (1 - r³) / (1 - r)] - a = 6.Let me simplify that expression:S₃ - S₁ = [a * (1 - r³) / (1 - r)] - a = a * [ (1 - r³)/(1 - r) - 1 ] = 6.Let me compute the term inside the brackets:(1 - r³)/(1 - r) - 1 = [ (1 - r³) - (1 - r) ] / (1 - r) = [1 - r³ - 1 + r] / (1 - r) = (r - r³) / (1 - r).Factor out an r from the numerator:r(1 - r²) / (1 - r).So, S₃ - S₁ = a * [ r(1 - r²) / (1 - r) ] = 6.But wait, let me see if I can simplify that further. The numerator is r(1 - r²) and the denominator is (1 - r). Notice that 1 - r² can be factored as (1 - r)(1 + r). So:r(1 - r)(1 + r) / (1 - r) = r(1 + r).So, S₃ - S₁ = a * r(1 + r) = 6.So, now I have two equations:1) a * (1 - r²) / (1 - r) = 3.2) a * r(1 + r) = 6.Let me write them down:Equation 1: a * (1 - r²)/(1 - r) = 3.Equation 2: a * r(1 + r) = 6.Hmm, maybe I can express a from Equation 1 and substitute into Equation 2.From Equation 1:a = 3 * (1 - r) / (1 - r²).But 1 - r² is (1 - r)(1 + r), so:a = 3 * (1 - r) / [ (1 - r)(1 + r) ] = 3 / (1 + r).So, a = 3 / (1 + r).Okay, so now I can substitute this into Equation 2:a * r(1 + r) = 6.Substituting a:(3 / (1 + r)) * r(1 + r) = 6.Simplify:The (1 + r) terms cancel out:3 * r = 6.So, 3r = 6 => r = 2.So, the common ratio r is 2.Now, let's find a. From earlier, a = 3 / (1 + r) = 3 / (1 + 2) = 3 / 3 = 1.So, the first term a is 1, and the common ratio r is 2.Therefore, the geometric sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on.Now, the problem asks for a₆, which is the sixth term.In a geometric sequence, the nth term is given by a_n = a * r^(n - 1).So, a₆ = 1 * 2^(6 - 1) = 2^5 = 32.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, S₂ = a + ar = 1 + 2 = 3. That's correct.Then, S₃ = a + ar + ar² = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.S₁ is just a = 1.So, S₃ - S₁ = 7 - 1 = 6. That's also correct.So, the calculations seem right. Therefore, a₆ is 32.But just to be thorough, let me write out the terms:a₁ = 1,a₂ = 2,a₃ = 4,a₄ = 8,a₅ = 16,a₆ = 32.Yep, that looks correct.So, the answer should be 32.**Final Answer**The sixth term of the geometric sequence is boxed{32}."},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: ({2a+sqrt{3}})({2a-sqrt{3}})-3a({a-2})+3, where a=sqrt{2}-3.","answer":"Okay, so I need to simplify and evaluate the expression ((2a + sqrt{3})(2a - sqrt{3}) - 3a(a - 2) + 3) where (a = sqrt{2} - 3). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, I notice that the expression has two main parts: the product of two binomials and then a quadratic term. Maybe I can simplify each part separately before plugging in the value of (a). That might make things easier.Starting with the first part: ((2a + sqrt{3})(2a - sqrt{3})). This looks like a difference of squares because it's in the form ((x + y)(x - y)), which simplifies to (x^2 - y^2). So, applying that here, I can rewrite this as:[(2a)^2 - (sqrt{3})^2]Calculating each term:- ((2a)^2 = 4a^2)- ((sqrt{3})^2 = 3)So, the first part simplifies to (4a^2 - 3).Next, moving on to the second part: (-3a(a - 2)). I'll distribute the (-3a) across the parentheses:[-3a cdot a + (-3a) cdot (-2) = -3a^2 + 6a]So, the second part simplifies to (-3a^2 + 6a).Now, putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:[(4a^2 - 3) + (-3a^2 + 6a) + 3]Let me combine like terms. First, combine the (a^2) terms:- (4a^2 - 3a^2 = a^2)Next, the constant terms:- (-3 + 3 = 0)And then the linear term:- (6a)So, after combining like terms, the expression simplifies to:[a^2 + 6a]Hmm, that's much simpler! Now, I just need to substitute (a = sqrt{2} - 3) into this simplified expression.Let me write that out:[(sqrt{2} - 3)^2 + 6(sqrt{2} - 3)]I'll compute each part separately.First, expanding ((sqrt{2} - 3)^2). Using the formula ((x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2):- (x = sqrt{2}), so (x^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 = 2)- (y = 3), so (y^2 = 9)- The middle term is (-2xy = -2 cdot sqrt{2} cdot 3 = -6sqrt{2})Putting it together:[(sqrt{2} - 3)^2 = 2 - 6sqrt{2} + 9 = (2 + 9) - 6sqrt{2} = 11 - 6sqrt{2}]Next, computing (6(sqrt{2} - 3)):[6 cdot sqrt{2} - 6 cdot 3 = 6sqrt{2} - 18]Now, adding both results together:[(11 - 6sqrt{2}) + (6sqrt{2} - 18)]Let's combine like terms:- The constants: (11 - 18 = -7)- The (sqrt{2}) terms: (-6sqrt{2} + 6sqrt{2} = 0)So, everything cancels out except for (-7).Wait, that seems too simple. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the beginning:1. Simplified ((2a + sqrt{3})(2a - sqrt{3})) to (4a^2 - 3). That seems correct.2. Expanded (-3a(a - 2)) to (-3a^2 + 6a). That also looks right.3. Combined all terms: (4a^2 - 3 - 3a^2 + 6a + 3). Simplified to (a^2 + 6a). Correct.4. Substituted (a = sqrt{2} - 3) into (a^2 + 6a).5. Expanded ((sqrt{2} - 3)^2) to (2 - 6sqrt{2} + 9 = 11 - 6sqrt{2}). That's right.6. Expanded (6(sqrt{2} - 3)) to (6sqrt{2} - 18). Correct.7. Added both results: (11 - 6sqrt{2} + 6sqrt{2} - 18 = -7). Yes, the (sqrt{2}) terms cancel out, leaving (-7).So, it seems like I did everything correctly. The final result is (-7).Just to be thorough, maybe I can plug the original expression into a calculator with (a = sqrt{2} - 3) and see if it also gives (-7). But since I don't have a calculator handy, I'll try to compute each part numerically.First, compute (a = sqrt{2} - 3). Since (sqrt{2} approx 1.4142), so (a approx 1.4142 - 3 = -1.5858).Now, compute each part of the original expression:1. ((2a + sqrt{3})(2a - sqrt{3})):Compute (2a = 2(-1.5858) = -3.1716).So, (2a + sqrt{3} approx -3.1716 + 1.7320 = -1.4396).(2a - sqrt{3} approx -3.1716 - 1.7320 = -4.9036).Multiply them: (-1.4396 times -4.9036 approx 7.06).2. Compute (-3a(a - 2)):First, (a - 2 = -1.5858 - 2 = -3.5858).Multiply by (a): (-1.5858 times -3.5858 approx 5.68).Multiply by (-3): (-3 times 5.68 approx -17.04).3. Add the constant term: (+3).Now, add all parts together: (7.06 - 17.04 + 3 approx (7.06 - 17.04) + 3 = (-9.98) + 3 = -6.98).Hmm, that's approximately (-7), which matches my earlier result. So, that gives me more confidence that (-7) is the correct answer.Therefore, after simplifying and evaluating, the result is (-7).**Final Answer**boxed{-7}"},{"question":"What is left(frac{7}{8}right)^3 cdot left(frac{7}{8}right)^{-3}?","answer":"Okay, so I have this math problem here: What is (7/8)^3 multiplied by (7/8)^-3? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you multiply exponents with the same base, you can add the exponents together. Is that right? Yeah, I think so. So, if I have something like a^m times a^n, that equals a^(m+n). Alright, so in this case, both terms have the same base, which is 7/8. The first term is (7/8)^3, and the second term is (7/8)^-3. So, if I apply the rule I just remembered, I can add the exponents. That would be 3 + (-3). Let me write that down:(7/8)^3 * (7/8)^-3 = (7/8)^(3 + (-3)).Simplifying the exponent, 3 + (-3) is 0. So, now I have (7/8)^0. Wait, anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, right? Yeah, that's a rule I learned before. So, (7/8)^0 should equal 1. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think about it another way. Maybe I can simplify each term separately and then multiply them. Let's see, (7/8)^3 is 7^3 over 8^3. That would be 343 over 512. And (7/8)^-3 is the same as 1 over (7/8)^3, right? Because a negative exponent means the reciprocal. So, that would be 1 divided by 343/512, which is 512/343.Now, if I multiply 343/512 by 512/343, what do I get? Let me write that out:(343/512) * (512/343).I can see that 343 in the numerator cancels out with 343 in the denominator, and 512 cancels out with 512. So, that leaves me with 1/1, which is just 1. Okay, that confirms my earlier result. So, whether I use the exponent rule or simplify each term separately, I end up with 1. That makes sense because when you multiply a number by its reciprocal, you get 1. In this case, (7/8)^3 is the number, and (7/8)^-3 is its reciprocal. So, their product is 1.Wait, let me just make sure I didn't confuse the rules. Sometimes, exponents can be tricky. So, the rule is a^m * a^n = a^(m+n). So, if m is 3 and n is -3, then m + n is 0. And a^0 is 1, regardless of what a is, as long as a is not zero. Since 7/8 is definitely not zero, that's fine.Another way to think about it is using logarithms, but that might be overcomplicating things. Let me see. If I take the logarithm of (7/8)^3 * (7/8)^-3, that would be log((7/8)^3) + log((7/8)^-3). Using the logarithm power rule, that's 3*log(7/8) + (-3)*log(7/8). Which simplifies to (3 - 3)*log(7/8) = 0*log(7/8) = 0. Then, taking the antilogarithm, 10^0 = 1. So, that also gives me 1. Hmm, that's another method, but it's a bit more involved. I think the first two methods are sufficient. Either way, all approaches lead me to the same answer, which is 1. Just to recap, the problem was (7/8)^3 multiplied by (7/8)^-3. By adding the exponents, I got (7/8)^0, which is 1. Alternatively, simplifying each term and multiplying also gave me 1. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.I wonder if there's a general rule here. If I have any non-zero number a, then a^m * a^-m would always be a^(m - m) = a^0 = 1. So, this is a specific case of that general rule. That's pretty cool because it shows how exponents work together. It's like they cancel each other out when multiplied in this way.Let me test this with another example to make sure I understand it correctly. Suppose I have (2/3)^2 * (2/3)^-2. According to the rule, this should be (2/3)^(2 + (-2)) = (2/3)^0 = 1. Let me check by simplifying each term: (2/3)^2 is 4/9, and (2/3)^-2 is 1/(4/9) = 9/4. Multiplying 4/9 by 9/4 gives 1. Yep, that works too.So, this seems to be a consistent rule. It's useful to remember because it can simplify problems where you have exponents with the same base but opposite signs. Instead of calculating each term separately, you can just recognize that their product is 1.I think I've got a good grasp on this now. The key takeaway is that when multiplying two exponents with the same base, you add their exponents. If the exponents are opposites, like 3 and -3, their sum is zero, and anything to the power of zero is 1. This applies regardless of the base, as long as the base isn't zero because zero to the power of zero is undefined.Another thing to note is that this rule applies to any real number exponents, not just integers. So, even if the exponents were fractions or irrationals, as long as they are additive inverses, their product would still be 1. For example, (5/6)^π * (5/6)^-π would equal 1. That's pretty neat because it shows the beauty of exponent rules in simplifying complex expressions.In summary, the problem (7/8)^3 * (7/8)^-3 simplifies to 1 by applying the exponent addition rule, recognizing that the exponents cancel each other out, resulting in the base raised to the power of zero, which is 1. This concept is fundamental in algebra and is essential for simplifying and solving more complex equations in the future.I think I've thought through this thoroughly and can confidently say that the answer is 1. It's always good to verify with different methods to ensure that the solution is correct, especially when dealing with exponents, which can sometimes be counterintuitive.**Final Answer**The value of left(frac{7}{8}right)^3 cdot left(frac{7}{8}right)^{-3} is boxed{1}."},{"question":"If the equation of circle C_1 is x^2+y^2-4x-4y+7=0, and the equation of circle C_2 is x^2+y^2-4x-10y+13=0, then the number of common tangents to the two circles is     .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of common tangents between two circles, C₁ and C₂. Their equations are given as:C₁: x² + y² - 4x - 4y + 7 = 0C₂: x² + y² - 4x - 10y + 13 = 0Hmm, I remember that to find the number of common tangents, I first need to figure out the positions of these two circles relative to each other. That usually involves finding their centers and radii, and then determining whether they intersect, are separate, or one is inside the other.Let me start by rewriting both equations in the standard form of a circle, which is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.Starting with C₁: x² + y² - 4x - 4y + 7 = 0I need to complete the squares for both x and y terms.For the x terms: x² - 4x. To complete the square, take half of -4, which is -2, square it to get 4. So, x² - 4x becomes (x - 2)² - 4.Similarly, for the y terms: y² - 4y. Half of -4 is -2, square it to get 4. So, y² - 4y becomes (y - 2)² - 4.Now, substituting back into the equation:(x - 2)² - 4 + (y - 2)² - 4 + 7 = 0Simplify the constants:-4 - 4 + 7 = -1So, (x - 2)² + (y - 2)² - 1 = 0Which means (x - 2)² + (y - 2)² = 1So, the center of C₁ is (2, 2) and the radius is √1 = 1.Alright, moving on to C₂: x² + y² - 4x - 10y + 13 = 0Again, I'll complete the squares for x and y.For the x terms: x² - 4x. As before, this becomes (x - 2)² - 4.For the y terms: y² - 10y. Half of -10 is -5, square it to get 25. So, y² - 10y becomes (y - 5)² - 25.Substituting back into the equation:(x - 2)² - 4 + (y - 5)² - 25 + 13 = 0Simplify the constants:-4 - 25 + 13 = -16So, (x - 2)² + (y - 5)² - 16 = 0Which means (x - 2)² + (y - 5)² = 16Therefore, the center of C₂ is (2, 5) and the radius is √16 = 4.Okay, so now I have both circles in standard form:C₁: Center (2, 2), Radius 1C₂: Center (2, 5), Radius 4Next step is to find the distance between the centers of the two circles. Since both centers have the same x-coordinate, 2, they lie on a vertical line. So, the distance between them is just the difference in their y-coordinates.Distance, d = |5 - 2| = 3 units.Now, I need to compare this distance with the sum and difference of the radii to determine the position of the circles relative to each other.Sum of radii, r₁ + r₂ = 1 + 4 = 5Difference of radii, |r₂ - r₁| = |4 - 1| = 3So, the distance between centers is 3, which is equal to the difference of the radii. That means one circle is inside the other, and they are tangent to each other at exactly one point.Wait, hold on. Let me think. If the distance between centers is equal to the difference of radii, then the smaller circle lies inside the larger one and they touch at exactly one point. So, in this case, C₁ is inside C₂, and they are tangent internally.Now, how does this affect the number of common tangents?I remember that:- If two circles are separate (distance between centers > sum of radii), they have 4 common tangents: 2 direct and 2 transverse.- If they touch externally (distance = sum of radii), they have 3 common tangents: 2 direct and 1 common tangent at the point of contact.- If they intersect at two points (difference of radii < distance < sum of radii), they have 2 common tangents.- If one circle is inside the other without touching (distance + smaller radius < larger radius), they have no common tangents.- If they are tangent internally (distance = difference of radii), they have 1 common tangent at the point of contact.Wait, so in this case, since the distance between centers is equal to the difference of the radii, they are internally tangent, so they have exactly 1 common tangent.But hold on, let me double-check because sometimes I get confused between internal and external tangents.So, when two circles are externally tangent, they touch at one point, and have three common tangents: two external ones and one at the point of contact.When they are internally tangent, they also touch at one point, but in this case, the smaller circle is inside the larger one, so the only common tangent is at the point where they touch. There are no external or internal tangents because the smaller circle is entirely within the larger one except for that single point.Therefore, in this case, since the distance between centers is equal to the difference of radii, the circles are internally tangent, and they have exactly one common tangent.Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes I might have mixed up the number of tangents. Let me think again.If two circles are separate, four tangents: two direct (external) and two transverse (internal). If they touch externally, the two transverse tangents coincide at the point of contact, so total three. If they intersect at two points, only two common tangents. If one is inside the other without touching, no common tangents. If they are tangent internally, only one common tangent.Yes, that seems right. So, in our case, since the distance between centers is equal to the difference of radii, they are internally tangent, so only one common tangent.But wait, let me compute the distance again to make sure.Centers are (2,2) and (2,5). So, vertical distance is 3 units. The radii are 1 and 4. So, 4 - 1 = 3. So, yes, the distance between centers is equal to the difference of radii, so they are internally tangent.Therefore, number of common tangents is 1.But wait, hold on. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because sometimes, depending on the position, even if one is inside the other, if they are tangent, there is exactly one common tangent. But if they are separate, not touching, then no common tangents. If they intersect, two common tangents. If externally tangent, three, and internally tangent, one.So, in this case, since they are internally tangent, only one common tangent.But wait, I just want to visualize this. Imagine a small circle inside a larger one, touching at exactly one point. So, at that point, there is only one tangent line that touches both circles. There are no other lines that can touch both circles without crossing through the larger circle.So, yes, only one common tangent.Therefore, the number of common tangents is 1.Wait, but hold on, I think I might have confused something. Because sometimes, even if one circle is inside another, if they are not tangent, there are no common tangents. But if they are tangent, then only one.So, in this case, since they are tangent internally, only one common tangent.But let me cross-verify this with another approach.Another way to find the number of common tangents is to compute the distance between centers and compare it with the sum and difference of radii.Given:d = distance between centers = 3r₁ = 1, r₂ = 4If d > r₁ + r₂: 4 common tangents.If d = r₁ + r₂: 3 common tangents.If |r₂ - r₁| < d < r₁ + r₂: 2 common tangents.If d = |r₂ - r₁|: 1 common tangent.If d < |r₂ - r₁|: 0 common tangents.So, in our case, d = 3, |r₂ - r₁| = 3, so d = |r₂ - r₁|, so it's the case of internal tangency, leading to 1 common tangent.Therefore, the number of common tangents is 1.But wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier because I thought of the case when d = |r₂ - r₁| as internal tangent, but actually, when d = |r₂ - r₁|, the circles are tangent internally, so only one tangent.But let me think again. If the distance between centers is equal to the difference of radii, then one circle is inside the other, touching at exactly one point. So, in this case, yes, only one common tangent.So, the answer should be 1.Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in problems, when circles are tangent, whether internally or externally, they have three or one tangent respectively.Wait, no, actually, when circles are externally tangent, they have three common tangents: two external and one at the point of contact. When internally tangent, they have only one common tangent at the point of contact.So, yes, in this case, since they are internally tangent, only one common tangent.Therefore, the number of common tangents is 1.Wait, but I just want to make sure. Let me think about the equations again.C₁: (x - 2)² + (y - 2)² = 1C₂: (x - 2)² + (y - 5)² = 16So, centers at (2,2) and (2,5), distance between centers is 3. C₁ has radius 1, C₂ has radius 4. So, the distance between centers is exactly equal to the difference of radii (4 - 1 = 3). So, C₁ is inside C₂, touching at one point.So, the point of contact would be along the line connecting the centers, which is vertical in this case. So, moving from (2,2) upwards towards (2,5), the point of contact is at (2,2 + 1) = (2,3), because C₁ has radius 1. Similarly, from C₂'s perspective, moving down from (2,5) by radius 4 would reach (2,1), but since C₁ is only radius 1, the point of contact is (2,3). Wait, that doesn't add up.Wait, hold on. Let me compute the point of contact.Since C₁ is centered at (2,2) with radius 1, and C₂ is centered at (2,5) with radius 4. The distance between centers is 3, which is equal to 4 - 1. So, the point of contact lies along the line connecting the centers, which is vertical.Starting from the center of C₁, (2,2), moving towards the center of C₂, (2,5), a distance equal to the radius of C₁, which is 1. So, the point of contact is (2,2 + 1) = (2,3).Similarly, starting from the center of C₂, (2,5), moving towards C₁, a distance equal to the radius of C₂ minus the distance between centers? Wait, no.Wait, the point of contact is located at a distance of r₁ from C₁ and r₂ from C₂, but since they are internally tangent, the point is located r₁ away from C₁ towards C₂, which is (2,3). So, yes, (2,3) is the point where they touch.Therefore, the only common tangent is the tangent at (2,3). So, how many common tangents are there? Just one.Hence, the number of common tangents is 1.Wait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes I might have thought that even if one circle is inside another, there could be two common tangents, but no, in the case of internal tangency, it's only one.So, yes, I think the answer is 1.**Final Answer**The number of common tangents to the two circles is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Using only a compass, construct three points that lie on a single straight line.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to construct three points that lie on a single straight line using only a compass. Hmm, interesting. I remember that with just a compass, you can do a lot of constructions, but I'm not entirely sure how to approach this specific one. Let me think through it step by step.First off, I know that a straight line can be constructed with a compass and straightedge, but here I only have a compass. So, I need to figure out a way to create three colinear points without using a straightedge. That might be a bit tricky, but maybe I can use some geometric principles to help me out.I recall that if I can construct two points, I can then use the compass to find a third point that lies on the same line. But how exactly? Maybe I can use the concept of circles and their intersections. If I can create two circles that intersect at two points, those points can define a line, and then I can find a third point on that line using the compass.Let me try to visualize this. Suppose I start by drawing a circle with any radius, centered at point A. Then, I choose another point B on the circumference of this circle. Now, if I draw another circle with the same radius centered at point B, it should intersect the first circle at two points. Let's call these intersection points C and D. So, points C and D lie on both circles, meaning they are equidistant from both A and B. Therefore, the line CD is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB.Wait, but I need three points on a single straight line, not necessarily the perpendicular bisector. Hmm, maybe I can use this perpendicular bisector to help me find another point. If I can find another point on line CD, then I can have three points: C, the midpoint of AB, and D. But hold on, I don't have a straightedge, so how can I ensure that these points are colinear?Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of congruent circles. If I construct two circles with the same radius, their centers and the intersection points can form an equilateral triangle. But again, I'm not sure how that helps me get three colinear points.Let me think differently. If I can construct two points, A and B, and then use the compass to find a third point C such that C lies on the line AB. But without a straightedge, how can I ensure that C is on AB? Maybe by using the concept of transferring distances.Here's an idea: I can use the compass to measure the distance between A and B, then mark off another point C at the same distance from B. That way, points A, B, and C would be colinear, each separated by the same distance. But wait, does this work without a straightedge?Let me break it down. Suppose I have points A and B. I set the compass to the distance AB. Then, with the compass point at B, I draw an arc. The intersection of this arc with the previous circle (if any) would give me point C. But hold on, if I only have points A and B, how do I ensure that the arc intersects in such a way that C is colinear with A and B?Maybe I need to create a series of circles that intersect in a way that forces the third point to lie on the same line. Let me try constructing circles centered at A and B with radius AB. These two circles intersect at two points, say C and D. Now, points C and D are both equidistant from A and B, so line CD is the perpendicular bisector of AB. But I need points on AB, not on its perpendicular bisector.Hmm, perhaps I can use the intersection points to help me find another point on AB. If I connect C and D, that's the perpendicular bisector, but I need something else. Maybe if I construct another circle centered at C with radius CA, it will intersect the original circles at some points. But I'm not sure if that helps me get a third point on AB.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. If I have points A and B, and I construct a circle centered at A with radius AB, and another circle centered at B with radius BA, their intersections are C and D. Now, if I construct a circle centered at C with radius CA, it should pass through A and B. Similarly, a circle centered at D with radius DA would also pass through A and B. But how does that help me get a third point on AB?Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of extending a line. If I have points A and B, I can use the compass to find a point C such that AC = AB. But without a straightedge, how do I ensure that C is on the line AB? I think this is where the concept of transferring distances comes into play.Here's a method I remember: to extend a line beyond a point using only a compass. Let's say I have points A and B. I can construct a circle centered at B with radius BA, which intersects the original circle at some point, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, if I have points A and B, and I want to find a point C such that AC = AB, I can do the following:1. Draw a circle centered at A with radius AB; let's call this circle C1.2. Draw a circle centered at B with radius BA; this is the same as circle C1, so it doesn't help.3. Alternatively, draw a circle centered at B with radius BA, which is the same as circle C1, so again, not helpful.Wait, maybe I need to use a different radius. Let me think. If I set the compass to a different radius, say, twice the length of AB, I can mark off another point. But without a straightedge, how do I ensure that it's colinear?Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles or something. If I can create two congruent triangles, their corresponding sides might help me find a colinear point.Wait, here's another idea. If I have points A and B, I can construct a circle centered at A with radius AB, and another circle centered at B with radius AB. These intersect at points C and D. Now, if I construct a circle centered at C with radius CA, it will pass through A and B. Similarly, a circle centered at D with radius DA will also pass through A and B. Now, if I construct a circle centered at C with radius CB, it will intersect the circle centered at D somewhere. Maybe that intersection point can help me find another colinear point.But this seems too convoluted. Maybe I need a simpler approach. Let me recall that with only a compass, you can perform all the constructions that a straightedge and compass can do, but it's more involved. So, perhaps I can use the compass to transfer distances and create parallel lines or something like that.Wait, another thought: if I can construct two circles that intersect at two points, and then use those intersection points to help me find a third point on the original line. For example, if I have points A and B, and I construct circles centered at A and B with radius AB, getting points C and D. Then, if I construct a circle centered at C with radius CA, it will pass through A and B. Similarly, a circle centered at D with radius DA will pass through A and B. Now, if I construct a circle centered at C with radius CB, it will intersect the circle centered at D at some point E. Maybe E lies on AB?Wait, let me try to visualize this. Points C and D are above and below the line AB. If I draw a circle centered at C with radius CB, which is equal to AB, and another circle centered at D with radius DB, which is also equal to AB, their intersection points would be somewhere. But I'm not sure if those points lie on AB.Alternatively, maybe if I construct circles centered at C and D with radius CA, which is equal to AB, they will intersect at points A and B. But that doesn't help me get a third point on AB.Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Instead of trying to extend AB, maybe I can construct three points from scratch that are colinear. Let's say I start by drawing a circle with center A. Then, I choose a point B on the circumference. Then, I draw another circle centered at B with the same radius, intersecting the first circle at C and D. Now, I have points A, B, C, D. If I connect C and D, that's the perpendicular bisector. But I need points on AB.Wait, perhaps if I construct a circle centered at C with radius CA, it will pass through A and B. Similarly, a circle centered at D with radius DA will pass through A and B. Now, if I construct another circle centered at C with radius CB, which is equal to AB, it will intersect the circle centered at D at some point E. Maybe E is colinear with A and B?Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of midpoints. If I can find the midpoint of AB using only a compass, then I can have three points: A, midpoint M, and B. But how do I find the midpoint with only a compass?I remember that to find the midpoint with a compass, you can construct two circles: one centered at A with radius AB, and another centered at B with radius BA. Their intersection points are C and D. Then, the line CD is the perpendicular bisector, and its intersection with AB is the midpoint M. But again, without a straightedge, how do I draw line CD or find the intersection point M?Wait, maybe I can use the intersection points C and D to help me find M. If I construct circles centered at C and D with radius CA, they both pass through A and B. Now, if I construct a circle centered at C with radius CB, it will intersect the circle centered at D at some point. Maybe that point is M?Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles. If I can create two congruent triangles, their corresponding sides might help me find a colinear point.Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. I need three points on a straight line. Maybe I can start by constructing two points, A and B, then use the compass to find a third point C such that C is on the line AB.To do this, I can use the concept of transferring distances. Here's how:1. Draw a circle centered at A with radius AB; let's call this circle C1.2. Draw a circle centered at B with radius BA; this is the same as circle C1, so it doesn't help.3. Alternatively, draw a circle centered at B with radius AB; let's call this circle C2.4. The intersection points of C1 and C2 are C and D, which are the two points forming an equilateral triangle with A and B.5. Now, if I draw a circle centered at C with radius CA, it will pass through A and B.6. Similarly, a circle centered at D with radius DA will pass through A and B.7. Now, if I draw a circle centered at C with radius CB, which is equal to AB, it will intersect circle C2 at some point E.8. Similarly, a circle centered at D with radius DB will intersect circle C2 at the same point E.9. Therefore, point E is colinear with A and B.Wait, does that work? Let me check. If I have points A, B, C, D forming an equilateral triangle, then circles centered at C and D with radius CB and DB respectively will intersect at E, which should lie on the extension of AB beyond B. Therefore, points A, B, and E are colinear, with E being a third point on the line AB.But wait, does this construction actually result in E being colinear with A and B? Let me think geometrically. If I have an equilateral triangle ABC, then point C is above AB, and point D is below AB. If I draw a circle centered at C with radius CB, it will intersect the circle centered at B with radius AB at a point E beyond B. Similarly, the circle centered at D with radius DB will also intersect the circle centered at B at the same point E. Therefore, E is indeed colinear with A and B, lying on the extension of AB beyond B.So, to summarize, the steps are:1. Draw circle C1 centered at A with radius AB.2. Draw circle C2 centered at B with radius AB; let them intersect at points C and D.3. Draw circle C3 centered at C with radius CB.4. Draw circle C4 centered at D with radius DB.5. The intersection point E of circles C3 and C4 lies on the line AB extended beyond B.6. Therefore, points A, B, and E are colinear.Alternatively, if I want a point between A and B, I can use a similar method to find the midpoint M. But since the problem doesn't specify where the third point should be, just that it should lie on the same line, E is a valid third point.Wait, but in this construction, I used points C and D to help me find E. So, I started with A and B, constructed C and D, then used them to find E. Therefore, I have three points: A, B, and E, all lying on the same straight line.Alternatively, if I want three points in a row, like A, M, B, where M is the midpoint, I can use a similar approach. Let me try that.1. Draw circle C1 centered at A with radius AB.2. Draw circle C2 centered at B with radius AB; let them intersect at points C and D.3. Draw circle C3 centered at C with radius CA.4. Draw circle C4 centered at D with radius DA.5. The intersection of circles C3 and C4 is the midpoint M of AB.6. Therefore, points A, M, and B are colinear.But wait, without a straightedge, how do I ensure that M lies on AB? Because the intersection of C3 and C4 is actually two points: M and another point. But since M is the midpoint, it lies on AB, while the other intersection point is the reflection of M over AB, which is not on AB.Wait, no, actually, circles C3 and C4 are both centered at C and D with radius CA and DA respectively, which are equal to AB. Therefore, their intersection points are M and another point. But since M is the midpoint, it lies on AB, while the other point is the other intersection point, which is not on AB.Therefore, by constructing circles C3 and C4, I can find the midpoint M, which is colinear with A and B. So, points A, M, and B are colinear.But in this case, I only have three points: A, M, and B. So, that satisfies the problem's requirement of constructing three points on a single straight line using only a compass.Wait, but the problem says \\"construct three points,\\" so maybe I can just construct A, B, and M, or A, B, and E, depending on whether I want the midpoint or an extension.Alternatively, maybe I can construct three arbitrary points on a line without starting with two points. Let me think about that.Suppose I start by drawing any circle with center A. Then, choose a point B on the circumference. Then, construct point C such that AC = AB, but on the opposite side. But without a straightedge, how do I ensure that C is on the line AB?Wait, maybe I can use the same method as before. If I construct circles centered at A and B with radius AB, getting points C and D. Then, using those points, I can find E as the extension beyond B, or M as the midpoint.Therefore, regardless of the approach, the key is to use the intersection points of circles to find a third colinear point.So, to answer the original question, here's a step-by-step method:1. Draw a circle centered at point A with radius AB; let's call this circle C1.2. Draw a circle centered at point B with radius BA; let's call this circle C2.3. Let C1 and C2 intersect at points C and D.4. Draw a circle centered at point C with radius CB; let's call this circle C3.5. Draw a circle centered at point D with radius DB; let's call this circle C4.6. Let C3 and C4 intersect at point E.7. Point E lies on the line AB extended beyond B.8. Therefore, points A, B, and E are colinear.Alternatively, to find the midpoint M:1. Draw circle C1 centered at A with radius AB.2. Draw circle C2 centered at B with radius AB; let them intersect at points C and D.3. Draw circle C3 centered at C with radius CA.4. Draw circle C4 centered at D with radius DA.5. Let C3 and C4 intersect at point M.6. Point M is the midpoint of AB and lies on the line AB.7. Therefore, points A, M, and B are colinear.So, depending on whether I want the midpoint or an extension, I can choose the appropriate construction. Both methods use only a compass and result in three colinear points.Wait, but in the first method, I used points C and D to find E, which is beyond B. In the second method, I used points C and D to find M, the midpoint. So, both constructions are valid and result in three colinear points.Therefore, the answer is that by constructing two circles with radius AB centered at A and B, finding their intersections C and D, then using those points to construct circles that intersect at a third point E or M, which lies on the line AB, we can obtain three colinear points.So, to wrap it up, the three points can be constructed by first creating two circles to find intersection points, then using those to find a third point on the original line. This method relies solely on the compass and ensures that all three points lie on a single straight line."},{"question":"If the slope angle of the line (a-2)x-y+3=0 is 45°, then the value of the real number a is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"If the slope angle of the line ((a-2)x - y + 3 = 0) is 45°, then the value of the real number (a) is ______.\\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the slope angle of a line is the angle that the line makes with the positive direction of the x-axis, measured counterclockwise. So, if the slope angle is 45°, that means the line is rising at a 45° angle from the x-axis. I also recall that the slope of a line is equal to the tangent of its angle of inclination. So, if the angle is 45°, the slope should be (tan(45°)).Wait, what's (tan(45°))? I think it's 1 because (tan(45°) = frac{sin(45°)}{cos(45°)} = frac{sqrt{2}/2}{sqrt{2}/2} = 1). Yeah, that's right. So, the slope of the line is 1.Now, the equation given is ((a - 2)x - y + 3 = 0). I need to find the slope of this line and set it equal to 1, then solve for (a). To find the slope, I should probably rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, which is (y = mx + b), where (m) is the slope and (b) is the y-intercept.Let me rearrange the equation:Starting with ((a - 2)x - y + 3 = 0).I can move the (y) term to the other side:((a - 2)x + 3 = y).So, that simplifies to (y = (a - 2)x + 3). Great, so now it's in the form (y = mx + b), where (m = (a - 2)). Therefore, the slope (m) is (a - 2).But we already determined that the slope should be 1 because the angle is 45°. So, I can set up the equation:(a - 2 = 1).Now, solving for (a):Add 2 to both sides:(a = 1 + 2)(a = 3).Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. The given equation is ((a - 2)x - y + 3 = 0).2. I rearranged it to (y = (a - 2)x + 3), which is correct.3. The slope (m) is (a - 2).4. Since the slope angle is 45°, the slope (m = tan(45°) = 1).5. So, (a - 2 = 1) leads to (a = 3).Hmm, that all seems to check out. I don't think I made any errors here. The key was recognizing that the slope is the tangent of the angle, and then converting the given equation into slope-intercept form to find the slope in terms of (a).Just to be thorough, let me plug (a = 3) back into the original equation and see if the slope is indeed 1.Original equation: ((3 - 2)x - y + 3 = 0).Simplify: (1x - y + 3 = 0), which is (x - y + 3 = 0).Rearranged: (y = x + 3).Yes, that has a slope of 1, which corresponds to a 45° angle. Perfect, that confirms that (a = 3) is the correct answer.I think I'm confident with this solution. It was a bit of a straightforward problem, but it's always good to verify each step to avoid any mistakes. I remember sometimes when dealing with angles and slopes, it's easy to confuse the angle with the arctangent or something, but in this case, it was pretty direct since 45° is a common angle with a known tangent value.So, in summary, the steps were:1. Recognize that the slope is the tangent of the given angle.2. Convert the given equation into slope-intercept form to find the slope in terms of (a).3. Set the slope equal to 1 and solve for (a).4. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation.This method worked well, and I didn't encounter any roadblocks or confusing parts. It's always reassuring when the steps are clear and the answer checks out when substituted back into the original problem.Another thing I could consider is whether there are any alternative methods to solve this problem, just to see if they lead to the same answer. For example, maybe using the concept of direction vectors or something else.Wait, the direction vector of a line with slope (m) is ((1, m)). Since the slope is 1, the direction vector would be ((1, 1)). The original line equation is ((a - 2)x - y + 3 = 0), which can be written as ((a - 2)x - y = -3). The coefficients of (x) and (y) give the normal vector of the line, which is ((a - 2, -1)). The direction vector should be perpendicular to the normal vector. So, their dot product should be zero.Let me compute the dot product of the direction vector ((1, 1)) and the normal vector ((a - 2, -1)):(1*(a - 2) + 1*(-1) = (a - 2) - 1 = a - 3).Since they are perpendicular, the dot product should be zero:(a - 3 = 0).Therefore, (a = 3).Oh, that's another way to get the same result. That's interesting. So, using the direction vector and normal vector approach also leads to (a = 3). That reinforces that the answer is correct.I guess this problem can be approached in multiple ways, which is a good learning experience. It shows how different concepts in math are interconnected. Understanding the relationship between the normal vector and direction vector is another layer that can be used to solve the problem, and it's satisfying to see that both methods lead to the same answer.I think I'm pretty solid on this now. It's always good to understand a problem from different angles, so to speak. It helps in case one method isn't clear or if I forget a particular formula; I can rely on another approach to reach the solution.In conclusion, whether I use the slope-intercept form or the vector approach, I consistently arrive at (a = 3). This thoroughness gives me confidence that my answer is correct.**Final Answer**The value of (a) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"In a geometric sequence {a_{n}} where all terms are positive numbers, if a_{2}a_{6}+a_{5}a_{11}=16, then the maximum value of a_{4}a_{8} is ( )A: 4B: 8C: 16D: 32","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence where all terms are positive. The problem says that ( a_2 a_6 + a_5 a_{11} = 16 ), and I need to find the maximum value of ( a_4 a_8 ). The options are A: 4, B: 8, C: 16, D: 32.First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as ( r ). So, the general form is ( a_n = a_1 times r^{n-1} ), where ( a_1 ) is the first term.Given that all terms are positive, that means both ( a_1 ) and ( r ) are positive numbers. That's good to know because it might affect the application of certain inequalities or properties later on.Now, let's write down the given equation: ( a_2 a_6 + a_5 a_{11} = 16 ). Let me express each term using the general formula.Starting with ( a_2 ):( a_2 = a_1 times r^{2-1} = a_1 r )Similarly, ( a_6 = a_1 r^{6-1} = a_1 r^5 )So, ( a_2 a_6 = (a_1 r)(a_1 r^5) = a_1^2 r^6 )Next, ( a_5 = a_1 r^{5-1} = a_1 r^4 )And ( a_{11} = a_1 r^{11-1} = a_1 r^{10} )Therefore, ( a_5 a_{11} = (a_1 r^4)(a_1 r^{10}) = a_1^2 r^{14} )Putting it all together, the given equation becomes:( a_1^2 r^6 + a_1^2 r^{14} = 16 )I can factor out ( a_1^2 r^6 ) from both terms:( a_1^2 r^6 (1 + r^8) = 16 )Okay, so that's one equation. Now, I need to find the maximum value of ( a_4 a_8 ).Let me express ( a_4 ) and ( a_8 ) similarly.( a_4 = a_1 r^{4-1} = a_1 r^3 )( a_8 = a_1 r^{8-1} = a_1 r^7 )So, ( a_4 a_8 = (a_1 r^3)(a_1 r^7) = a_1^2 r^{10} )So, we need to maximize ( a_1^2 r^{10} ) given that ( a_1^2 r^6 (1 + r^8) = 16 ).Hmm, so let me denote ( x = r^2 ) to simplify the expressions. Since ( r ) is positive, ( x ) will also be positive.Let me substitute ( r^2 = x ). Then, ( r^6 = (r^2)^3 = x^3 ), ( r^{10} = (r^2)^5 = x^5 ), and ( r^8 = (r^2)^4 = x^4 ).So, substituting into the equation:( a_1^2 x^3 (1 + x^4) = 16 )And the expression we need to maximize is ( a_1^2 x^5 ).Let me denote ( y = a_1^2 x^5 ). So, we need to find the maximum value of ( y ).From the equation above, ( a_1^2 x^3 (1 + x^4) = 16 ), we can express ( a_1^2 x^5 ) in terms of this.Let me see:We have ( a_1^2 x^3 (1 + x^4) = 16 )Let me solve for ( a_1^2 ):( a_1^2 = frac{16}{x^3 (1 + x^4)} )Then, ( y = a_1^2 x^5 = frac{16}{x^3 (1 + x^4)} times x^5 = frac{16 x^2}{1 + x^4} )So, now, the problem reduces to maximizing ( y = frac{16 x^2}{1 + x^4} ) where ( x > 0 ).So, to find the maximum value of ( y ), we can treat it as a calculus problem. Let me consider ( y ) as a function of ( x ):( y(x) = frac{16 x^2}{1 + x^4} )To find its maximum, I can take the derivative of ( y ) with respect to ( x ), set it equal to zero, and solve for ( x ).Let me compute ( y'(x) ):First, write ( y(x) = 16 x^2 (1 + x^4)^{-1} )Using the quotient rule or product rule. Let's use the product rule:Let ( u = 16 x^2 ) and ( v = (1 + x^4)^{-1} )Then, ( y = u v ), so ( y' = u' v + u v' )Compute ( u' = 32 x )Compute ( v' = -1 times (1 + x^4)^{-2} times 4 x^3 = -4 x^3 (1 + x^4)^{-2} )So, putting it all together:( y' = 32 x (1 + x^4)^{-1} + 16 x^2 (-4 x^3) (1 + x^4)^{-2} )Simplify each term:First term: ( 32 x / (1 + x^4) )Second term: ( -64 x^5 / (1 + x^4)^2 )So, ( y' = frac{32 x}{1 + x^4} - frac{64 x^5}{(1 + x^4)^2} )To combine these terms, let's get a common denominator:( y' = frac{32 x (1 + x^4) - 64 x^5}{(1 + x^4)^2} )Expand the numerator:( 32 x (1 + x^4) = 32 x + 32 x^5 )So, numerator becomes:( 32 x + 32 x^5 - 64 x^5 = 32 x - 32 x^5 )Factor out 32 x:( 32 x (1 - x^4) )So, ( y' = frac{32 x (1 - x^4)}{(1 + x^4)^2} )Set ( y' = 0 ):( frac{32 x (1 - x^4)}{(1 + x^4)^2} = 0 )The denominator is always positive since ( x > 0 ), so we can ignore it for setting the equation to zero.So, ( 32 x (1 - x^4) = 0 )Since ( x > 0 ), ( 32 x ) is never zero, so we have:( 1 - x^4 = 0 )Thus, ( x^4 = 1 )Since ( x > 0 ), ( x = 1 )So, the critical point is at ( x = 1 ). Now, we need to check if this is a maximum.We can do the second derivative test or analyze the sign of the first derivative around ( x = 1 ).Alternatively, since the function ( y(x) ) tends to zero as ( x ) approaches 0 and as ( x ) approaches infinity, the critical point at ( x = 1 ) is likely a maximum.Let me compute ( y(1) ):( y(1) = frac{16 (1)^2}{1 + (1)^4} = frac{16}{2} = 8 )So, the maximum value of ( y ) is 8.Therefore, the maximum value of ( a_4 a_8 ) is 8.Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.So, when ( x = 1 ), which is ( r^2 = 1 ), so ( r = 1 ), since ( r > 0 ).If ( r = 1 ), the geometric sequence is constant, so all terms are equal to ( a_1 ).Let me verify the original equation:( a_2 a_6 + a_5 a_{11} = a_1 times a_1 + a_1 times a_1 = 2 a_1^2 = 16 )Thus, ( a_1^2 = 8 ), so ( a_1 = sqrt{8} = 2 sqrt{2} )Then, ( a_4 a_8 = a_1 times a_1 = a_1^2 = 8 )So, that's consistent.But wait, is this the only critical point? Let me see.Looking back at the derivative ( y' = frac{32 x (1 - x^4)}{(1 + x^4)^2} )So, for ( x < 1 ), say ( x = 0.5 ), ( 1 - x^4 ) is positive, so ( y' > 0 ). So, the function is increasing.For ( x > 1 ), say ( x = 2 ), ( 1 - x^4 ) is negative, so ( y' < 0 ). So, the function is decreasing.Therefore, the function increases up to ( x = 1 ) and then decreases after that. So, ( x = 1 ) is indeed the point of maximum.Therefore, the maximum value of ( a_4 a_8 ) is 8, which is option B.Wait, but hold on, let me think if there's another way without calculus, maybe using AM-GM inequality.Given that ( a_2 a_6 + a_5 a_{11} = 16 ), and we need to maximize ( a_4 a_8 ).Expressed in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( r ), as before, ( a_2 a_6 = a_1^2 r^6 ) and ( a_5 a_{11} = a_1^2 r^{14} ). So, ( a_1^2 r^6 (1 + r^8) = 16 ).We need to maximize ( a_4 a_8 = a_1^2 r^{10} ).Let me denote ( t = r^4 ). Then, ( r^6 = r^{4 + 2} = t times r^2 ), and ( r^{10} = r^{4 times 2 + 2} = t^2 times r^2 ). Hmm, maybe this substitution complicates things.Alternatively, let me consider the expression ( a_1^2 r^6 (1 + r^8) = 16 ).Let me denote ( u = r^4 ), so ( r^6 = r^{4 + 2} = u r^2 ), and ( r^8 = u^2 ).Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps set ( s = r^2 ), so ( r^6 = s^3 ), ( r^8 = s^4 ), ( r^{10} = s^5 ). So, similar to before.So, ( a_1^2 s^3 (1 + s^4) = 16 ), and we need to maximize ( a_1^2 s^5 ).Express ( a_1^2 s^5 = frac{16 s^2}{1 + s^4} ), as before.So, the problem reduces to maximizing ( frac{16 s^2}{1 + s^4} ).Let me denote ( f(s) = frac{s^2}{1 + s^4} ), so we need to maximize ( 16 f(s) ).To maximize ( f(s) ), perhaps we can use AM-GM inequality.Note that ( s^4 + 1 geq 2 s^2 ) by AM-GM, since ( frac{s^4 + 1}{2} geq sqrt{s^4 times 1} = s^2 ).Therefore, ( 1 + s^4 geq 2 s^2 ), which implies ( frac{s^2}{1 + s^4} leq frac{s^2}{2 s^2} = frac{1}{2} ).So, ( f(s) leq frac{1}{2} ), so ( 16 f(s) leq 8 ). So, the maximum value is 8, achieved when ( s^4 = 1 ), i.e., ( s = 1 ), since ( s > 0 ).Therefore, the maximum value is indeed 8.So, that's another way to see it without calculus, using AM-GM inequality.So, both methods lead to the conclusion that the maximum value of ( a_4 a_8 ) is 8.Therefore, the correct answer is B: 8.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Last week, a farmer shipped 10 boxes of pomelos which had 240 pomelos in all.

How many dozens of pomelos did the farmer ship in all?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of pomelos shipped by the farmer.Last week, the farmer shipped 10 boxes with a total of 240 pomelos. This means each box contains 24 pomelos because 240 divided by 10 is 24.This week, the farmer shipped 20 boxes. Since each box contains 24 pomelos, the total number of pomelos shipped this week is 20 multiplied by 24, which equals 480 pomelos.Adding the pomelos from both weeks, the total number of pomelos shipped is 240 plus 480, resulting in 720 pomelos.To find out how many dozens of pomelos were shipped in total, I divide the total number of pomelos by 12, since one dozen equals 12 pomelos. Therefore, 720 divided by 12 equals 60 dozens."},{"question":"Given that the variance of the data x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} is {s}_{1}^{2}, and the variance of the data 3x_{1}-1, 3x_{2}-1, ldots, 3x_{n}-1 is {s}_{2}^{2}, find frac{{s_2^2}}{{s_1^2}}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about variance. Let me read it again: The variance of the data x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ is s₁². Then, the variance of the data 3x₁ - 1, 3x₂ - 1, ..., 3xₙ - 1 is s₂². I need to find the ratio s₂² / s₁². Hmm, alright.I remember that variance is a measure of how spread out the data is. It's calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. So, if we have a dataset, we first find the mean, then subtract the mean from each data point, square those differences, and take the average. That gives us the variance.Now, in this problem, we have two datasets. The first one is the original data: x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ. The second one is each data point multiplied by 3 and then subtracting 1: 3x₁ - 1, 3x₂ - 1, ..., 3xₙ - 1. I need to find how the variance changes when we apply this transformation.I think there's a property of variance that tells us how it changes when we scale and shift the data. Let me recall. If we have a dataset and we multiply each data point by a constant, say 'a', then the variance gets multiplied by a squared. And if we add a constant, say 'b', to each data point, the variance remains the same because adding a constant just shifts all the data points by the same amount, which doesn't affect the spread.So, in mathematical terms, Var(aX + b) = a² Var(X). That seems right. So, in our case, the transformation is 3x - 1. So, 'a' is 3 and 'b' is -1. Therefore, the variance of the transformed data should be 3 squared times the original variance, which is 9 times s₁². So, s₂² should be 9s₁².Therefore, the ratio s₂² / s₁² would be 9s₁² / s₁², which simplifies to 9. So, the ratio is 9.Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Maybe I should write it out more formally.Let me denote the original data as X = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ} with variance s₁². The transformed data is Y = {3x₁ - 1, 3x₂ - 1, ..., 3xₙ - 1}.To find Var(Y), we can use the formula for variance:Var(Y) = E[(Y - E[Y])²]First, let's find E[Y]. E[Y] = E[3X - 1] = 3E[X] - 1. So, the mean of Y is 3 times the mean of X minus 1.Now, when we calculate Var(Y), it's E[(Y - E[Y])²] = E[((3X - 1) - (3E[X] - 1))²] = E[(3X - 1 - 3E[X] + 1)²] = E[(3X - 3E[X])²] = E[3²(X - E[X])²] = 9E[(X - E[X])²] = 9 Var(X).So, Var(Y) = 9 Var(X). Therefore, s₂² = 9s₁², so s₂² / s₁² = 9.Yeah, that seems consistent. So, the ratio is 9.I guess another way to think about it is that scaling each data point by a factor affects the spread quadratically because variance is based on squared deviations. So, multiplying each point by 3 stretches the data out three times as far from the mean, so the squared deviations become nine times larger. Subtracting 1 just shifts everything down, but it doesn't change how spread out the data is, so the variance remains unaffected by that part.Let me also consider an example to verify. Suppose we have a simple dataset, like X = {1, 2, 3}. The mean is 2, and the variance is [(1-2)² + (2-2)² + (3-2)²]/3 = (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 2/3. So, s₁² = 2/3.Now, applying the transformation Y = 3X - 1, we get Y = {3*1 - 1, 3*2 - 1, 3*3 - 1} = {2, 5, 8}. The mean of Y is (2 + 5 + 8)/3 = 15/3 = 5. The variance is [(2-5)² + (5-5)² + (8-5)²]/3 = (9 + 0 + 9)/3 = 18/3 = 6.So, s₂² = 6, and s₁² = 2/3. Therefore, s₂² / s₁² = 6 / (2/3) = 6 * (3/2) = 9. Yep, that checks out.Another example: X = {0, 0, 0}. The variance is 0 because all points are the same. Then Y = {3*0 -1, 3*0 -1, 3*0 -1} = {-1, -1, -1}, which also has variance 0. So, 0 / 0 is undefined, but in this case, both variances are zero, so the ratio is undefined. But in the problem, we can assume that the original variance is not zero, so we don't have to worry about division by zero.Wait, actually, if s₁² is zero, then all the data points are the same, so after transformation, they're still the same, so s₂² is also zero. So, the ratio is 0/0, which is indeterminate. But in the problem statement, they probably assume that the variance is non-zero, so we can safely say the ratio is 9.Let me think if there's any other way this could go wrong. Suppose we have negative numbers or something? Let's try X = {-1, 0, 1}. The mean is 0. Variance is [(-1 - 0)² + (0 - 0)² + (1 - 0)²]/3 = (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 2/3.Transformed Y = {3*(-1) -1, 3*0 -1, 3*1 -1} = {-4, -1, 2}. The mean is (-4 + (-1) + 2)/3 = (-3)/3 = -1. Variance is [(-4 - (-1))² + (-1 - (-1))² + (2 - (-1))²]/3 = [(-3)² + 0² + (3)²]/3 = (9 + 0 + 9)/3 = 18/3 = 6. Again, s₂² / s₁² = 6 / (2/3) = 9. So, same result.Alright, so it seems consistent across different datasets. So, I think the answer is 9.**Final Answer**The ratio of the variances is boxed{9}."},{"question":"The length of a rectangle is three times its width. Given that its perimeter and area are both numerically equal to ( k > 0 ), find ( k ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle where the length is three times its width. Both the perimeter and the area are equal to the same number k, which is greater than zero. I need to find what k is. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me recall the formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle. The perimeter P is calculated as 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, right? So, P = 2L + 2W. And the area A is just length multiplied by width, so A = L * W.In this problem, the length is three times the width. Let me denote the width as W. Then the length L would be 3W. That makes sense. So, substituting that into the formulas, the perimeter becomes 2*(3W) + 2*W, which simplifies to 6W + 2W, so 8W. And the area would be 3W * W, which is 3W².Now, the problem states that both the perimeter and the area are numerically equal to k. So, that means 8W = k and 3W² = k. Since both equal k, I can set them equal to each other. So, 8W = 3W².Hmm, okay, so I have the equation 8W = 3W². Let me rearrange this to form a quadratic equation. Subtracting 8W from both sides gives 3W² - 8W = 0. I can factor out a W, so W*(3W - 8) = 0.Setting each factor equal to zero gives me two solutions: W = 0 or 3W - 8 = 0. But since the width can't be zero (because then the rectangle wouldn't exist), I discard W = 0. So, solving 3W - 8 = 0 gives 3W = 8, which means W = 8/3.Alright, so the width is 8/3. Then, the length, which is three times the width, would be 3*(8/3) = 8. So, the length is 8 and the width is 8/3.Now, let me find k by plugging these back into either the perimeter or the area. Let's do both to make sure they give the same k.First, the perimeter: 2L + 2W = 2*8 + 2*(8/3) = 16 + 16/3. To add these, I can convert 16 to thirds: 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 + 16/3 = 64/3. So, k is 64/3.Now, the area: L*W = 8*(8/3) = 64/3. Yep, that's the same as the perimeter. So, k is indeed 64/3.Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning: length is three times the width, so L = 3W. Perimeter is 2L + 2W, which is 2*(3W) + 2W = 6W + 2W = 8W. Area is L*W = 3W*W = 3W². Setting them equal: 8W = 3W². Moving everything to one side: 3W² - 8W = 0. Factoring: W(3W - 8) = 0. Solutions: W=0 or W=8/3. Discarding W=0, so W=8/3. Then L=8. Calculating perimeter: 2*8 + 2*(8/3) = 16 + 16/3 = 64/3. Area: 8*(8/3)=64/3. So, both give k=64/3. Seems correct.I was a bit worried when I saw the fractions, but it all checks out. So, k is 64/3.**Final Answer**The value of ( k ) is boxed{dfrac{64}{3}}."},{"question":"A cylindrical water tank with a base radius of 3cm is half full of water. Now, two spheres, each with a diameter equal to the diameter of the base of the tank, are placed into the tank. If the tank is just filled with water, then the height of the tank is ______ cm.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a cylindrical water tank. Let me try to visualize it first. The tank has a base radius of 3 cm, so the diameter of the base is twice that, which is 6 cm. The tank is half full of water initially. Then, two spheres are placed into the tank, each with a diameter equal to the diameter of the base, so each sphere has a diameter of 6 cm as well. After placing these spheres, the tank is just filled with water. I need to find the height of the tank.Hmm, let me break this down. First, the tank is a cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the tank is half full initially, the volume of water is (1/2)πr²h. But wait, actually, the height of the water is half the height of the tank. So if the total height of the tank is H, then the initial water height is H/2.Now, when we add the two spheres, the water level rises to the top, meaning the total volume of water plus the volume displaced by the spheres equals the total volume of the cylinder. So, the volume displaced by the spheres is equal to the volume of the cylinder minus the initial volume of water.Let me write that down:Volume of cylinder = πr²HInitial volume of water = (1/2)πr²HVolume displaced by spheres = Volume of cylinder - Initial volume of water = (1/2)πr²HSo, the combined volume of the two spheres should be equal to (1/2)πr²H.Wait, but actually, when you submerge objects in water, the volume displaced is equal to the volume of the submerged part of the objects. In this case, the spheres are placed into the tank, and the water just fills up the tank, so the spheres must be fully submerged because otherwise, if they weren't, the water wouldn't reach the top. So, the volume displaced by each sphere is equal to the volume of the sphere.Since there are two spheres, the total displaced volume is 2 times the volume of one sphere.So, let me compute the volume of one sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius of the sphere. The diameter of each sphere is 6 cm, so the radius is 3 cm.Therefore, the volume of one sphere is (4/3)π*(3)³ = (4/3)π*27 = 36π cm³.So, two spheres would have a combined volume of 2*36π = 72π cm³.Earlier, I established that the displaced volume is equal to (1/2)πr²H. The radius of the tank is 3 cm, so plugging that in:(1/2)*π*(3)²*H = (1/2)*π*9*H = (9/2)πH.So, according to the displaced volume equation:72π = (9/2)πHLet me solve for H.First, divide both sides by π:72 = (9/2)HMultiply both sides by 2:144 = 9HDivide both sides by 9:H = 144 / 9 = 16 cm.Wait, so the height of the tank is 16 cm? Let me double-check my steps.1. The radius of the tank is 3 cm, so diameter is 6 cm. Each sphere has a diameter of 6 cm, so radius 3 cm.2. Volume of one sphere: (4/3)π*(3)^3 = 36π. Two spheres: 72π.3. The tank is half full initially, so the volume of water is (1/2)*π*(3)^2*H = (9/2)πH.4. When the spheres are submerged, the displaced water volume is equal to the volume of the spheres, which is 72π. This displaced volume is also equal to the increase in water volume in the tank.But wait, hold on. The tank was initially half full, and after adding the spheres, it's full. So the displaced volume is equal to the volume of the tank minus the initial volume.Which is:Volume displaced = Volume of cylinder - Volume of initial water= πr²H - (1/2)πr²H= (1/2)πr²HWhich is what I had earlier. So, 72π = (9/2)πH.Solving for H gives 16 cm. Hmm, that seems correct.But wait, let me think again. If the tank's height is 16 cm, and it's half full initially, so water height is 8 cm. Then, when we add two spheres, each with diameter 6 cm, which is the same as the diameter of the tank, so the spheres are just fitting into the tank.But wait, if the spheres are 6 cm in diameter, and the tank is 16 cm tall, then placing two spheres into the tank would require that the height of the tank is at least the diameter of the spheres, which is 6 cm, but since we have two spheres, perhaps they are stacked on top of each other? But the tank is only 16 cm tall, so two spheres of 6 cm diameter each would require 12 cm of height, which is less than 16 cm. So, that would mean that the spheres are submerged into the water, but the water only rises to fill the tank.Wait, but the initial water height is 8 cm, and the spheres are 6 cm in diameter. So, if we place the spheres into the tank, the water level would rise. But the spheres themselves take up space, so the water would rise to the top, which is 16 cm. So, the spheres are submerged in the water, and the water level goes from 8 cm to 16 cm, which is an increase of 8 cm.But wait, the volume displaced by the spheres is equal to the volume of water that rises. So, the volume displaced is equal to the volume of the spheres, which is 72π, and also equal to the volume of the cylindrical section that is filled by the rising water.The volume of water that rises is πr²*(Δh), where Δh is 8 cm. So, π*(3)^2*8 = 9π*8 = 72π. So, that matches with the displaced volume.Therefore, the calculations seem consistent.So, the height of the tank is 16 cm.Wait, but just to make sure, let me recap:- Tank radius: 3 cm, so area of base: π*(3)^2 = 9π cm².- Initial water volume: (1/2)*9π*H = (9/2)πH.- After adding spheres, water volume: 9π*H.- So, the increase in water volume is 9π*H - (9/2)πH = (9/2)πH.- This increase equals the volume displaced by the spheres, which is 72π.So, (9/2)πH = 72π => (9/2)H = 72 => H = (72*2)/9 = 16 cm.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the height of the tank is 16 cm.**Final Answer**The height of the tank is boxed{16} cm."},{"question":"Given an even function f(x) satisfies f(x+2)=xf(x) for all x in mathbb{R}, then f(1) = ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: an even function f(x) satisfies f(x + 2) = x f(x) for all real numbers x, and I need to find f(1). Hmm, let's see. I remember that an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x. So, that might come in handy somewhere.First, let me write down what I know:1. f is even: f(-x) = f(x) for all x.2. f(x + 2) = x f(x) for all x.I need to find f(1). Maybe I can plug in specific values of x into the functional equation to find a relationship that involves f(1).Let me try plugging in x = 1. Then, the equation becomes:f(1 + 2) = 1 * f(1) => f(3) = f(1).Okay, so f(3) is equal to f(1). That's one relationship.What if I plug in x = 3? Then, f(3 + 2) = 3 f(3) => f(5) = 3 f(3). But since f(3) = f(1), this becomes f(5) = 3 f(1).Hmm, so f(5) is 3 times f(1). Interesting.Wait, maybe I can go the other way. Let me try plugging in x = -1. Since f is even, f(-1) = f(1). Let's see what the functional equation gives us when x = -1:f(-1 + 2) = (-1) f(-1) => f(1) = -f(-1).But since f is even, f(-1) = f(1), so substituting that in:f(1) = -f(1).Wait, that's interesting. So f(1) = -f(1). If I add f(1) to both sides, I get 2 f(1) = 0, which implies f(1) = 0.Oh! So, is f(1) equal to zero? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting again, plug in x = -1 into the functional equation:f(-1 + 2) = (-1) f(-1) => f(1) = -f(-1).But since f is even, f(-1) = f(1). Therefore, f(1) = -f(1). Adding f(1) to both sides gives 2 f(1) = 0, so f(1) = 0.That seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.Alternatively, maybe I can express f(x) in terms of f(x - 2). Let's rearrange the functional equation:f(x + 2) = x f(x) => f(x) = (x - 2) f(x - 2).So, f(x) can be written as (x - 2) times f(x - 2). Maybe I can iterate this process.Starting from f(1):f(1) = (1 - 2) f(1 - 2) = (-1) f(-1).But f(-1) = f(1), so f(1) = (-1) f(1). Again, f(1) = -f(1), so 2 f(1) = 0, which gives f(1) = 0.Same result. Hmm, seems solid.Wait, let's try plugging in x = 0. Sometimes plugging in x = 0 can give useful information.f(0 + 2) = 0 * f(0) => f(2) = 0.So f(2) is zero. Interesting. Maybe we can find more zeros.What about x = 2? Then f(2 + 2) = 2 f(2) => f(4) = 2 * 0 = 0. So f(4) is also zero.Similarly, x = 4: f(4 + 2) = 4 f(4) => f(6) = 4 * 0 = 0. So f(6) = 0.Hmm, so f(2) = f(4) = f(6) = 0. That's a pattern.What about negative x? Let's try x = -2.f(-2 + 2) = (-2) f(-2) => f(0) = (-2) f(-2).But f is even, so f(-2) = f(2) = 0. Therefore, f(0) = (-2) * 0 = 0.So f(0) is zero as well.Wait, so f(0) = 0, f(2) = 0, f(4) = 0, etc. Maybe all even integers have f(n) = 0? Let me test x = -4.f(-4 + 2) = (-4) f(-4) => f(-2) = (-4) f(-4).But f(-2) = f(2) = 0, so 0 = (-4) f(-4). Therefore, f(-4) = 0, which is consistent with f(4) = 0.So, it seems like f(n) = 0 for all even integers n.But what about the odd integers? We know f(1) = 0, f(3) = f(1) = 0, f(5) = 3 f(3) = 0, and so on. So, actually, f(n) = 0 for all integers n.Wait, that's a big conclusion. So, f is zero at all integers. But is that necessarily the case for all real numbers?Wait, no, the functional equation is given for all real numbers x, not just integers. So, f(x + 2) = x f(x) for any real x.But we found that f(1) = 0, and f(3) = f(1) = 0, and f(5) = 3 f(3) = 0, etc. So, all odd integers have f(n) = 0 as well.But maybe f is zero everywhere? Let me test that.Suppose f(x) = 0 for all x. Then, f(x + 2) = 0 = x * 0 = x f(x). So, yes, that satisfies the functional equation. Also, f is even because f(-x) = 0 = f(x). So, the zero function is a solution.But is it the only solution? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify any other conditions, like continuity or differentiability, so maybe the zero function is the only solution. Therefore, f(1) must be zero.Alternatively, perhaps there's a non-zero solution. Let me think about that.Suppose f is not identically zero. Then, there exists some x where f(x) ≠ 0. Let's see if that's possible.From the functional equation, f(x + 2) = x f(x). So, if f(x) ≠ 0, then f(x + 2) = x f(x). But then, if x is such that f(x) ≠ 0, then f(x + 2) is determined by x f(x). But then, for x + 2, we can write f(x + 4) = (x + 2) f(x + 2) = (x + 2) x f(x). Similarly, f(x + 6) = (x + 4) f(x + 4) = (x + 4)(x + 2) x f(x), and so on.But since f is even, f(-x) = f(x). So, f(-x + 2) = (-x) f(-x) = (-x) f(x). But f(-x + 2) is also equal to f(x - 2) because f is even: f(-x + 2) = f(x - 2).Therefore, f(x - 2) = (-x) f(x). But from the original functional equation, f(x) = (x - 2) f(x - 2). So, substituting f(x - 2) from the above, we get:f(x) = (x - 2)(-x) f(x) = (-x)(x - 2) f(x).So, f(x) = (-x)(x - 2) f(x).Let me write that as:f(x) = (-x)(x - 2) f(x).Then, bringing all terms to one side:f(x) + x(x - 2) f(x) = 0 => [1 + x(x - 2)] f(x) = 0.So, [1 + x^2 - 2x] f(x) = 0.Therefore, either f(x) = 0 or 1 + x^2 - 2x = 0.Solving 1 + x^2 - 2x = 0: x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 => (x - 1)^2 = 0 => x = 1.So, for all x ≠ 1, f(x) must be zero. But at x = 1, the equation is satisfied regardless of f(1), because 1 + (1)^2 - 2*(1) = 1 + 1 - 2 = 0, so the equation becomes 0 * f(1) = 0, which is always true.But wait, earlier we found that f(1) = 0. So, even at x = 1, f(1) must be zero.Therefore, f(x) must be zero for all x.Hence, f is identically zero, so f(1) = 0.Therefore, the answer is 0.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(1) ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"The number of students in a certain class is greater than 20 and less than 30.

The number of students who signed up for the \\"Hua Cup\\" competition is 1 less than three times the number of students who did not sign up. How many students are there in the class?","answer":"First, let's determine the possible total number of students in the class. The problem states that the number of students is greater than 20 and less than 30. Therefore, the possible total number of students is 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, or 28.Next, we know that the number of female students is twice the number of male students. Let’s denote the number of male students as ( m ) and the number of female students as ( f ). According to the problem, ( f = 2m ). Therefore, the total number of students ( t ) is ( t = m + f = m + 2m = 3m ). This means that the total number of students must be a multiple of 3. From the possible total numbers, the multiples of 3 are 21, 24, and 27.Now, let's consider the number of students who signed up for the \\"Hua Cup\\" competition. The problem states that the number of students who signed up is 1 less than three times the number of students who did not sign up. Let’s denote the number of students who signed up as ( s ) and the number who did not sign up as ( n ). According to the problem, ( s = 3n - 1 ). Since the total number of students is ( t ), we have ( s + n = t ). Substituting ( s ) from the first equation into the second, we get ( 3n - 1 + n = t ), which simplifies to ( 4n - 1 = t ). Therefore, ( t = 4n - 1 ).We can now test the possible total numbers:- For ( t = 21 ): ( 4n - 1 = 21 ) leads to ( n = 5.5 ), which is not an integer.- For ( t = 24 ): ( 4n - 1 = 24 ) leads to ( n = 6.25 ), which is not an integer.- For ( t = 27 ): ( 4n - 1 = 27 ) leads to ( n = 7 ), which is an integer.Thus, the only valid total number of students is 27."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function H(a,e,h,u,o,n){const d=b("PoemCard");return i(),s("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 DeepSeek-R1 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",L,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",F,[(i(!0),s(y,null,w(n.filteredPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),x(d,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),s("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},[o.isLoading?(i(),s("span",M,"Loading...")):(i(),s("span",N,"See more"))],8,z)):v("",!0)])}const D=m(W,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-e3da842b"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/50.md","filePath":"people/50.md"}'),K={name:"people/50.md"},E=Object.assign(K,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(i(),s("div",null,[S(D)]))}});export{O as __pageData,E as default};
