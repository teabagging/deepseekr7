How many different ways are there to achieve this arrangement?(A) 12  (B) 24  (C) 42  (D) 48","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 3x3 grid with numbers 1 through 9, each number used exactly once. The conditions are that in each row, the numbers increase from left to right, and in each column, the numbers decrease from top to bottom. I need to figure out how many different ways I can do this. The options given are 12, 24, 42, or 48. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 3x3 grid, so there are 9 cells. Each row has to be increasing from left to right, which means that in the first row, the smallest number will be on the left, and the largest on the right. Similarly, for the second and third rows. On the other hand, each column has to be decreasing from top to bottom, so the largest number in each column will be at the top, and the smallest at the bottom.So, if I think about the grid, the top-left corner must be the largest number in its row and column. Wait, actually, since the first row is increasing, the first cell is the smallest in its row, but since the first column is decreasing, the first cell is the largest in its column. So, the top-left cell is the smallest in its row but the largest in its column. That seems a bit conflicting, but maybe it's possible.Wait, let me clarify. In the first row, numbers increase from left to right, so the first cell is the smallest in the first row. In the first column, numbers decrease from top to bottom, so the first cell is the largest in the first column. So, the top-left cell is both the smallest in its row and the largest in its column. That means that the number in the top-left cell must be larger than all the numbers below it in the first column but smaller than all the numbers to the right in the first row.Similarly, the top-right cell is the largest in its row (since the row is increasing) and the smallest in its column (since the column is decreasing). So, the top-right cell is the largest in the first row but the smallest in the third column.This seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can approach this by considering the possible numbers that can be placed in each cell based on these constraints.Let me think about the center cell. Since the grid is 3x3, the center cell is part of both the middle row and the middle column. The middle row has to be increasing, so the center cell is larger than the cell to its left and smaller than the cell to its right. Similarly, the middle column has to be decreasing, so the center cell is smaller than the cell above it and larger than the cell below it.So, the center cell is kind of a pivot point. It has to be larger than the cell above it and the cell to its left, and smaller than the cell below it and the cell to its right.Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. In the middle column, numbers decrease from top to bottom, so the cell above the center is larger than the center, and the cell below is smaller. In the middle row, numbers increase from left to right, so the cell to the left is smaller than the center, and the cell to the right is larger. So, yes, the center cell is sandwiched between larger numbers above and to the right, and smaller numbers below and to the left.So, the center cell must be a number that is neither too big nor too small. Maybe it's somewhere in the middle of the range 1-9. Let's think about possible numbers for the center.Since the grid has numbers 1 through 9, the center cell can't be 1 or 9 because it has to be larger than some numbers and smaller than others. Similarly, it can't be 2 or 8 because it needs to have enough numbers both above and below it in the column and to the left and right in the row.Wait, actually, let's think more carefully. The center cell has to be larger than the cell above it and the cell to its left, and smaller than the cell below it and the cell to its right. So, the cell above it must be larger than the center, and the cell below must be smaller. Similarly, the cell to the left must be smaller, and the cell to the right must be larger.Therefore, the center cell must be greater than two numbers (above and left) and less than two numbers (below and right). So, in terms of the entire grid, the center cell is the fourth or fifth number? Wait, maybe not exactly, but it's somewhere in the middle.Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a Young tableau. A Young tableau is a matrix where numbers increase across each row and down each column. Wait, but in this case, the rows increase and the columns decrease, so it's a bit different. Maybe it's a reverse Young tableau?Wait, actually, in a standard Young tableau, rows increase to the right and columns increase downward. Here, rows increase to the right, but columns decrease downward. So, it's like a reverse in the columns. Maybe this is a kind of dual or something.But maybe I can still use some concepts from Young tableaux. The number of standard Young tableaux of a given shape is given by the hook-length formula. Maybe I can use that here.Wait, but in our case, the grid is 3x3, and the conditions are that rows increase and columns decrease. So, it's a 3x3 grid with row-increasing and column-decreasing. So, is there a formula for the number of such tableaux?Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a permutation matrix with certain constraints.Wait, another approach: Since each row is increasing and each column is decreasing, the grid is a permutation matrix where each row is increasing and each column is decreasing. So, maybe this is equivalent to a permutation matrix that is both row-increasing and column-decreasing.Wait, but actually, the grid is filled with numbers 1 through 9, each exactly once, so it's a Latin square? No, not necessarily, because in a Latin square, each number appears exactly once in each row and column, but here, the numbers are just 1 through 9, each once, but the constraints are on the order.Wait, perhaps I can model this as a permutation matrix where the rows are increasing and columns are decreasing.Wait, maybe I can think of the grid as a matrix where each row is increasing and each column is decreasing, so it's a kind of order matrix.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of a permutation matrix with certain properties.Wait, another idea: Since each row is increasing, the numbers in each row must be a combination of three numbers in increasing order. Similarly, each column must be decreasing, so each column is a combination of three numbers in decreasing order.But since all numbers from 1 to 9 are used exactly once, the entire grid is a 3x3 matrix with distinct numbers 1-9, rows increasing left to right, and columns decreasing top to bottom.This seems similar to a standard Young tableau, except that in a standard Young tableau, both rows and columns are increasing. Here, rows are increasing, columns are decreasing. So, maybe it's a kind of dual.Wait, is there a formula for the number of such matrices? I'm not sure, but maybe I can compute it by considering the possible placements of numbers.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the grid as a permutation matrix where the rows are increasing and columns are decreasing, so each row is a set of three numbers in increasing order, and each column is a set of three numbers in decreasing order.Wait, maybe I can think of the grid as a 3x3 matrix where each row is increasing and each column is decreasing. So, the first row must be the three smallest numbers, but arranged in increasing order. Wait, no, because the columns are decreasing, so the first column must be the three largest numbers in decreasing order.Wait, that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think.Wait, the first column has to be decreasing, so the top of the first column is the largest number in that column, and the bottom is the smallest. Similarly, the first row has to be increasing, so the leftmost number is the smallest in that row, and the rightmost is the largest.So, the top-left corner is the smallest in its row and the largest in its column. So, it's the smallest in the first row and the largest in the first column.Similarly, the top-right corner is the largest in its row and the smallest in its column.So, the top-left is the smallest in its row, so it's 1? Wait, no, because it's the largest in its column, so it has to be larger than the numbers below it in the first column.Wait, so the top-left number is larger than the numbers below it in the first column, but it's also the smallest in its row. So, the top-left number is the smallest in the first row but larger than the numbers in the first column below it.So, the top-left number must be greater than the numbers in the first column below it, but less than the numbers in the first row to its right.Similarly, the top-right number is the largest in the first row, but the smallest in the third column.So, the top-right number is larger than the numbers to its left in the first row, but smaller than the numbers below it in the third column.So, perhaps the top-left number is 5, and the top-right is 5? Wait, no, because all numbers are distinct.Wait, maybe I can consider possible numbers for the top-left and top-right.Wait, the top-left number has to be larger than the numbers below it in the first column, which are two numbers. So, the top-left number must be greater than two numbers, so it can't be 1, 2, or 3, because if it's 1, it can't be greater than any number, which is impossible. If it's 2, it can only be greater than 1, but there are two numbers below it, so 2 can't be greater than both. Similarly, 3 can only be greater than 1 and 2, but if the numbers below it are, say, 4 and 5, 3 can't be greater than them. So, the top-left number must be at least 4.Similarly, the top-right number is the largest in the first row, so it's greater than the numbers to its left. It's also the smallest in the third column, so it's smaller than the numbers below it in the third column. So, the top-right number must be less than two numbers below it in the third column. So, it can't be 9, 8, or 7, because if it's 9, it can't be smaller than any number below it. If it's 8, it can only be smaller than 9, but there are two numbers below it, so 8 can't be smaller than both. Similarly, 7 can only be smaller than 8 and 9, but if the numbers below it are, say, 6 and 5, 7 can't be smaller than them. So, the top-right number must be at most 6.So, the top-left number is at least 4, and the top-right number is at most 6.So, possible top-left numbers: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.Possible top-right numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.But wait, since the top-left is in the first row, which is increasing, the top-left must be less than the top-middle and top-right. Similarly, the top-right is greater than the top-middle and top-left.But also, the top-left is greater than the numbers below it in the first column, which are the middle-left and bottom-left.Similarly, the top-right is less than the numbers below it in the third column, which are the middle-right and bottom-right.So, maybe I can try to figure out the possible numbers for the top-left and top-right.Let me consider the top-left number. It must be greater than the middle-left and bottom-left numbers. So, if the top-left is 4, then the middle-left and bottom-left must be less than 4, i.e., 1, 2, or 3.Similarly, if the top-left is 5, then the middle-left and bottom-left must be less than 5, i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 4.Similarly, if the top-left is 6, then the middle-left and bottom-left must be less than 6, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.But also, the first row must be increasing, so the top-left is less than top-middle, which is less than top-right.Similarly, the first column is decreasing, so top-left is greater than middle-left, which is greater than bottom-left.So, let's try to think about possible assignments.Case 1: Top-left is 4.Then, the first column must have two numbers below 4, so middle-left and bottom-left must be 1, 2, or 3.Also, the first row must be increasing, so top-middle and top-right must be greater than 4.Since the top-right is at most 6, as we saw earlier, so top-right can be 5 or 6.Wait, but if top-left is 4, and top-right is 5 or 6, then the top-middle must be between 4 and 5 or 4 and 6.But let's see:If top-left is 4, top-right is 5, then top-middle must be 5? But 5 is already used as top-right. Wait, no, top-middle can be 5, but then top-right would have to be greater than 5, but we said top-right is at most 6. So, top-right could be 6.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of possible assignments.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a permutation problem with constraints.Wait, another idea: Since each row is increasing and each column is decreasing, the grid is a permutation matrix where rows are increasing and columns are decreasing. So, each row is a set of three numbers in increasing order, and each column is a set of three numbers in decreasing order.This is similar to a 3x3 grid where each row is a combination of three numbers in increasing order, and each column is a combination of three numbers in decreasing order, with all numbers from 1 to 9 used exactly once.This seems like a problem that can be approached using the concept of permutation matrices with specific constraints.Wait, maybe I can think of it as a 3x3 grid where each row is a combination of three numbers in increasing order, and each column is a combination of three numbers in decreasing order.So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such grids.Wait, I recall that the number of 3x3 permutation matrices where rows are increasing and columns are decreasing is equal to the number of standard Young tableaux of shape 3x3, but with columns decreasing instead of increasing. Hmm, but standard Young tableaux have both rows and columns increasing.Wait, maybe it's related to the number of semistandard Young tableaux, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the hook-length formula for standard Young tableaux, but adjust it for the column constraints.Wait, the hook-length formula gives the number of standard Young tableaux for a given shape. For a 3x3 grid, the number is 42. Wait, that's one of the answer choices. Hmm, but in our case, the columns are decreasing, not increasing. So, is it the same as the number of standard Young tableaux?Wait, no, because in a standard Young tableau, both rows and columns are increasing. Here, rows are increasing and columns are decreasing, so it's a different structure.Wait, but maybe the number is the same because it's just a matter of orientation. If I reverse the order of the columns, perhaps it becomes a standard Young tableau. So, maybe the number is the same as the number of standard Young tableaux of shape 3x3, which is 42. So, the answer might be 42.But wait, let me verify that. The number of standard Young tableaux of a 3x3 grid is indeed 42, calculated by the hook-length formula. The hook length for each cell is as follows:For the first row, the hook lengths are 5, 4, 3.For the second row, the hook lengths are 3, 2, 1.For the third row, the hook lengths are 3, 2, 1.Wait, no, actually, the hook length for each cell is the number of cells to the right and below, including itself.So, for a 3x3 grid:First row: 5, 4, 3Second row: 3, 2, 1Third row: 3, 2, 1Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate.Wait, the hook length for a cell (i,j) is the number of cells directly to the right in the same row, directly below in the same column, plus one for the cell itself.So, for a 3x3 grid:First row, first cell: hook length is 3 (right) + 3 (below) + 1 = 7? Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, actually, for a Young diagram, the hook length is the number of cells to the right in the same row, plus the number of cells below in the same column, plus one for the cell itself.So, for the first cell (1,1):Number of cells to the right: 2Number of cells below: 2So, hook length = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.Similarly, for cell (1,2):Number of cells to the right: 1Number of cells below: 2Hook length = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.Cell (1,3):Number of cells to the right: 0Number of cells below: 2Hook length = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3.Second row, first cell (2,1):Number of cells to the right: 2Number of cells below: 1Hook length = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in the second row, first column, the number of cells to the right is 2 (since it's a 3x3 grid), but the number of cells below is 1 (only the third row). So, hook length = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.Similarly, cell (2,2):Number of cells to the right: 1Number of cells below: 1Hook length = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.Cell (2,3):Number of cells to the right: 0Number of cells below: 1Hook length = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.Third row, first cell (3,1):Number of cells to the right: 2Number of cells below: 0Hook length = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3.Cell (3,2):Number of cells to the right: 1Number of cells below: 0Hook length = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.Cell (3,3):Number of cells to the right: 0Number of cells below: 0Hook length = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.So, the hook lengths for the 3x3 grid are:5 4 34 3 23 2 1Then, the number of standard Young tableaux is given by the hook-length formula:Number of SYTs = 9! / (5*4*3*4*3*2*3*2*1)Let me compute that.First, compute the denominator:5 * 4 * 3 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 2 * 1Let me compute step by step:5 * 4 = 2020 * 3 = 6060 * 4 = 240240 * 3 = 720720 * 2 = 14401440 * 3 = 43204320 * 2 = 86408640 * 1 = 8640So, denominator is 8640.Numerator is 9! = 362880.So, 362880 / 8640 = let's compute that.Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 36288 / 864Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 4536 / 108Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 378 / 9 = 42.So, the number of standard Young tableaux is 42. So, that's one of the answer choices, option C.But wait, in our problem, the columns are decreasing instead of increasing. So, is the number of such tableaux the same as the number of standard Young tableaux?Wait, in a standard Young tableau, both rows and columns are increasing. In our case, rows are increasing, columns are decreasing. So, it's a different structure.But is there a bijection between such tableaux and standard Young tableaux? Maybe by reversing the order of the columns or something.Wait, if I reverse the order of the columns, then the columns that were decreasing become increasing. So, if I have a grid where rows are increasing and columns are decreasing, and I reverse the order of the columns, I get a grid where rows are increasing (since reversing columns doesn't affect row order) and columns are increasing. So, that would be a standard Young tableau.Therefore, the number of such grids is equal to the number of standard Young tableaux of shape 3x3, which is 42. So, the answer is 42, which is option C.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a bijection between the two? If I reverse the columns, does that map each grid with rows increasing and columns decreasing to a standard Young tableau?Yes, because reversing the columns would turn the decreasing columns into increasing columns, while the rows remain increasing because reversing columns doesn't affect the row order.Therefore, the number of such grids is equal to the number of standard Young tableaux, which is 42.So, I think the answer is 42, which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given the equation in terms of x: frac{3x-m}{2}-frac{x+m}{3}=frac{5}{6}.  (1) If m=-1, find the solution to the equation.  (2) If x=5 is a solution to the equation, find the value of frac{1}{2}m^2+2m.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: (3x - m)/2 - (x + m)/3 = 5/6. There are two parts to the problem. Let me tackle them one by one.Starting with part (1): If m = -1, find the solution to the equation.Alright, so m is given as -1. I need to substitute m = -1 into the equation and solve for x. Let me write down the equation with m replaced by -1.So, substituting m = -1, the equation becomes:(3x - (-1))/2 - (x + (-1))/3 = 5/6Simplify the numerators:(3x + 1)/2 - (x - 1)/3 = 5/6Hmm, okay. Now, to solve this equation, I think I should eliminate the denominators first. The denominators are 2, 3, and 6. The least common denominator (LCD) here is 6. So, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to get rid of the fractions.Multiplying each term by 6:6*(3x + 1)/2 - 6*(x - 1)/3 = 6*(5/6)Simplify each term:6/2 is 3, so 3*(3x + 1) = 9x + 3Similarly, 6/3 is 2, so 2*(x - 1) = 2x - 2And on the right side, 6*(5/6) is just 5.So, putting it all together:9x + 3 - (2x - 2) = 5Wait, hold on. I have to remember that the second term is subtracted, so I need to distribute the negative sign.So, expanding that:9x + 3 - 2x + 2 = 5Combine like terms:9x - 2x is 7x3 + 2 is 5So, 7x + 5 = 5Now, subtract 5 from both sides:7x = 0Divide both sides by 7:x = 0Hmm, so x equals 0 when m is -1. Let me check if that makes sense by plugging x = 0 and m = -1 back into the original equation.Original equation:(3*0 - (-1))/2 - (0 + (-1))/3 = ?Simplify:(0 + 1)/2 - (0 - 1)/3 = 1/2 - (-1)/3 = 1/2 + 1/3Convert to common denominator:3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6Which is equal to the right side of the equation, 5/6. So, yes, x = 0 is correct.Alright, part (1) is done. Now, moving on to part (2): If x = 5 is a solution to the equation, find the value of (1/2)m² + 2m.So, this time, x is given as 5, and I need to find m first, then compute (1/2)m² + 2m.Let me substitute x = 5 into the original equation:(3*5 - m)/2 - (5 + m)/3 = 5/6Simplify the numerators:(15 - m)/2 - (5 + m)/3 = 5/6Again, I can eliminate the denominators by multiplying both sides by 6, the LCD.Multiplying each term by 6:6*(15 - m)/2 - 6*(5 + m)/3 = 6*(5/6)Simplify each term:6/2 is 3, so 3*(15 - m) = 45 - 3m6/3 is 2, so 2*(5 + m) = 10 + 2mRight side: 6*(5/6) is 5Putting it all together:45 - 3m - (10 + 2m) = 5Again, distribute the negative sign:45 - 3m - 10 - 2m = 5Combine like terms:45 - 10 is 35-3m - 2m is -5mSo, 35 - 5m = 5Subtract 35 from both sides:-5m = 5 - 35-5m = -30Divide both sides by -5:m = 6Okay, so m is 6. Now, I need to compute (1/2)m² + 2m.Let me plug m = 6 into that expression:(1/2)*(6)² + 2*(6)First, compute 6 squared: 6*6 = 36Then, (1/2)*36 = 18Next, 2*6 = 12Add them together: 18 + 12 = 30So, the value is 30.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with x = 5:(15 - m)/2 - (5 + m)/3 = 5/6Multiply by 6:3*(15 - m) - 2*(5 + m) = 5Which is 45 - 3m -10 -2m = 5Simplify: 35 -5m =5Subtract 35: -5m = -30Divide: m=6Then, compute (1/2)*36 +12=18+12=30. Yep, that seems correct.So, both parts are done. I think I got them right.**Final Answer**(1) The solution is boxed{0}.(2) The value is boxed{30}."},{"question":"For a transatlantic flight, three flight attendants are selected by lot from 20 girls competing for these positions. Seven of them are blondes, and the rest are brunettes. What is the probability that among the three chosen flight attendants there will be at least one blonde and at least one brunette?","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem here about selecting flight attendants. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says: For a transatlantic flight, three flight attendants are selected by lot from 20 girls competing for these positions. Seven of them are blondes, and the rest are brunettes. What is the probability that among the three chosen flight attendants there will be at least one blonde and at least one brunette?Alright, so we have 20 girls total. Out of these, 7 are blondes, which means the remaining 13 must be brunettes. We need to find the probability that when we select 3 girls, there is at least one blonde and at least one brunette. Hmm, okay. So, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that when dealing with \\"at least one\\" scenarios, it's often helpful to use the complementary probability. That is, instead of calculating the probability of the event happening directly, we calculate the probability of the event not happening and subtract it from 1.So, in this case, the event we're interested in is having at least one blonde and at least one brunette. The complementary event would be having all blondes or all brunettes. So, if I can find the probability of selecting all blondes or all brunettes, then subtract that from 1, I should get the desired probability.Let me write that down:Probability(at least one blonde and one brunette) = 1 - Probability(all blondes or all brunettes)But wait, actually, since all blondes and all brunettes are mutually exclusive events (you can't have all blondes and all brunettes at the same time), I can calculate each probability separately and then add them together.So, Probability(all blondes or all brunettes) = Probability(all blondes) + Probability(all brunettes)Therefore, the formula becomes:Probability(at least one blonde and one brunette) = 1 - [Probability(all blondes) + Probability(all brunettes)]Alright, now I need to calculate Probability(all blondes) and Probability(all brunettes).Since the selection is done by lot, I assume it's a random selection without replacement. So, this is a hypergeometric probability problem, but since we're dealing with combinations, I can use combinations to calculate the probabilities.First, let's figure out the total number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 20. That's the denominator for all our probabilities.Total combinations = C(20, 3)Where C(n, k) is the combination formula, which is n! / (k! * (n - k)! )Calculating that:C(20, 3) = 20! / (3! * 17!) = (20 * 19 * 18) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 1140So, there are 1140 possible ways to choose 3 girls from 20.Now, let's calculate the number of ways to choose all blondes. There are 7 blondes, so we need to choose all 3 from them.Number of ways to choose all blondes = C(7, 3)Calculating that:C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * 4!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35Similarly, the number of ways to choose all brunettes. There are 13 brunettes, so we need to choose all 3 from them.Number of ways to choose all brunettes = C(13, 3)Calculating that:C(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * 10!) = (13 * 12 * 11) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 286So, the number of ways to choose all blondes is 35, and all brunettes is 286. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose either all blondes or all brunettes is 35 + 286 = 321.Therefore, the probability of selecting all blondes or all brunettes is 321 / 1140.Let me compute that:321 divided by 1140. Let me see, both numbers are divisible by 3.321 ÷ 3 = 1071140 ÷ 3 = 380So, 107 / 380. Hmm, can this be simplified further? Let's check.107 is a prime number, I believe, because it doesn't divide by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Let's see: 107 ÷ 13 is about 8.23, which isn't an integer. So, 107 is prime. 380 is 38 * 10, which is 2 * 19 * 2 * 5. So, no common factors. So, 107/380 is the simplified fraction.So, the probability of all blondes or all brunettes is 107/380.Therefore, the probability of having at least one blonde and one brunette is 1 - 107/380.Calculating that:1 is equal to 380/380, so 380/380 - 107/380 = (380 - 107)/380 = 273/380.Now, let's see if 273 and 380 have any common factors.273: Let's factor it. 273 ÷ 3 = 91. So, 3 * 91. 91 is 7 * 13. So, 273 = 3 * 7 * 13.380: As above, 380 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 19.So, no common factors between 273 and 380. Therefore, 273/380 is the simplified fraction.So, the probability is 273/380. Let me check if that can be simplified further or if I made a mistake in calculations.Wait, 273 divided by 3 is 91, and 380 divided by 3 is not an integer. So, no, it can't be simplified further.Alternatively, as a decimal, 273 divided by 380 is approximately 0.7184, so about 71.84%.Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 35 + 286 is 321, which is correct. 321 divided by 1140 is 0.2816, so 28.16%. Therefore, 1 - 0.2816 is 0.7184, which is about 71.84%. That seems reasonable.Alternatively, I can think of it as: the number of favorable outcomes is total combinations minus all blondes minus all brunettes, which is 1140 - 35 - 286 = 1140 - 321 = 819.Wait, hold on, 1140 - 321 is 819? Wait, 1140 - 300 is 840, then subtract 21 more is 819. So, 819 favorable outcomes.Therefore, probability is 819 / 1140.Simplify that: 819 ÷ 3 = 273, 1140 ÷ 3 = 380. So, 273/380, which is the same as before.So, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using probabilities step by step.Probability of at least one blonde and at least one brunette is equal to 1 - Probability(all blondes) - Probability(all brunettes).We already calculated Probability(all blondes) as C(7,3)/C(20,3) = 35/1140 ≈ 0.0307.Probability(all brunettes) is C(13,3)/C(20,3) = 286/1140 ≈ 0.2509.Adding those together: 0.0307 + 0.2509 ≈ 0.2816, which is approximately 28.16%.Subtracting from 1: 1 - 0.2816 ≈ 0.7184, which is 71.84%.So, that's consistent with the previous calculation.Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using another method, like considering the different cases.So, the favorable cases are when we have 1 blonde and 2 brunettes, or 2 blondes and 1 brunette.So, the number of ways to choose 1 blonde and 2 brunettes is C(7,1)*C(13,2).Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 blondes and 1 brunette is C(7,2)*C(13,1).Therefore, total favorable outcomes = C(7,1)*C(13,2) + C(7,2)*C(13,1).Let me compute each term.First, C(7,1) is 7, and C(13,2) is (13*12)/2 = 78. So, 7 * 78 = 546.Second, C(7,2) is (7*6)/2 = 21, and C(13,1) is 13. So, 21 * 13 = 273.Therefore, total favorable outcomes = 546 + 273 = 819.Which is the same as before. So, 819 / 1140 = 273 / 380 ≈ 0.7184.So, that's consistent.Therefore, the probability is 273/380, which is approximately 71.84%.Wait, just to make sure, let me verify the calculations once more.Total number of ways: C(20,3) = 1140. Correct.Number of all blondes: C(7,3) = 35. Correct.Number of all brunettes: C(13,3) = 286. Correct.Total unfavorable: 35 + 286 = 321. Correct.Favorable: 1140 - 321 = 819. Correct.Probability: 819 / 1140 = 273 / 380. Correct.Yes, that seems solid.Alternatively, thinking in terms of probability multiplication:The probability that the first person is a blonde is 7/20. Then, the second is also blonde: 6/19, and the third is blonde: 5/18. So, the probability of all blondes is (7/20)*(6/19)*(5/18) = (7*6*5)/(20*19*18) = 210 / 6840 = 7 / 228 ≈ 0.0307.Similarly, probability of all brunettes: first is brunette: 13/20, second: 12/19, third: 11/18. So, (13/20)*(12/19)*(11/18) = (13*12*11)/(20*19*18) = 1716 / 6840 = 1716 ÷ 12 = 143, 6840 ÷12=570. So, 143/570 ≈ 0.2509.Adding these together: 7/228 + 143/570. Let me compute that.First, find a common denominator. 228 and 570.228 factors: 2*2*3*19.570 factors: 2*3*5*19.So, the least common multiple is 2*3*5*19*2 = 1140.So, convert both fractions to denominator 1140.7/228 = (7*5)/1140 = 35/1140.143/570 = (143*2)/1140 = 286/1140.So, total is 35 + 286 = 321 / 1140, which is the same as before.So, 321/1140 = 107/380 ≈ 0.2816.Therefore, 1 - 0.2816 = 0.7184, which is 273/380.So, same result.Therefore, I can be confident that the probability is 273/380.Alternatively, if I wanted to write this as a decimal, it's approximately 0.7184, which is about 71.84%.So, to sum up, the probability that among the three chosen flight attendants there will be at least one blonde and at least one brunette is 273/380, or approximately 71.84%.I think that's thorough enough. I considered multiple methods: combinations, complementary probability, step-by-step probability multiplication, and verified each step. All approaches led me to the same answer, so I feel confident that this is correct.**Final Answer**The probability is boxed{dfrac{273}{380}}."},{"question":"What is the smallest possible perimeter of a scalene triangle with integer side lengths?","answer":"To determine the smallest possible perimeter of a scalene triangle with integer side lengths, I need to identify three distinct integers that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.I'll start by considering the smallest possible integers for the sides. Let's begin with the smallest integer, 1, but quickly realize that a triangle with sides 1, 2, and 3 doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality because 1 + 2 is not greater than 3.Next, I'll try the set of sides 2, 3, and 4. Checking the triangle inequality:- 2 + 3 > 4 (5 > 4)- 2 + 4 > 3 (6 > 3)- 3 + 4 > 2 (7 > 2)All conditions are satisfied, so a triangle with sides 2, 3, and 4 is valid. Adding these together, the perimeter is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.To ensure this is the smallest possible perimeter, I'll check if there's a smaller set of integers that meets the criteria. The next smallest set would be 1, 2, and 3, but as previously determined, it doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality. Therefore, the smallest possible perimeter for a scalene triangle with integer side lengths is 9."},{"question":"If the standard deviation of the numbers a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 is 2, then the variance of the numbers 3a_1-2, 3a_2-2, 3a_3-2, 3a_4-2, 3a_5-2 is","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: The standard deviation of the numbers a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄, a₅ is 2. I need to find the variance of the numbers 3a₁ - 2, 3a₂ - 2, 3a₃ - 2, 3a₄ - 2, 3a₅ - 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers are, and variance is just the square of the standard deviation. So if the standard deviation is 2, then the variance must be 2 squared, which is 4. That seems straightforward.But now, the question is about transforming each of the original numbers by multiplying them by 3 and then subtracting 2. I need to figure out how this transformation affects the variance. I think there's a property of variance that relates to linear transformations of data. Let me recall what that is.I remember that if you have a set of data and you apply a linear transformation to each data point, such as y = a*x + b, the variance of the new data set is a squared times the variance of the original data set. The constant term, b, doesn't affect the variance because it just shifts all the data points by the same amount, which doesn't change how spread out they are. So, in this case, since we're multiplying each a_i by 3 and then subtracting 2, the variance should be affected only by the multiplication by 3.So, applying that property, the variance of the transformed data should be (3)² times the original variance. Since the original variance is 4, that would be 9 * 4, which is 36. Therefore, the variance of the numbers 3a₁ - 2, 3a₂ - 2, etc., should be 36.Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, I get confused between how transformations affect mean and variance. The mean would be affected by both the multiplication and the subtraction, right? Because if you have y = a*x + b, the new mean is a times the original mean plus b. But variance is only affected by the scaling factor, not the shift. So, subtracting 2 doesn't change the spread, it just moves everything down by 2 units. So, yeah, only the multiplication by 3 affects the variance.Let me also think about why that is. Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. So, if you multiply each data point by 3, each deviation from the mean is also multiplied by 3. Then, when you square that deviation, it becomes 9 times the original squared deviation. Hence, the variance increases by a factor of 9. Subtracting 2 doesn't change the deviations from the mean because it subtracts the same amount from each data point, so the deviations remain the same. Therefore, the variance is only scaled by the square of the multiplication factor.Just to double-check, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a simple data set: 1, 2, 3. The mean is 2, and the variance is [(1-2)² + (2-2)² + (3-2)²]/3 = (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 2/3. Now, if we apply the transformation y = 3x - 2, the new data set is 1, 4, 7. The new mean is (1 + 4 + 7)/3 = 12/3 = 4. The deviations from the mean are (1-4) = -3, (4-4)=0, (7-4)=3. Squaring these gives 9, 0, 9. The variance is (9 + 0 + 9)/3 = 18/3 = 6. The original variance was 2/3, and 3 squared is 9, so 9*(2/3) is indeed 6. That checks out.So, applying this to the problem at hand, since the original variance is 4, multiplying each term by 3 increases the variance by 9, giving 36. Subtracting 2 doesn't change it. Therefore, the variance of the transformed numbers is 36.I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key points are understanding how linear transformations affect variance and remembering that only the scaling factor affects variance, while the constant shift doesn't. It's also helpful to test it with a simple example to confirm.**Final Answer**The variance of the transformed numbers is boxed{36}."},{"question":"On graph paper, a stepwise right triangle was drawn with legs equal to 6 cells each. Then, all grid lines inside the triangle were outlined. What is the maximum number of rectangles that can be found in this drawing?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a stepwise right triangle was drawn on graph paper with legs equal to 6 cells each. Then, all the grid lines inside the triangle were outlined. I need to find the maximum number of rectangles that can be found in this drawing. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.First, a right triangle with legs of 6 cells each. So, if I imagine graph paper, the triangle would have its right angle at the origin, and the legs would extend 6 units along the x-axis and y-axis. Since it's stepwise, I think that means it's made up of small squares, each one cell, connected in a step-like manner. So, each step would be a square, and the triangle would be built up from these squares.Wait, actually, if it's a right triangle with legs of 6 cells, then the hypotenuse would be the line connecting (6,0) to (0,6). But since it's stepwise, maybe it's constructed by connecting points along the grid lines, creating a series of small right triangles or squares? Hmm, I might need to clarify that.But perhaps it's more straightforward. Maybe it's a right triangle where each leg is divided into 6 equal segments, each of one cell length. So, the triangle is divided into smaller right triangles, each with legs of 1 cell. But then, the grid lines inside the triangle are outlined. So, we have a grid of lines inside the triangle, forming a sort of triangular lattice.Wait, but the question is about rectangles. So, in this grid, how many rectangles can we find? Hmm. Normally, in a rectangular grid, the number of rectangles is calculated by choosing two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, which form a rectangle. But in a triangular grid, it's a bit different because the lines aren't all horizontal and vertical; they might be at 45 degrees or something.Wait, hold on. Maybe the triangle is actually a square grid that's been cut along the diagonal, making a right triangle. So, if the original square grid is 6x6, then the triangle would have 6 cells along each leg, and the grid lines inside would form a sort of stepped pattern.Yes, that makes sense. So, the triangle is essentially half of a 6x6 grid, with the hypotenuse being the diagonal from (0,6) to (6,0). So, inside this triangle, the grid lines are outlined, meaning both the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines are drawn? Or just the horizontal and vertical?Wait, the problem says \\"all grid lines inside the triangle were outlined.\\" So, in the original square grid, the grid lines are horizontal and vertical. When we take the triangle, we still have horizontal and vertical grid lines inside it, but the diagonal is the hypotenuse. So, the grid lines inside the triangle are just the horizontal and vertical lines that lie within the triangle.So, in that case, the figure is a right triangle with legs of 6 units, divided into 1x1 cells, with grid lines only horizontal and vertical, not the diagonals. So, to find the number of rectangles, we need to consider the horizontal and vertical lines inside this triangle.But wait, in a triangle, the number of horizontal and vertical lines is not uniform. For example, at the base, which is the x-axis from (0,0) to (6,0), there are 6 cells. Then, as we go up each unit, the number of cells decreases by one. So, at y=1, the horizontal line would go from (0,1) to (5,1), which is 5 cells. Similarly, at y=2, it's from (0,2) to (4,2), which is 4 cells, and so on until y=6, which is just a single cell at (0,6).Similarly, the vertical lines would go from (x,0) up to (x,6 - x), since the hypotenuse is at x + y = 6. So, for each x from 0 to 6, the vertical line at x goes up to y = 6 - x.So, in this setup, how do we count the number of rectangles? Normally, in a full grid, the number of rectangles is calculated by choosing two vertical lines and two horizontal lines. The number of rectangles is then the combination of vertical lines taken two at a time multiplied by the combination of horizontal lines taken two at a time.But in this case, since it's a triangle, the number of vertical and horizontal lines varies depending on the position. So, we can't just use the standard formula. Instead, we need to find a way to count all possible rectangles within this triangular grid.Let me think. A rectangle is defined by its top, bottom, left, and right sides. So, in this grid, each rectangle must have its top and bottom sides as horizontal grid lines and its left and right sides as vertical grid lines.But in the triangle, the horizontal lines are of different lengths. So, for a rectangle to exist, the horizontal lines it uses must span from some x1 to x2, and the vertical lines must span from some y1 to y2, such that the intersection points (x1,y1), (x2,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y2) all lie within the triangle.Wait, but in the triangle, the horizontal lines at each y level have different lengths. So, for each y, the horizontal line goes from x=0 to x=6 - y. Similarly, each vertical line at x goes from y=0 to y=6 - x.So, to form a rectangle, we need two horizontal lines and two vertical lines such that their intersection points are all within the triangle.Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a grid where each row has a certain number of cells, decreasing as we go up, and each column has a certain number of cells, decreasing as we go to the right.So, perhaps we can think of this as a kind of stepped grid, where each row has one less cell than the row below it, and each column has one less cell than the column to its left.In such a grid, the number of rectangles can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of two horizontal lines and two vertical lines that form a rectangle. But because the grid is not uniform, we have to adjust our counting accordingly.Let me try to approach this step by step.First, let's consider the horizontal lines. There are 7 horizontal lines (including the base) at y=0, y=1, ..., y=6. Similarly, there are 7 vertical lines at x=0, x=1, ..., x=6.But each horizontal line at y=k has a length of (6 - k) cells. So, the number of vertical units (i.e., the number of vertical lines) that intersect with this horizontal line is (6 - k + 1). Similarly, each vertical line at x=k has a length of (6 - k) cells, so the number of horizontal units (i.e., the number of horizontal lines) that intersect with this vertical line is (6 - k + 1).Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let's think differently.In the full grid, the number of rectangles is given by (n+1 choose 2) * (m+1 choose 2), where n and m are the number of rows and columns. But in our case, it's a triangular grid, so it's not a full grid.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a grid where each row has a decreasing number of cells. So, row 0 (the base) has 6 cells, row 1 has 5 cells, row 2 has 4 cells, and so on up to row 6, which has 1 cell.Similarly, each column x has (6 - x) cells. So, column 0 has 6 cells, column 1 has 5 cells, ..., column 6 has 1 cell.In such a grid, the number of rectangles can be calculated by considering all possible pairs of rows and columns that can form the top, bottom, left, and right sides of a rectangle.Wait, but in a non-uniform grid, the number of rectangles isn't straightforward. Maybe we can use the concept of counting rectangles in a grid with varying row and column lengths.I recall that in a grid where each row has a certain number of cells, the number of rectangles can be calculated by summing over all possible pairs of rows and columns.Specifically, for each pair of horizontal lines (top and bottom), we can determine the number of vertical lines that span between them, and then compute the number of rectangles between those two horizontal lines.Similarly, for each pair of vertical lines (left and right), we can determine the number of horizontal lines that span between them, and compute the number of rectangles between those two vertical lines.But I think it's more efficient to approach this by considering each possible rectangle's height and width.Wait, another approach: The number of rectangles in a grid is equal to the sum over all possible heights and widths of the number of positions where such a rectangle can fit.In our case, since the grid is triangular, the number of positions for a rectangle of a certain height and width depends on where it is placed.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a grid where each cell is identified by its row and column, but the grid is only defined for cells where row + column <= 6.Wait, that might be a useful way to think about it. So, each cell is at position (i, j) where i is the row number (starting from 0 at the top) and j is the column number (starting from 0 at the left). But in our case, the triangle is such that for each row i, the number of cells is (6 - i). So, the cells are where i + j <= 6.Wait, actually, if we consider the triangle with legs along the x and y axes, then each cell is at position (x, y) where x and y are integers such that x + y <= 6.So, the grid is a set of points (x, y) where x and y are integers from 0 to 6, and x + y <= 6.In this case, the number of rectangles is the number of axis-aligned rectangles that can be formed within this set of points.An axis-aligned rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (x1, y1) and top-right corner (x2, y2), where x2 > x1 and y2 > y1, and all four corners are within the set.So, to count the number of rectangles, we need to count all possible pairs of (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) such that x1 < x2, y1 < y2, and x2 + y2 <= 6.Wait, but actually, since the grid is a right triangle, the condition is that x2 + y2 <= 6, but also x1 + y1 <= 6, and x2 + y1 <= 6, and x1 + y2 <= 6.Wait, no, actually, the rectangle must lie entirely within the triangle. So, all four corners must satisfy x + y <= 6.Therefore, for a rectangle with bottom-left corner (x1, y1) and top-right corner (x2, y2), we must have:x1 < x2,y1 < y2,x2 + y2 <= 6,x1 + y2 <= 6,x2 + y1 <= 6,x1 + y1 <= 6.But since x1 < x2 and y1 < y2, the last condition is automatically satisfied if the others are.So, the key conditions are:1. x2 + y2 <= 6,2. x1 + y2 <= 6,3. x2 + y1 <= 6.So, given that, how can we count the number of such rectangles?Perhaps we can iterate over all possible x1, x2, y1, y2 and count the number of valid rectangles.But that might be too time-consuming. Maybe we can find a formula or a combinatorial approach.Alternatively, let's consider that in order to form a rectangle, we need two distinct x-coordinates and two distinct y-coordinates such that the rectangle they form is entirely within the triangle.So, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of ways to choose two x-coordinates and two y-coordinates such that the rectangle defined by them is inside the triangle.So, let's denote the x-coordinates as x1 and x2, with x1 < x2, and y-coordinates as y1 and y2, with y1 < y2.We need to ensure that:x2 + y2 <= 6,x1 + y2 <= 6,x2 + y1 <= 6.So, for given x1 and x2, what is the range of y1 and y2 such that these conditions are satisfied?Alternatively, for given y1 and y2, what is the range of x1 and x2?This seems complicated, but maybe we can fix x1 and x2 first and then find the possible y1 and y2.Let me try that.Suppose we fix x1 and x2, where 0 <= x1 < x2 <=6.Then, for these x1 and x2, we need to find the number of pairs y1 and y2 such that:y1 < y2,y2 <= 6 - x2,y2 <= 6 - x1,y1 <= 6 - x2,y1 <= 6 - x1.Wait, let's see:From condition x2 + y2 <=6, we get y2 <=6 -x2.From condition x1 + y2 <=6, we get y2 <=6 -x1.Similarly, from x2 + y1 <=6, we get y1 <=6 -x2.From x1 + y1 <=6, we get y1 <=6 -x1.But since x1 < x2, 6 -x1 >6 -x2.So, the stricter condition is y2 <=6 -x2 and y1 <=6 -x2.But y1 must be less than y2, so y1 can range from 0 up to y2 -1, but y2 is at most 6 -x2.Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as for given x1 and x2, the maximum y2 is min(6 -x1, 6 -x2). But since x1 <x2, 6 -x1 >6 -x2, so min is 6 -x2. So, y2 can go up to 6 -x2.Similarly, y1 can go up to 6 -x2 as well, but y1 must be less than y2.So, for given x1 and x2, the number of possible y1 and y2 is the number of pairs where y1 < y2 <=6 -x2.Which is equal to C(6 -x2 +1, 2). Because y2 can be from 1 to 6 -x2, and y1 can be from 0 to y2 -1.Wait, actually, the number of pairs (y1, y2) with y1 < y2 <= N is C(N +1, 2). Because y2 can be from 1 to N, and for each y2, y1 can be from 0 to y2 -1, which is y2 choices. So, total is sum_{y2=1}^N y2 = N(N+1)/2 = C(N+1, 2).But in our case, N is 6 -x2.So, the number of y pairs is C(6 -x2 +1, 2) = C(7 -x2, 2).Therefore, for each pair x1 <x2, the number of rectangles is C(7 -x2, 2).But wait, is that correct? Let me check.Suppose x2 is fixed, say x2=3. Then, 6 -x2=3, so y2 can be up to 3. Then, the number of y pairs is C(4,2)=6.Which would correspond to y2=1, y1=0; y2=2, y1=0,1; y2=3, y1=0,1,2. So, total 1+2+3=6, which is correct.So, yes, for each x2, the number of y pairs is C(7 -x2, 2).But wait, does x1 affect this? Because we fixed x1 and x2, but in the above reasoning, x1 only affects the upper bound on y2 through 6 -x1, but since 6 -x1 >6 -x2, the limiting factor is 6 -x2.Therefore, for each x2, regardless of x1, as long as x1 <x2, the number of y pairs is C(7 -x2, 2).But wait, that can't be, because x1 also affects the maximum y1 and y2.Wait, no, actually, for a given x1 and x2, the maximum y2 is 6 -x2, as 6 -x1 is larger, so it doesn't impose a stricter condition. Similarly, y1 can go up to 6 -x2 as well.Therefore, for each x1 <x2, the number of y pairs is C(7 -x2, 2).But wait, that would mean that for each x2, the number of rectangles contributed by all x1 <x2 is (x2) * C(7 -x2, 2). Because x1 can be from 0 to x2 -1, which is x2 choices.Wait, no, actually, for each x2, the number of x1 is x2 (since x1 can be 0,1,...,x2 -1). For each such x1, the number of y pairs is C(7 -x2, 2). So, total rectangles for a given x2 is x2 * C(7 -x2, 2).Therefore, the total number of rectangles is the sum over x2 from 1 to 6 of [x2 * C(7 -x2, 2)].Wait, let's test this with x2=1.x2=1: x1 can be 0. Number of y pairs is C(6, 2)=15. So, total rectangles: 1*15=15.x2=2: x1 can be 0,1. Number of y pairs is C(5,2)=10. So, total rectangles: 2*10=20.x2=3: x1=0,1,2. y pairs=C(4,2)=6. Total:3*6=18.x2=4: x1=0,1,2,3. y pairs=C(3,2)=3. Total:4*3=12.x2=5: x1=0,1,2,3,4. y pairs=C(2,2)=1. Total:5*1=5.x2=6: x1=0,1,2,3,4,5. y pairs=C(1,2)=0, since C(1,2)=0. So, total:6*0=0.So, total rectangles would be 15+20+18+12+5+0=70.Wait, so the total number of rectangles is 70?But let me think again. Is this correct?Wait, when x2=6, y pairs would be C(1,2)=0, which makes sense because y2 can only be up to 0, which is not possible since y2 must be at least y1 +1. So, no rectangles for x2=6.Similarly, for x2=5, y2 can be up to 1, so y pairs are C(2,2)=1, which is correct: y1=0, y2=1.So, the calculation seems correct.Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 15+20+18+12+5=70.Wait, but let me cross-verify this with another approach.Another way to think about this is that in the triangular grid, each rectangle is determined by choosing two distinct x-coordinates and two distinct y-coordinates such that the rectangle lies entirely within the triangle.So, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of such quadruples (x1, x2, y1, y2) with x1 <x2, y1 <y2, and x2 + y2 <=6.So, we can model this as counting the number of 2x2 subgrids within the triangular grid.Alternatively, perhaps we can use combinatorics.Let me consider that for each possible width w and height h, the number of rectangles of size w x h is equal to the number of positions where such a rectangle can fit.In our case, the width w is the difference x2 -x1, and the height h is y2 -y1.But since the grid is triangular, the number of positions for a rectangle of size w x h depends on w and h.Wait, perhaps for a rectangle of width w and height h, the number of positions is equal to the number of x1 such that x1 + w <=6 - y1, and similarly for y1.But this seems complicated.Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the number of rectangles in a grid where each row has a certain number of cells.I found a resource that says the number of rectangles in a grid with m rows and n columns is m*n*(m+1)*(n+1)/4. But that's for a full grid.Wait, no, actually, the standard formula is (m choose 2)*(n choose 2). So, for m rows and n columns, it's C(m,2)*C(n,2).But in our case, it's a triangular grid, so it's not a full grid.Wait, perhaps we can model this as a grid where each row has a decreasing number of cells, and each column has a decreasing number of cells.I found a similar problem online where the number of rectangles in a right triangular grid is calculated as the sum from i=1 to n of sum from j=1 to n of (n - i +1)(n - j +1) - but I'm not sure.Wait, no, that might not be correct.Alternatively, perhaps we can think of the grid as a combination of smaller grids.Wait, another approach: The number of rectangles in the triangle is equal to the number of rectangles in the full 6x6 grid minus the number of rectangles that lie entirely above the diagonal.But that might not be straightforward because the diagonal cuts through the grid, so some rectangles would be partially above and partially below.Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the number of rectangles in the triangle is equal to the sum from k=1 to 6 of the number of rectangles in each row.But each row has a different number of cells.Wait, actually, in the triangle, each row y has (6 - y) cells. So, the number of rectangles that have their base on row y is C(6 - y, 2). But that's only for rectangles that are 1 unit high.Wait, no, actually, for each row y, the number of rectangles that span from row y to row y + h is C(6 - y - h +1, 2).Wait, this is getting too convoluted.Wait, let's go back to the initial approach where we fixed x2 and calculated the number of rectangles for each x2. We got a total of 70 rectangles.But let me check with a smaller case to see if this approach is correct.Suppose the triangle has legs of 2 cells each. So, it's a smaller triangle.Using the same method:For x2=1: x1=0. y pairs=C(6 -1,2)=C(5,2)=10? Wait, no, wait, in the smaller case, 6 would be 2.Wait, actually, in the original problem, the legs are 6 cells, so in the smaller case, legs are 2 cells.So, for legs=2:x2 can be 1 and 2.For x2=1: x1=0. y pairs=C(2 -1 +1,2)=C(2,2)=1.So, total rectangles:1*1=1.For x2=2: x1=0,1. y pairs=C(2 -2 +1,2)=C(1,2)=0.So, total rectangles:2*0=0.Total rectangles=1+0=1.But in reality, in a 2x2 triangle, how many rectangles are there?Let me visualize it.The triangle has 3 horizontal lines: y=0 (2 cells), y=1 (1 cell), y=2 (0 cells).Similarly, vertical lines: x=0 (2 cells), x=1 (1 cell), x=2 (0 cells).So, the grid points are:(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)(0,1), (1,1)(0,2)So, the rectangles are:- The unit square at (0,0) to (1,1). So, only 1 rectangle.Which matches our calculation of 1.So, the method works for n=2.Another test case: n=3.Using the same method:x2 can be 1,2,3.For x2=1: x1=0. y pairs=C(3 -1 +1,2)=C(3,2)=3.So, total rectangles:1*3=3.For x2=2: x1=0,1. y pairs=C(3 -2 +1,2)=C(2,2)=1.Total rectangles:2*1=2.For x2=3: x1=0,1,2. y pairs=C(3 -3 +1,2)=C(1,2)=0.Total rectangles:3*0=0.Total rectangles=3+2+0=5.Now, let's count manually.In a 3x3 triangle, the grid points are:(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)(0,2), (1,2)(0,3)So, the rectangles are:1x1: There are several.At the base:- (0,0)-(1,1)- (1,0)-(2,1)- (2,0)-(3,1)But wait, (3,0) can't form a rectangle because there's no cell above it.Wait, actually, in the triangle, the top row is y=3, which is just (0,3). So, the rectangles are:- (0,0)-(1,1)- (1,0)-(2,1)- (2,0)-(3,1)- (0,1)-(1,2)- (1,1)-(2,2)So, total 5 rectangles, which matches our calculation.Therefore, the method seems to be correct.So, returning to our original problem with n=6, the total number of rectangles is 70.Wait, but let me check with another approach.Another way to think about it is that the number of rectangles in such a triangular grid is equal to the sum from k=1 to n of k*(k+1)*(2k+1)/8, but I'm not sure.Wait, actually, I found a formula online that the number of rectangles in a right triangular grid of size n is n(n+1)(n+2)(3n+1)/24.But let me test this formula with n=2.n=2: 2*3*4*7/24= 168/24=7. But we know that for n=2, the number of rectangles is 1. So, this formula is incorrect.Wait, maybe it's another formula.Alternatively, perhaps the number of rectangles is equal to the sum from i=1 to n of sum from j=1 to n of (n - i +1)(n - j +1) - but that seems too large.Wait, no, in our initial approach, for n=6, we got 70 rectangles.Wait, let me check with n=3, which gave us 5 rectangles.Using the formula from the initial approach:Sum over x2=1 to 3 of [x2 * C(4 -x2, 2)].Wait, for n=3, 6 -x2 would be 3 -x2 +1?Wait, no, in the original problem, it was 6 -x2, but for n=3, it should be 3 -x2.Wait, maybe I confused the variables.Wait, in the original problem, the legs are 6 cells, so the formula was x2 * C(7 -x2, 2). For n=3, it would be x2 * C(4 -x2, 2).So, for n=3:x2=1: 1*C(3,2)=3x2=2:2*C(2,2)=2x2=3:3*C(1,2)=0Total=3+2+0=5, which matches.Similarly, for n=2:x2=1:1*C(2,2)=1x2=2:2*C(1,2)=0Total=1+0=1, which matches.So, the formula seems to hold.Therefore, for n=6, the total number of rectangles is 70.Wait, but let me compute it step by step again to be sure.For x2=1:x1=0. y pairs=C(6,2)=15.Rectangles:1*15=15.x2=2:x1=0,1. y pairs=C(5,2)=10.Rectangles:2*10=20.x2=3:x1=0,1,2. y pairs=C(4,2)=6.Rectangles:3*6=18.x2=4:x1=0,1,2,3. y pairs=C(3,2)=3.Rectangles:4*3=12.x2=5:x1=0,1,2,3,4. y pairs=C(2,2)=1.Rectangles:5*1=5.x2=6:x1=0,1,2,3,4,5. y pairs=C(1,2)=0.Rectangles:6*0=0.Total:15+20=35; 35+18=53; 53+12=65; 65+5=70; 70+0=70.Yes, that's consistent.Therefore, the maximum number of rectangles that can be found in this drawing is 70.**Final Answer**The maximum number of rectangles is boxed{70}."},{"question":"Screws are sold in packs of  10  and  12 . Harry and Sam independently go to the hardware store, and by coincidence each of them buys exactly  k  screws. However, the number of packs of screws Harry buys is different than the number of packs Sam buys. What is the smallest possible value of  k ?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where screws are sold in packs of 10 and 12. Harry and Sam each buy exactly k screws, but they buy different numbers of packs. I need to find the smallest possible value of k where this can happen. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.First, let's understand what it means for Harry and Sam to buy k screws. Since screws come in packs of 10 and 12, both Harry and Sam must have bought some combination of these packs to reach exactly k screws. However, the total number of packs Harry buys is different from the number Sam buys. So, even though they both end up with k screws, the number of packs they purchased isn't the same.So, essentially, we're looking for the smallest k such that there are two different pairs of non-negative integers (a, b) and (c, d) where a + b ≠ c + d, and 10a + 12b = 10c + 12d = k. That makes sense.Let me write this out more formally. Let’s denote the number of 10-packs Harry buys as a and the number of 12-packs as b. Similarly, for Sam, let’s say he buys c 10-packs and d 12-packs. Then, we have:10a + 12b = k  10c + 12d = kAnd the total number of packs Harry buys is a + b, while for Sam it's c + d. The condition is that a + b ≠ c + d.So, we need to find the smallest k where such a, b, c, d exist.I think the way to approach this is to look for numbers k that can be expressed as a combination of 10s and 12s in more than one way, with different total numbers of packs. So, k must have multiple representations as 10a + 12b, where the sum a + b is different for each representation.Let me start by listing the possible values of k and see when this condition is met.Starting from k=10:- 10 can be expressed as 10*1 + 12*0. Total packs: 1. There's no other way, so k=10 is out.k=12:- 12 can be expressed as 10*0 + 12*1. Total packs:1. Again, only one way.k=20:- 10*2 + 12*0. Total packs:2- 10*0 + 12*1.666... Not an integer, so only one way.Wait, 12*1.666 isn't valid because you can't buy a fraction of a pack. So, k=20 can only be expressed as 10*2. So, only one way.k=24:- 10*0 + 12*2. Total packs:2- 10* something? 24-10=14, which isn't divisible by 12. 24-20=4, also not divisible by 12. So, only one way.k=30:- 10*3 + 12*0. Total packs:3- 10*1 + 12*1.666... Not integer. 10*2 + 12* (30-20)/12=10/12, which isn't integer. So, only one way.Wait, 30-12=18, which isn't divisible by 10. 30-24=6, not divisible by 10. So, only one way.k=36:- 10*0 + 12*3. Total packs:3- 10* something: 36-10=26, not divisible by 12. 36-20=16, not divisible by 12. 36-30=6, not divisible by 12. So, only one way.k=40:- 10*4 + 12*0. Total packs:4- 10*2 + 12*1.666... Not integer. 10*1 + 12*(40-10)/12=30/12=2.5, not integer. 10*3 + 12*(40-30)/12=10/12, not integer. So, only one way.k=48:- 10*0 + 12*4. Total packs:4- 10* something: 48-10=38, not divisible by 12. 48-20=28, not divisible by 12. 48-30=18, which is 12*1.5, not integer. 48-40=8, not divisible by 12. So, only one way.Hmm, this is taking a while. Maybe I need a better approach than just listing each k.Let me think algebraically. Let's suppose that k can be expressed as 10a + 12b and also as 10c + 12d, where a + b ≠ c + d.So, 10a + 12b = 10c + 12d  Which simplifies to 10(a - c) = 12(d - b)  Divide both sides by 2: 5(a - c) = 6(d - b)So, 5 divides the right side, which is 6(d - b). Since 5 and 6 are coprime, 5 must divide (d - b). Let’s denote d - b = 5m, where m is an integer.Similarly, substituting back, 5(a - c) = 6*5m  So, a - c = 6mTherefore, we have:a = c + 6m  d = b + 5mSince a, b, c, d are non-negative integers, m must be chosen such that a, c, d, b remain non-negative.So, m can be positive or negative, but we need to ensure that a, c, d, b are all non-negative.Let’s consider m=1 first.Then, a = c + 6  d = b + 5So, if m=1, then a is 6 more than c, and d is 5 more than b.But since a and d are non-negative, c and b must be such that c +6 and b +5 are non-negative, which they are as long as c and b are non-negative.So, for m=1, we can have solutions where a = c +6 and d = b +5.Now, let's see if this gives us a valid k.We have k = 10a + 12b = 10(c +6) + 12b = 10c + 60 + 12b  Similarly, k = 10c + 12d = 10c + 12(b +5) = 10c + 12b + 60So, both expressions give k = 10c + 12b + 60.Therefore, k must be at least 60, since c and b are non-negative integers.Wait, but 60 is quite a large number. Maybe m can be negative?Let’s try m=-1.Then, a = c -6  d = b -5But since a and d must be non-negative, c must be at least 6 and b must be at least 5.So, let's set c=6 and b=5.Then, a=0 and d=0.So, k=10a +12b=10*0 +12*5=60  Similarly, k=10c +12d=10*6 +12*0=60So, k=60 can be expressed as 12*5 or 10*6, which are 5 packs and 6 packs respectively. So, Harry could have bought 5 packs (all 12s) and Sam could have bought 6 packs (all 10s). So, the total number of packs is different, 5 vs 6.Wait, so k=60 is a candidate. But is 60 the smallest such k?Wait, earlier when I was listing k, I didn't get to 60 yet, but maybe there is a smaller k where this can happen.Wait, let's think again. Maybe m=1 gives k=60, but m=-1 also gives k=60. So, is there a way to get a smaller k?Wait, let's think about the equation again: 5(a - c) = 6(d - b). So, the minimal solution is when m=1 or m=-1, leading to k=60. But perhaps there are other solutions where m is a fraction? Wait, no, m has to be integer because a, c, d, b are integers.Alternatively, maybe there are other solutions where m is not 1 or -1, but still gives a smaller k.Wait, let's think about the equation 5(a - c) = 6(d - b). So, 5 divides the right side, which is 6(d - b). Since 5 and 6 are coprime, 5 must divide (d - b). So, d - b must be a multiple of 5, say 5m. Similarly, a - c must be a multiple of 6, say 6m.Therefore, the minimal non-zero m is 1 or -1, leading to the minimal k=60.But wait, maybe there's a smaller k where the number of packs differs, but the equation 5(a - c)=6(d - b) is satisfied with smaller numbers.Wait, let's think differently. Maybe instead of looking for k where two different combinations of packs give the same total with different numbers of packs, perhaps we can look for k that can be expressed as 10a +12b in two different ways, with a + b ≠ c + d.So, let's try to find such k.Let me list the possible k values and their pack combinations:k=10: 10*1 +12*0 (1 pack)k=12: 10*0 +12*1 (1 pack)k=20: 10*2 +12*0 (2 packs)k=24: 10*0 +12*2 (2 packs)k=30: 10*3 +12*0 (3 packs)k=36: 10*0 +12*3 (3 packs)k=40: 10*4 +12*0 (4 packs)k=48: 10*0 +12*4 (4 packs)k=50: 10*5 +12*0 (5 packs), 10*3 +12*1 (3+1=4 packs)Wait, hold on. At k=50, we have two different combinations: 5 packs of 10, or 3 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12, which is 4 packs total. So, here, Harry could have bought 5 packs, and Sam bought 4 packs, both totaling 50 screws. So, k=50 seems to satisfy the condition.Wait, so is 50 the minimal k? Because earlier, I thought it was 60, but maybe 50 is smaller.Wait, let me check k=50.Harry buys 5 packs of 10: 5*10=50  Sam buys 3 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12: 3*10 +1*12=30+12=42. Wait, that's 42, not 50. Wait, did I miscalculate?Wait, 3 packs of 10 is 30, plus 1 pack of 12 is 12, so total is 42, not 50. So, that's incorrect.Wait, so maybe k=50 can't be expressed as 10a +12b in two different ways with different total packs.Wait, let me recast that.Wait, 50 divided by 10 is 5, so 5 packs of 10. Alternatively, 50 divided by 12 is 4 with a remainder of 2, which isn't a multiple of 10. So, 50-12=38, which isn't divisible by 10. 50-24=26, not divisible by 10. 50-36=14, not divisible by 10. 50-48=2, not divisible by 10. So, actually, 50 can only be expressed as 5 packs of 10. So, my earlier thought was wrong.So, k=50 can't be expressed in two different ways. So, scratch that.Let me try k=60 again.60 can be expressed as 6 packs of 10 (6*10=60) or 5 packs of 12 (5*12=60). So, that's two different combinations with different total packs (6 vs 5). So, k=60 works.But is there a smaller k?Let me check k=40.40 can be expressed as 4 packs of 10 (4*10=40) or 2 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12: 2*10 +1*12=20+12=32. Wait, that's 32, not 40. 40-12=28, which isn't divisible by 10. 40-24=16, not divisible by 10. 40-36=4, not divisible by 10. So, only one way.k=30: 3 packs of 10 or 1 pack of 10 and 1 pack of 12: 10 +12=22, which isn't 30. 30-12=18, not divisible by 10. 30-24=6, not divisible by 10. So, only one way.k=24: 2 packs of 12 or 0 packs of 10 and 2 packs of 12. Wait, that's the same as 2 packs. Alternatively, 24-10=14, not divisible by 12. 24-20=4, not divisible by 12. So, only one way.k=20: 2 packs of 10 or 0 packs of 10 and 1.666 packs of 12, which isn't valid. So, only one way.k=12: 1 pack of 12 or 0 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12. Only one way.k=10: 1 pack of 10. Only one way.So, up to k=60, the only k that can be expressed in two different ways with different total packs is k=60.Wait, but earlier, I thought k=50 might work, but it didn't. Let me check k=36.36 can be expressed as 3 packs of 12 or 0 packs of 10 and 3 packs of 12. Alternatively, 36-10=26, not divisible by 12. 36-20=16, not divisible by 12. 36-30=6, not divisible by 12. So, only one way.k=48: 4 packs of 12 or 0 packs of 10 and 4 packs of 12. Alternatively, 48-10=38, not divisible by 12. 48-20=28, not divisible by 12. 48-30=18, which is 12*1.5, not integer. 48-40=8, not divisible by 12. So, only one way.Hmm, so k=60 seems to be the first k where this happens.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a smaller k where the number of packs differs, but the equation is satisfied with different a, b, c, d.Wait, let's think of k=24. If Harry buys 2 packs of 12 (total 24), and Sam buys 3 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12, but 3*10 +1*12=42, which is more than 24. So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe k=30. If Harry buys 3 packs of 10, and Sam buys 1 pack of 10 and 2 packs of 12: 10 +24=34, which is more than 30. So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe k=40. If Harry buys 4 packs of 10, and Sam buys 2 packs of 10 and 2 packs of 12: 20 +24=44, which is more than 40. So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe k=50. If Harry buys 5 packs of 10, and Sam buys 3 packs of 10 and 2 packs of 12: 30 +24=54, which is more than 50. So, that's not possible.Wait, maybe k=60 is indeed the smallest.But wait, let me think of another approach. Let's consider the number of packs. Let’s denote the total packs as n for Harry and m for Sam, with n ≠ m.So, we have 10a +12b =10c +12d =k  and a + b =n  c + d =m  with n ≠ m.We need to find the smallest k where such a, b, c, d exist.So, let's look for k such that k can be expressed as 10a +12b in two different ways, with a + b ≠ c + d.So, let's consider the possible combinations.Let’s list the possible k and the number of packs:For k=10: 10*1 +12*0 (1 pack)k=12: 10*0 +12*1 (1 pack)k=20: 10*2 +12*0 (2 packs)k=24: 10*0 +12*2 (2 packs)k=30: 10*3 +12*0 (3 packs)k=36: 10*0 +12*3 (3 packs)k=40: 10*4 +12*0 (4 packs)k=48: 10*0 +12*4 (4 packs)k=50: 10*5 +12*0 (5 packs)k=60: 10*6 +12*0 (6 packs) or 10*0 +12*5 (5 packs)So, at k=60, we have two different combinations: 6 packs of 10 or 5 packs of 12. So, Harry could have bought 6 packs, and Sam bought 5 packs, both totaling 60 screws.Is there a smaller k where this happens?Wait, let me check k=30. If Harry buys 3 packs of 10 (30 screws), and Sam buys 1 pack of 10 and 1 pack of 12, which is 22 screws. That's not 30. So, no.k=40: Harry buys 4 packs of 10 (40 screws), Sam buys 2 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (32 screws). Not 40.k=50: Harry buys 5 packs of 10 (50 screws), Sam buys 3 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (42 screws). Not 50.k=60: Harry buys 6 packs of 10 (60 screws), Sam buys 5 packs of 12 (60 screws). So, that works.Wait, but earlier, when I thought of k=50, I thought it might work, but it doesn't because 3 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12 only give 42, not 50.Wait, let me check k=60 again. 6 packs of 10 is 60, and 5 packs of 12 is 60. So, that works.Is there a smaller k where this happens?Wait, let me think of k=24. 2 packs of 12 (24 screws). If Sam buys 1 pack of 10 and 1 pack of 12, that's 22 screws, which is less than 24. So, no.k=36: 3 packs of 12 (36 screws). If Sam buys 3 packs of 10 and 0 packs of 12, that's 30 screws, which is less than 36. So, no.k=48: 4 packs of 12 (48 screws). If Sam buys 4 packs of 10 and 0 packs of 12, that's 40 screws, which is less than 48. So, no.k=60: 6 packs of 10 or 5 packs of 12. Both give 60.So, it seems that k=60 is the smallest such number.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a k less than 60 where the number of packs differs, but the combination isn't just all 10s or all 12s.For example, maybe k=24 can be expressed as 2 packs of 12, or 1 pack of 10 and 1 pack of 12, but 10 +12=22, which is less than 24. So, no.k=30: 3 packs of 10, or 1 pack of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (22), which is less. So, no.k=40: 4 packs of 10, or 2 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (32), which is less. So, no.k=50: 5 packs of 10, or 3 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (42), which is less. So, no.k=60: 6 packs of 10 or 5 packs of 12. Both give 60.So, yes, k=60 is the smallest.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a k where both Harry and Sam buy a mix of 10s and 12s, but with different total packs.For example, let's say k=24. Harry buys 2 packs of 12 (2 packs). Sam buys 0 packs of 10 and 2 packs of 12 (same as Harry). So, same number of packs. Not different.k=36: 3 packs of 12. If Sam buys 1 pack of 10 and 2 packs of 12: 10 +24=34, which is less than 36. So, no.k=48: 4 packs of 12. If Sam buys 2 packs of 10 and 2 packs of 12: 20 +24=44, which is less than 48. So, no.k=60: 6 packs of 10 or 5 packs of 12. So, different total packs.Wait, but what about k=120? That's 12 packs of 10 or 10 packs of 12. But that's larger than 60, so 60 is still smaller.Wait, maybe k=60 is indeed the smallest.But let me think of another way. Let's consider the equation 10a +12b =10c +12d, which simplifies to 10(a - c)=12(d - b). As before, this leads to 5(a - c)=6(d - b). So, the minimal solution is when a - c=6 and d - b=5, leading to k=60.Alternatively, if a - c= -6 and d - b= -5, which would also give k=60, but with c= a +6 and b= d +5, which would require a and d to be at least 6 and 5 respectively, leading to the same k=60.Therefore, the minimal k is 60.Wait, but earlier, I thought of k=50, but it didn't work. So, yes, k=60 is the smallest.But wait, let me check k=24 again. If Harry buys 2 packs of 12 (24 screws), and Sam buys 1 pack of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (22 screws). That's not 24. So, no.Wait, maybe k=30. Harry buys 3 packs of 10 (30 screws). Sam buys 1 pack of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (22 screws). Not 30.Wait, maybe k=40. Harry buys 4 packs of 10 (40 screws). Sam buys 2 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (32 screws). Not 40.Wait, maybe k=50. Harry buys 5 packs of 10 (50 screws). Sam buys 3 packs of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (42 screws). Not 50.So, yes, k=60 is the smallest.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a k where both Harry and Sam buy a mix of 10s and 12s, but with different total packs.For example, let's say k=24. Harry buys 2 packs of 12 (2 packs). Sam buys 1 pack of 10 and 1 pack of 12 (2 packs). So, same number of packs. Not different.k=36: Harry buys 3 packs of 12 (3 packs). Sam buys 1 pack of 10 and 2 packs of 12 (3 packs). Same number of packs.k=48: Harry buys 4 packs of 12 (4 packs). Sam buys 2 packs of 10 and 2 packs of 12 (4 packs). Same number of packs.k=60: Harry buys 6 packs of 10 (6 packs). Sam buys 5 packs of 12 (5 packs). Different number of packs.So, yes, k=60 is the smallest.Wait, but let me think of another angle. Maybe k=60 is the least common multiple of 10 and 12, which is 60. So, that makes sense.Therefore, the smallest possible value of k is 60.**Final Answer**The smallest possible value of ( k ) is (boxed{60})."},{"question":"Let S_n be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n}. Given that a_1 = 2 and S_n = a_{n+1} (for n in mathbb{N}^*), find the value of a_4.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of ( a_4 ) in a sequence. The problem says that ( S_n ) is the sum of the first ( n ) terms of the sequence ( {a_n} ). It also gives me that ( a_1 = 2 ) and ( S_n = a_{n+1} ) for any natural number ( n ). Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me recall what ( S_n ) represents. It's the sum of the first ( n ) terms of the sequence. So, ( S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + dots + a_n ). Got that. Now, the problem tells me that ( S_n = a_{n+1} ). So, each term ( a_{n+1} ) is equal to the sum of all the previous terms up to ( a_n ). Interesting.Given that ( a_1 = 2 ), I can start by computing ( S_1 ). Since ( S_1 ) is just the first term, ( S_1 = a_1 = 2 ). According to the given relation, ( S_1 = a_{2} ). So, ( a_2 = 2 ). That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to ( S_2 ). ( S_2 ) is the sum of the first two terms, which is ( a_1 + a_2 ). Plugging in the known values, ( S_2 = 2 + 2 = 4 ). But since ( S_2 = a_3 ), that means ( a_3 = 4 ). Okay, so far so good.Next, let's compute ( S_3 ). ( S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 ). Substituting the known values, ( S_3 = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 ). Therefore, ( a_4 = S_3 = 8 ). Wait, but hold on, the problem is asking for ( a_4 ), so is it 8? That seems too quick. Let me verify.Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, ( a_1 = 2 ). Then, ( S_1 = a_1 = 2 ), so ( a_2 = 2 ). Then, ( S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 4 ), so ( a_3 = 4 ). Then, ( S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 8 ), so ( a_4 = 8 ). Hmm, that seems consistent.But let me think about this a bit more deeply. Is there a pattern here? Let's list out the terms:- ( a_1 = 2 )- ( a_2 = S_1 = 2 )- ( a_3 = S_2 = 4 )- ( a_4 = S_3 = 8 )Wait a second, each term is doubling. ( 2, 2, 4, 8 ). So, starting from ( a_2 ), each term is double the previous term. Is that the case?Let me check:- ( a_2 = 2 )- ( a_3 = 4 = 2 times 2 )- ( a_4 = 8 = 2 times 4 )So, yes, starting from ( a_2 ), each term is twice the previous term. So, if this pattern continues, ( a_5 = 16 ), ( a_6 = 32 ), and so on. So, it's like a geometric sequence starting from ( a_2 ) with a common ratio of 2.But wait, ( a_1 = 2 ), ( a_2 = 2 ), so the first two terms are both 2, and then it starts doubling. So, the sequence is ( 2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, dots ). Interesting.Is there a way to express this sequence in a general formula? Maybe, but since the problem only asks for ( a_4 ), which we've already found to be 8, perhaps that's sufficient. But just to make sure, let me try to derive a general formula for ( a_n ).Given that ( S_n = a_{n+1} ), and ( S_n = a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_n ). So, ( a_{n+1} = S_n ). But also, ( S_{n} = S_{n-1} + a_n ). Therefore, substituting, ( a_{n+1} = S_{n} = S_{n-1} + a_n ). But ( S_{n-1} = a_n ), from the given relation ( S_{n-1} = a_n ). So, substituting, ( a_{n+1} = a_n + a_n = 2a_n ).Ah, so this shows that for ( n geq 2 ), ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ). Therefore, starting from ( a_2 ), each term is twice the previous term. So, this confirms the pattern I noticed earlier.Therefore, the sequence is:- ( a_1 = 2 )- ( a_2 = 2 )- ( a_3 = 2 times a_2 = 4 )- ( a_4 = 2 times a_3 = 8 )- ( a_5 = 2 times a_4 = 16 )- And so on.So, indeed, ( a_4 = 8 ). That seems consistent.But just to make sure, let me compute ( S_3 ) again. ( S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 ). Therefore, ( a_4 = S_3 = 8 ). Yep, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can use mathematical induction or another method to find a general formula for ( a_n ), but since the problem only asks for ( a_4 ), perhaps that's overkill. But just for my own understanding, let me see.We have ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ) for ( n geq 2 ). So, starting from ( a_2 = 2 ), each subsequent term is double the previous one. So, this is a geometric sequence starting at ( a_2 ) with ratio 2. So, the general term for ( n geq 2 ) is ( a_n = 2 times 2^{n-2} = 2^{n-1} ).Wait, let me test that:- For ( n = 2 ): ( 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2 ), which matches ( a_2 = 2 ).- For ( n = 3 ): ( 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4 ), which matches ( a_3 = 4 ).- For ( n = 4 ): ( 2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8 ), which matches ( a_4 = 8 ).So, yes, for ( n geq 2 ), ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ). Therefore, ( a_4 = 2^{4-1} = 8 ). That's consistent with what I found earlier.But wait, what about ( a_1 )? It's given as 2, which is ( 2^{1} ), but according to the formula ( 2^{n-1} ), ( a_1 ) would be ( 2^{0} = 1 ), which is not the case. So, the formula only applies for ( n geq 2 ). So, the sequence is:- ( a_1 = 2 )- ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) for ( n geq 2 )So, that explains why ( a_2 = 2 ), which is ( 2^{1} ), ( a_3 = 4 ), which is ( 2^{2} ), and so on.Therefore, ( a_4 = 8 ). So, I think that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me try to compute ( S_4 ) as well, just to see if the pattern continues.( S_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16 ). Therefore, ( a_5 = S_4 = 16 ), which is consistent with the formula ( a_5 = 2^{5-1} = 16 ). So, everything checks out.Alternatively, if I try to express ( S_n ) in terms of ( a_{n+1} ), since ( S_n = a_{n+1} ), and ( S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n ), which is ( a_n + a_n = 2a_n ). So, ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ) for ( n geq 1 ). Wait, hold on, is that the case?Wait, let's see:Given ( S_n = a_{n+1} ) and ( S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n ). Therefore, ( a_{n+1} = S_{n} = S_{n-1} + a_n ). But ( S_{n-1} = a_n ) from the given relation. So, substituting, ( a_{n+1} = a_n + a_n = 2a_n ). Therefore, ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ) for all ( n geq 1 ).Wait, but if ( n geq 1 ), then for ( n = 1 ), ( a_{2} = 2a_1 ). But ( a_1 = 2 ), so ( a_2 = 4 ). But earlier, we found ( a_2 = 2 ). That's a contradiction. So, something's wrong here.Wait, so maybe my earlier reasoning is flawed. Let me go back.Wait, if ( S_n = a_{n+1} ), then ( S_1 = a_2 ). ( S_1 = a_1 = 2 ), so ( a_2 = 2 ). Then, ( S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 4 ), so ( a_3 = 4 ). Then, ( S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 8 ), so ( a_4 = 8 ). So, in that case, ( a_{n+1} = S_n ).But when I tried to express ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ), that led to a contradiction because when ( n = 1 ), ( a_2 = 2a_1 = 4 ), but we know ( a_2 = 2 ). So, perhaps the recurrence ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ) only holds for ( n geq 2 ), not for ( n = 1 ).Let me check that.From ( S_n = a_{n+1} ) and ( S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n ), so ( a_{n+1} = S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n ). But ( S_{n-1} = a_n ) (since ( S_{n-1} = a_n ) for ( n geq 2 )), so substituting, ( a_{n+1} = a_n + a_n = 2a_n ).But wait, when ( n = 1 ), ( S_0 ) is undefined, right? Because ( S_n ) is defined for ( n geq 1 ). So, perhaps the recurrence ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ) only holds for ( n geq 2 ). Therefore, for ( n geq 2 ), ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ). So, that would mean that starting from ( a_2 ), each term is double the previous one.So, for ( n = 2 ), ( a_3 = 2a_2 = 4 ). For ( n = 3 ), ( a_4 = 2a_3 = 8 ). For ( n = 4 ), ( a_5 = 2a_4 = 16 ), and so on. So, that explains why ( a_2 = 2 ), ( a_3 = 4 ), ( a_4 = 8 ), etc.Therefore, the recurrence relation ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n ) is valid for ( n geq 2 ), but not for ( n = 1 ). So, ( a_2 ) is an exception because it's directly given by ( S_1 = a_2 ), which is 2, whereas if we had used the recurrence for ( n = 1 ), we would have gotten ( a_2 = 2a_1 = 4 ), which is incorrect.So, in summary, the sequence is defined as:- ( a_1 = 2 )- ( a_2 = 2 )- For ( n geq 2 ), ( a_{n+1} = 2a_n )Therefore, starting from ( a_2 ), each term is double the previous one. So, ( a_3 = 4 ), ( a_4 = 8 ), and so on.Therefore, the value of ( a_4 ) is 8.But just to make sure, let me try to compute ( a_5 ) as well. Since ( a_4 = 8 ), then ( a_5 = 2a_4 = 16 ). Then, ( S_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 16 ), which equals ( a_5 ). So, that's consistent.Alternatively, if I try to write a general formula for ( a_n ), considering the initial terms and the recurrence, it's a bit tricky because the recurrence only starts from ( n = 2 ). So, for ( n geq 2 ), ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ). But ( a_1 = 2 ), which is ( 2^1 ), so actually, ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) for all ( n geq 1 ). Wait, let's check:- ( a_1 = 2^{0} = 1 ). Wait, no, that's not correct because ( a_1 = 2 ).Wait, so maybe the formula is ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) for ( n geq 2 ), and ( a_1 = 2 ). So, it's a piecewise function.Alternatively, maybe I can adjust the formula to account for ( a_1 ). Let me see:If I consider ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) for ( n geq 1 ), then ( a_1 = 1 ), which is not the case. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, perhaps ( a_n = 2^{n} ) for ( n geq 1 ). Then, ( a_1 = 2 ), which is correct, ( a_2 = 4 ), but wait, we know ( a_2 = 2 ), so that's incorrect. So, that formula doesn't hold.Alternatively, maybe ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) for ( n geq 2 ), and ( a_1 = 2 ). So, that would be:- ( a_1 = 2 )- ( a_2 = 2^{1} = 2 )- ( a_3 = 2^{2} = 4 )- ( a_4 = 2^{3} = 8 )- And so on.Yes, that works. So, ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) for ( n geq 2 ), and ( a_1 = 2 ). So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can express it as ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) for all ( n geq 1 ), but then ( a_1 = 1 ), which is not the case. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, perhaps ( a_n = 2^{n-1} ) for ( n geq 2 ), and ( a_1 = 2 ). So, that's the way to go.Therefore, ( a_4 = 2^{4-1} = 8 ).So, in conclusion, after carefully working through the problem, verifying each step, checking for patterns, and ensuring that the recurrence relation holds correctly, I can confidently say that ( a_4 = 8 ).**Final Answer**The value of ( a_4 ) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"In parallelogram ABCD, angle B measures 110^circ.

Since angles ( B ) and ( C ) are consecutive angles in the parallelogram, their measures must add up to ( 180^circ ).Setting up the equation:[angle B + angle C = 180^circ]Substituting the known value of ( angle B ):[110^circ + angle C = 180^circ]Solving for ( angle C ):[angle C = 180^circ - 110^circ = 70^circ]Therefore, the measure of angle ( C ) is ( 70^circ )."},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (3, 4) and overrightarrow{b} = (sinalpha, cosalpha), and that overrightarrow{a} is parallel to overrightarrow{b}, find the value of tan(alpha + frac{pi}{4}).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: given vectors a = (3, 4) and b = (sinα, cosα), and it says that vector a is parallel to vector b. I need to find the value of tan(α + π/4). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, I remember that if two vectors are parallel, they must be scalar multiples of each other. That means there exists some scalar k such that a = k * b. So, in component form, that would mean 3 = k * sinα and 4 = k * cosα. Got that.So, I can write two equations:1. 3 = k sinα2. 4 = k cosαNow, I can solve for k in both equations. From the first equation, k = 3 / sinα, and from the second, k = 4 / cosα. Since both expressions equal k, I can set them equal to each other: 3 / sinα = 4 / cosα.Hmm, that gives me a proportion. Let me write that down: 3 / sinα = 4 / cosα. If I cross-multiply, I get 3 cosα = 4 sinα. That simplifies to 3 cosα - 4 sinα = 0. Hmm, maybe I can express this as a single trigonometric function.Alternatively, I can divide both sides by cosα to get 3 = 4 tanα. So, 3 = 4 tanα, which means tanα = 3/4. Okay, that's straightforward. So, tanα is 3/4.Now, the problem asks for tan(α + π/4). I remember there's a tangent addition formula: tan(A + B) = (tanA + tanB) / (1 - tanA tanB). Let me apply that here.So, A is α and B is π/4. Therefore, tan(α + π/4) = (tanα + tan(π/4)) / (1 - tanα tan(π/4)). I know that tan(π/4) is 1, so substituting that in, it becomes (tanα + 1) / (1 - tanα * 1).Since I found tanα = 3/4, plug that into the formula: (3/4 + 1) / (1 - 3/4). Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.Numerator: 3/4 + 1 = 3/4 + 4/4 = 7/4.Denominator: 1 - 3/4 = 1/4.So, tan(α + π/4) = (7/4) / (1/4) = (7/4) * (4/1) = 7.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.1. Vectors a and b are parallel, so a = k * b.2. So, 3 = k sinα and 4 = k cosα.3. Dividing these gives 3/4 = (k sinα)/(k cosα) = tanα. So, tanα = 3/4. That's correct.4. Then, using the tangent addition formula: tan(α + π/4) = (tanα + 1)/(1 - tanα).5. Substituting tanα = 3/4: (3/4 + 1)/(1 - 3/4) = (7/4)/(1/4) = 7. Yep, that seems right.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the angle α. Since tanα = 3/4, α is an angle whose tangent is 3/4. So, it's like a right triangle with opposite side 3 and adjacent side 4, hypotenuse 5. So, sinα = 3/5 and cosα = 4/5. Wait, but in the vector b, it's given as (sinα, cosα). So, is that a unit vector? Because sin²α + cos²α = 1, so yes, vector b is a unit vector.But vector a is (3,4), which has a magnitude of 5. So, if a is parallel to b, then a must be 5 times b, right? Because the magnitude of a is 5, and b is a unit vector. So, k should be 5. Let me check that.If k = 5, then 3 = 5 sinα and 4 = 5 cosα. So, sinα = 3/5 and cosα = 4/5. That's consistent with what I had earlier. So, tanα = sinα / cosα = (3/5)/(4/5) = 3/4. So, that's correct.Therefore, tan(α + π/4) is indeed 7. So, I think that's the answer.Wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using direction angles or something. The direction of vector a is given by tanθ = 4/3, where θ is the angle that vector a makes with the x-axis. Similarly, vector b is (sinα, cosα), which is equivalent to (cos(π/2 - α), sin(π/2 - α)), so it's a unit vector making an angle of π/2 - α with the x-axis. Since they are parallel, their angles must differ by an integer multiple of π.But since both vectors are in the same direction (assuming they are parallel in the same direction; if they were anti-parallel, the angle would differ by π, but the tangent would still be the same because tan(α + π) = tanα). So, θ = π/2 - α + kπ, for some integer k. But since tan is periodic with period π, the value of tan(α + π/4) would be the same regardless of k.So, θ = π/2 - α + kπ. Let's take k=0 for simplicity: θ = π/2 - α. So, α = π/2 - θ. Then, tanα = tan(π/2 - θ) = cotθ. But tanθ = 4/3, so cotθ = 3/4. So, tanα = 3/4, which is consistent with what I found earlier. So, that's another way to see it.Therefore, tan(α + π/4) = 7. I think that's solid.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute tan(α + π/4) numerically. If tanα = 3/4, then α is arctan(3/4). Let me compute arctan(3/4). Let's see, 3/4 is 0.75. Arctan(0.75) is approximately 36.87 degrees. So, α ≈ 36.87 degrees. Then, α + π/4 is 36.87 + 45 = 81.87 degrees. Tan(81.87 degrees) is approximately tan(81.87) ≈ 7. So, that matches. So, numerically, it's about 7, which is consistent with my earlier result.Therefore, I'm confident that tan(α + π/4) is 7.**Final Answer**The value of tan(alpha + frac{pi}{4}) is boxed{7}."},{"question":"Calculate: (1) sqrt{27}+sqrt{3}=______; (2) (sqrt{2}+1)(sqrt{2}-1)=______.","answer":"To solve the first expression, I need to simplify the square roots.

Applying this, I get (√2)² - (1)², which simplifies to 2 - 1, resulting in 1."},{"question":"In the arithmetic sequence ({a_n}), where (a_2=5) and (a_5=33), find the value of (a_3+a_4).","answer":"First, I recognize that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference, denoted as (d).Given that (a_2 = 5) and (a_5 = 33), I can set up two equations based on the general formula for the (n)-th term of an arithmetic sequence: (a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d).From (a_2 = 5), the equation becomes:[a_1 + d = 5]From (a_5 = 33), the equation becomes:[a_1 + 4d = 33]Next, I'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate (a_1) and solve for (d):[(a_1 + 4d) - (a_1 + d) = 33 - 5][3d = 28][d = frac{28}{3}]Now that I have the common difference (d), I can find (a_1) by substituting (d) back into the first equation:[a_1 + frac{28}{3} = 5][a_1 = 5 - frac{28}{3} = -frac{13}{3}]With (a_1) and (d) known, I can calculate (a_3) and (a_4):[a_3 = a_1 + 2d = -frac{13}{3} + 2 times frac{28}{3} = frac{43}{3}][a_4 = a_1 + 3d = -frac{13}{3} + 3 times frac{28}{3} = frac{71}{3}]Finally, I'll find the sum of (a_3) and (a_4):[a_3 + a_4 = frac{43}{3} + frac{71}{3} = frac{114}{3} = 38]"},{"question":"Determine the slope and the x- and y-axis intercepts of the line 3x - 2y + 24 = 0.","answer":"To determine the slope and intercepts of the line represented by the equation (3x - 2y + 24 = 0), I will first convert the equation into the slope-intercept form, which is (y = mx + b), where (m) is the slope and (b) is the y-intercept.Starting with the given equation:[3x - 2y + 24 = 0]I will isolate the (y) term by moving the other terms to the other side:[-2y = -3x - 24]Next, I will solve for (y) by dividing every term by (-2):[y = frac{3}{2}x + 12]From this equation, the slope (m) is (frac{3}{2}) and the y-intercept (b) is (12).To find the x-intercept, I will set (y = 0) and solve for (x):[0 = frac{3}{2}x + 12][frac{3}{2}x = -12][x = -8]Therefore, the x-intercept is (-8)."},{"question":"In how many ways can 5 pencils, 3 notebooks, and 2 rulers be distributed among three people if items of the same name are considered completely identical?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many ways I can distribute 5 pencils, 3 notebooks, and 2 rulers among three people. The catch is that items of the same name are identical, meaning all pencils are the same, all notebooks are the same, and all rulers are the same. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, I think I should handle each type of item separately because they are different categories. So, I can consider pencils, notebooks, and rulers one by one and then multiply the number of ways for each since the distributions are independent. That makes sense because the way I distribute pencils doesn't affect how I distribute notebooks or rulers.Starting with the pencils: I have 5 identical pencils and 3 people. I need to find the number of ways to distribute these pencils. I remember that when distributing identical items among distinct people, it's a classic stars and bars problem. The formula for that is C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the number of identical items and k is the number of people. So, in this case, n is 5 pencils and k is 3 people. Plugging into the formula, it should be C(5 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(7, 2). Calculating that, C(7,2) is 21. So, there are 21 ways to distribute the pencils.Moving on to the notebooks: I have 3 identical notebooks and 3 people. Using the same logic, the number of ways should be C(3 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(5, 2). Calculating that, C(5,2) is 10. So, 10 ways for the notebooks.Now, the rulers: I have 2 identical rulers and 3 people. Again, applying the stars and bars formula, it's C(2 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(4, 2). C(4,2) is 6. So, 6 ways for the rulers.Since the distributions of pencils, notebooks, and rulers are independent events, I should multiply the number of ways for each to get the total number of distributions. That would be 21 (pencils) * 10 (notebooks) * 6 (rulers). Let me compute that: 21 * 10 is 210, and 210 * 6 is 1260.Wait, hold on a second. Is that all? Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Each distribution is independent, so yes, multiplying them should give the total number of ways. But let me think about whether there's any restriction or something else I need to consider.The problem says items of the same name are identical, but it doesn't specify any restrictions on how many items a person can receive. So, a person can receive any number of pencils, notebooks, or rulers, including zero. That means my initial approach is correct because stars and bars allows for zero or more items per person.Just to double-check, let's think about a simpler case. Suppose I have 1 pencil, 1 notebook, and 1 ruler. Then, the number of ways should be 3 (for the pencil) * 3 (for the notebook) * 3 (for the ruler) = 27. Using my method, for 1 pencil, it's C(1 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(3,2) = 3. Similarly, for 1 notebook, it's 3, and for 1 ruler, it's 3. Multiplying them gives 27, which is correct. So, my method works for this simpler case.Another test case: distributing 2 pencils and 1 notebook. The number of ways should be C(2 + 3 -1, 3 -1) * C(1 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(4,2)*C(3,2) = 6*3=18. Alternatively, manually, for pencils, each person can get 0,1, or 2 pencils, but since they are identical, the number of distributions is 6. For notebooks, each person can get 0 or 1 notebook, which is 3 ways. So, 6*3=18, which matches. So, my method is consistent.Therefore, going back to the original problem, 21 * 10 * 6 = 1260 seems correct.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a different way to approach this problem? Maybe using generating functions? Let me try that to cross-verify.For pencils, the generating function would be (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5) for each person, but since we have 5 pencils, it's (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)^3. But actually, since the pencils are identical, the generating function is (1 + x + x^2 + ...)^3, which is 1/(1 - x)^3. But since we have exactly 5 pencils, the coefficient of x^5 in 1/(1 - x)^3 is C(5 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(7,2) = 21, which matches my earlier calculation.Similarly, for notebooks, the generating function is (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)^3, but since we have exactly 3 notebooks, the coefficient of x^3 in 1/(1 - x)^3 is C(3 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(5,2) = 10.For rulers, the generating function is (1 + x + x^2)^3, and the coefficient of x^2 is C(2 + 3 -1, 3 -1) = C(4,2) = 6.So, again, multiplying 21 * 10 * 6 gives 1260. So, the generating function approach also leads me to the same answer.Is there another perspective? Maybe considering each person and how many items they receive. But since the items are different categories, it's a bit more complicated. Wait, no, actually, each category is independent, so it's the same as before.Alternatively, think of it as three separate distributions: one for pencils, one for notebooks, one for rulers. Each distribution is independent, so the total number is the product of each distribution's possibilities.I think I've verified it multiple ways, so I'm pretty confident that 1260 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The number of ways to distribute the items is boxed{1260}."},{"question":"Two numbers have a difference of 3 and a sum of 31.

Calculate the locomotive's power if the coefficient of friction is 0.005. What is the maximum speed this train can achieve on a track with a gradient of 1:100 (the tangent of the slope angle is =0.01)?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a railway train. It says the train has a total weight of 300 tons and reaches a maximum speed of 35 km/h on a horizontal plane. I need to calculate the locomotive's power, given that the coefficient of friction is 0.005. Then, I also have to find the maximum speed this train can achieve on a track with a gradient of 1:100, where the tangent of the slope angle is 0.01.Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. First, the train is moving on a horizontal plane, so the only force opposing its motion is friction. The maximum speed is given, which probably means that the train is moving at a constant speed, so the power required is just to overcome the frictional force.Wait, power is force times velocity, right? So, if I can find the force opposing the motion, which is friction, and then multiply it by the velocity, I should get the power.But let me make sure. The formula for power is P = F * v, where F is the force and v is the velocity. Since the train is moving at a constant speed, the net force is zero, so the driving force from the locomotive must equal the frictional force. Therefore, the power required is indeed F_friction * velocity.Okay, so first, I need to calculate the frictional force. Frictional force is given by F_friction = μ * N, where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force.In this case, since the train is on a horizontal plane, the normal force N is equal to the weight of the train. The weight is given as 300 tons. Wait, tons can be a bit tricky because sometimes it's metric tons or short tons. But in railway contexts, I think it's metric tons. So, 1 metric ton is 1000 kg. Therefore, 300 tons is 300,000 kg.So, the weight in newtons is mass times gravity. Mass is 300,000 kg, and gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s². So, weight W = m * g = 300,000 kg * 9.81 m/s².Let me compute that: 300,000 * 9.81. Let's see, 300,000 * 10 is 3,000,000, so subtract 300,000 * 0.19, which is 57,000. So, 3,000,000 - 57,000 = 2,943,000 N. So, the weight is 2,943,000 newtons.Therefore, the normal force N is 2,943,000 N. Then, the frictional force F_friction = μ * N = 0.005 * 2,943,000 N.Calculating that: 0.005 * 2,943,000. Let's see, 0.005 is 5 thousandths, so 2,943,000 divided by 200. Let me compute 2,943,000 / 200. 2,943,000 divided by 200 is 14,715 N. So, the frictional force is 14,715 N.Now, the velocity is given as 35 km/h. But power is usually calculated in watts, which is joules per second, and velocity in meters per second. So, I need to convert 35 km/h to m/s.To convert km/h to m/s, I multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 h). So, 35 km/h = 35 * (1000 / 3600) m/s.Calculating that: 35 * (5/18) ≈ 35 * 0.27778 ≈ 9.7222 m/s. So, approximately 9.7222 m/s.Now, power P = F * v = 14,715 N * 9.7222 m/s.Let me compute that: 14,715 * 9.7222. Let's break it down.First, 14,715 * 9 = 132,435.Then, 14,715 * 0.7222. Let's compute 14,715 * 0.7 = 10,300.5, and 14,715 * 0.0222 ≈ 14,715 * 0.02 = 294.3, and 14,715 * 0.0022 ≈ 32.373. So, adding those: 294.3 + 32.373 ≈ 326.673.So, 10,300.5 + 326.673 ≈ 10,627.173.Therefore, total power is 132,435 + 10,627.173 ≈ 143,062.173 watts, which is approximately 143.062 kilowatts.Wait, but that seems a bit low for a train's power. Let me double-check my calculations.First, the mass: 300 tons is 300,000 kg, correct. Weight is 300,000 * 9.81 = 2,943,000 N, correct.Frictional force: 0.005 * 2,943,000 = 14,715 N, correct.Velocity: 35 km/h is 35 * 1000 / 3600 ≈ 9.7222 m/s, correct.Power: 14,715 * 9.7222 ≈ let me compute it more accurately.14,715 * 9 = 132,43514,715 * 0.7 = 10,300.514,715 * 0.0222 ≈ 14,715 * 0.02 = 294.3; 14,715 * 0.0022 ≈ 32.373So, 294.3 + 32.373 ≈ 326.673So, 10,300.5 + 326.673 ≈ 10,627.173Total: 132,435 + 10,627.173 ≈ 143,062.173 W, which is 143.062 kW.Hmm, 143 kW seems low for a train. I thought trains have much higher power. Maybe I made a mistake in units somewhere.Wait, 300 tons is 300,000 kg, correct. 300,000 kg * 9.81 m/s² is indeed 2,943,000 N. Friction is 0.005 * that, which is 14,715 N, correct.Velocity is 35 km/h, which is approximately 9.7222 m/s, correct.So, 14,715 N * 9.7222 m/s is indeed approximately 143,062 W, which is 143.062 kW. Hmm, maybe that's correct? Or perhaps the coefficient of friction is given as 0.005, which is quite low, so the power required is not too high.Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in horsepower? But the question says \\"power,\\" so probably in watts or kilowatts.Wait, 143 kW is about 190 horsepower, which still seems low for a train. Maybe I made a mistake in the velocity conversion.Wait, 35 km/h is 35,000 meters per hour. Divided by 3600 seconds, so 35,000 / 3600 ≈ 9.7222 m/s, correct.Alternatively, maybe the weight is 300 tons-force, which is 300,000 kg, but sometimes tons can be confused with ton-force or ton-mass. But in this context, I think it's mass.Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of friction is 0.005 per wheel, but no, the problem says coefficient of friction is 0.005, so that's the total.Wait, maybe the problem is in the unit of tons. If it's 300 tons, is that 300,000 kg or 300 * 1000 kg? Wait, 1 ton is 1000 kg, so 300 tons is 300,000 kg, correct.Wait, maybe the problem is in the calculation of friction. Maybe it's the coefficient of rolling resistance, which is often given as a percentage, but here it's given as 0.005, which is 0.5%, which is reasonable.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the power in horsepower? 143 kW is approximately 190 horsepower, which is still low for a train. Wait, but maybe it's just a small train or a locomotive with multiple units.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the frictional force. Wait, 0.005 * 2,943,000 is 14,715 N, correct.Wait, 14,715 N is about 14.7 kN. So, 14.7 kN * 9.7222 m/s is 143,062 W, correct.Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me check online for a rough estimate. A typical locomotive might have a power output of several megawatts, but maybe this is an older or smaller locomotive.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the weight. Wait, 300 tons is 300,000 kg, but sometimes in railway contexts, the weight is given in tonnes, which is the same as metric tons, so 300,000 kg is correct.Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is in the units of velocity. If the velocity is given in km/h, and I converted it to m/s correctly, but perhaps I should have kept it in km/h for some reason? But no, power is in watts, which is in SI units, so m/s is correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in horsepower. Let me convert 143,062 W to horsepower. 1 horsepower is approximately 745.7 W, so 143,062 / 745.7 ≈ 191.8 horsepower. Still, that seems low for a train.Wait, maybe the problem is that the train's total weight includes the locomotive, so the power is just for the locomotive, but the total weight is 300 tons. Hmm, but the problem says \\"the locomotive's power,\\" so it's the power of the locomotive, which is part of the 300 tons. So, maybe that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the frictional force. Let me check that again.Frictional force F = μ * N. μ is 0.005, N is weight, which is 300,000 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 2,943,000 N. So, 0.005 * 2,943,000 = 14,715 N. Correct.Velocity is 35 km/h = 9.7222 m/s. Correct.Power P = F * v = 14,715 * 9.7222 ≈ 143,062 W ≈ 143.06 kW.Hmm, maybe that's correct. Let me proceed to the second part of the problem.The second part asks: What is the maximum speed this train can achieve on a track with a gradient of 1:100 (the tangent of the slope angle is 0.01)?So, now the train is moving up a slope with a gradient of 1:100, which means that for every 100 units of horizontal distance, it rises 1 unit. The tangent of the angle is 0.01, which is the slope.So, in this case, the forces opposing the motion are both friction and the component of the weight along the slope.So, the total opposing force F_total = F_friction + F_gravity_component.F_friction is still μ * N, but now N is not equal to the weight, because on an incline, the normal force is reduced.Wait, actually, on an incline, the normal force N is equal to the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope. So, N = m * g * cos(theta), where theta is the angle of the slope.But since tan(theta) = 0.01, we can find sin(theta) and cos(theta). Because tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = 0.01, so we can imagine a right triangle with opposite side 0.01 and adjacent side 1, so hypotenuse is sqrt(1 + (0.01)^2) ≈ 1.00005, which is approximately 1 for small angles.Therefore, sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) = 0.01, and cos(theta) ≈ 1.So, N ≈ m * g * 1 = m * g, which is the same as before. Wait, but that can't be right because on an incline, the normal force is less than the weight. Wait, no, actually, when the angle is small, cos(theta) is approximately 1, so N ≈ m * g.But let me check: tan(theta) = 0.01, so theta ≈ arctan(0.01) ≈ 0.57 degrees. So, a very small angle. Therefore, sin(theta) ≈ 0.01, and cos(theta) ≈ 0.99995, which is approximately 1.Therefore, N ≈ m * g * cos(theta) ≈ m * g * 1 = 2,943,000 N.So, F_friction = μ * N = 0.005 * 2,943,000 ≈ 14,715 N, same as before.Wait, but actually, on an incline, the normal force is less, so frictional force should be less. But since the angle is so small, the difference is negligible. So, perhaps we can approximate F_friction as 14,715 N.But let me compute it more accurately. Since cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta)) = 1 / sqrt(1 + 0.0001) ≈ 1 - 0.00005, so approximately 0.99995.Therefore, N = m * g * cos(theta) ≈ 2,943,000 * 0.99995 ≈ 2,942,950 N.So, F_friction = 0.005 * 2,942,950 ≈ 14,714.75 N, which is almost the same as before.Therefore, the frictional force is approximately the same as on the horizontal plane.Now, the other force opposing the motion is the component of the weight along the slope, which is F_gravity = m * g * sin(theta).Since sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) = 0.01, so F_gravity = 2,943,000 N * 0.01 = 29,430 N.Therefore, the total opposing force F_total = F_friction + F_gravity ≈ 14,715 N + 29,430 N = 44,145 N.Now, the power required to overcome this force at a certain speed is P = F_total * v.But wait, in the first part, the power was calculated as 143,062 W when moving at 35 km/h. Now, on the incline, the total opposing force is higher, so if the locomotive's power remains the same, the maximum speed will be lower.Wait, but the problem says \\"the maximum speed this train can achieve on a track with a gradient of 1:100.\\" So, assuming the locomotive's power is the same as calculated before, 143,062 W, we can find the maximum speed by dividing the power by the total opposing force.So, v = P / F_total.So, v = 143,062 W / 44,145 N ≈ ?Let me compute that: 143,062 / 44,145 ≈ 3.24 m/s.Convert that back to km/h: 3.24 m/s * (3600 s / 1000 m) = 3.24 * 3.6 ≈ 11.664 km/h.So, approximately 11.66 km/h.Wait, that seems quite a drop in speed. From 35 km/h on flat to about 11.66 km/h on a 1% gradient. Hmm, that seems significant, but considering the additional force due to the gradient, it might be correct.Let me double-check the calculations.First, total opposing force on the incline: F_friction + F_gravity.F_friction ≈ 14,715 N, F_gravity = 29,430 N, so total ≈ 44,145 N.Power is 143,062 W.So, v = 143,062 / 44,145 ≈ 3.24 m/s.Convert to km/h: 3.24 * 3.6 ≈ 11.664 km/h.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the power is the same, so P = F_total * v, so v = P / F_total.Yes, that's what I did.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the power is the same as before, but the total force is higher, so the speed is lower.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the power required to overcome both friction and the gradient is the same as before, but that doesn't make sense because the total force is higher, so speed must be lower.Wait, but in the first part, the power was calculated as 143,062 W when moving at 35 km/h on flat. So, on the incline, the same power would result in a lower speed because the total force is higher.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the power to remain the same, so the speed decreases. So, the maximum speed on the incline is 11.66 km/h.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the power is the same, but let me think again.Wait, the power is the same because it's the same locomotive. So, the power is fixed, so when the opposing force increases, the speed must decrease to maintain the same power.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the power is the same, so P = F_total * v, so v = P / F_total.Yes, that's what I did.So, the maximum speed on the incline is approximately 11.66 km/h.Wait, but let me check the calculations again.F_total = 44,145 N.Power P = 143,062 W.v = 143,062 / 44,145 ≈ 3.24 m/s.Convert to km/h: 3.24 * 3.6 = 11.664 km/h.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the gradient adds to the frictional force, so the total force is higher, hence lower speed.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the gradient is 1:100, which is a 1% grade, which is a gentle slope, but still, it adds a significant force.Yes, 29,430 N is almost double the frictional force, so the total force is about 44,145 N, which is about 3 times the frictional force on flat. Therefore, the speed would be about a third, which is roughly 11.66 km/h.Yes, that seems reasonable.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the power is the same, so the speed is inversely proportional to the total force. So, since the total force is 44,145 N, which is 3 times the frictional force on flat (14,715 N), the speed would be 35 km/h divided by 3, which is approximately 11.666 km/h. So, that's consistent.Therefore, the maximum speed on the incline is approximately 11.66 km/h.So, to summarize:1. Calculate the frictional force on flat: F_friction = μ * m * g = 0.005 * 300,000 kg * 9.81 m/s² ≈ 14,715 N.2. Convert speed to m/s: 35 km/h ≈ 9.7222 m/s.3. Calculate power: P = F_friction * v ≈ 14,715 N * 9.7222 m/s ≈ 143,062 W ≈ 143.06 kW.4. On incline, total opposing force: F_total = F_friction + F_gravity ≈ 14,715 N + 29,430 N ≈ 44,145 N.5. Calculate maximum speed on incline: v = P / F_total ≈ 143,062 W / 44,145 N ≈ 3.24 m/s ≈ 11.66 km/h.Therefore, the locomotive's power is approximately 143.06 kW, and the maximum speed on a 1:100 gradient is approximately 11.66 km/h.Wait, but the problem asks for the maximum speed on the gradient, so I think that's the answer.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the power is the same, so the speed is lower. Yes, that's what I did.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in a different unit or more precise decimal places, but I think two decimal places are sufficient.So, final answers:Power: 143.06 kWMaximum speed on gradient: 11.66 km/hBut let me check if I can express these more neatly.Power: 143.06 kW is approximately 143.1 kW.Maximum speed: 11.66 km/h is approximately 11.7 km/h.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answers in whole numbers.So, 143 kW and 12 km/h.But let me see if my calculations are precise enough.Wait, 143,062 W is 143.062 kW, so 143.06 kW is precise.Similarly, 11.664 km/h is approximately 11.66 km/h.Alternatively, maybe I should have carried more decimal places in intermediate steps to get a more accurate result.But for the purposes of this problem, I think two decimal places are sufficient.So, to conclude:The locomotive's power is approximately 143.06 kW, and the maximum speed on a 1:100 gradient is approximately 11.66 km/h.But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation of F_gravity.F_gravity = m * g * sin(theta). Since sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) = 0.01, so F_gravity = 300,000 kg * 9.81 m/s² * 0.01.Wait, 300,000 * 9.81 = 2,943,000 N, so 2,943,000 * 0.01 = 29,430 N. Correct.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I should have considered that the gradient is 1:100, which is a rise of 1 unit over 100 units, so the sine of the angle is 1/100 = 0.01, which is correct.Therefore, F_gravity = m * g * sin(theta) = 300,000 * 9.81 * 0.01 = 29,430 N.Yes, correct.Therefore, the calculations are correct.So, the final answers are:Power: 143.06 kWMaximum speed on gradient: 11.66 km/hBut let me check if the problem expects the answers in different units or if I should present them differently.The problem says \\"Calculate the locomotive's power\\" and \\"What is the maximum speed...\\".So, probably, the answers should be in the same units as given, which are tons, km/h, and the coefficient of friction is dimensionless.So, power in watts or kilowatts, and speed in km/h.Therefore, I think 143.06 kW and 11.66 km/h are appropriate.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answers in horsepower and mph, but the problem is given in metric units, so probably not.Therefore, I think my answers are correct."},{"question":"Every cell of a  3times 3  board is coloured either by red or blue. Find the number of all colorings in which there are no  2times 2  squares in which all cells are red.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of colorings of a 3x3 board where each cell is either red or blue. The condition is that there should be no 2x2 square where all four cells are red. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand the problem. I have a 3x3 grid, so that's 9 cells in total. Each cell can be colored either red or blue. Without any restrictions, the total number of colorings would be 2^9, which is 512. But we have a restriction: no 2x2 all-red squares. So, I need to subtract the number of colorings that have at least one 2x2 all-red square from the total.Wait, but inclusion-exclusion might come into play here because there could be overlapping 2x2 squares. Let me think about how many 2x2 squares are there in a 3x3 grid. In each dimension, a 2x2 square can start at position 1 or 2, so in both rows and columns, that's 2 choices each. So, the number of 2x2 squares is 2x2=4. Let me visualize the 3x3 grid:Let's label the cells from (1,1) to (3,3). The four 2x2 squares would be:1. Top-left: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)2. Top-right: cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)3. Bottom-left: cells (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)4. Bottom-right: cells (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)So, four 2x2 squares in total. Now, each of these can potentially be all red. So, for each of these four squares, the number of colorings where that particular 2x2 square is all red is 2^(9-4)=2^5=32. Because if those four cells are fixed as red, the remaining five cells can be colored either red or blue.But wait, if I just subtract 4*32 from 512, I might be overcounting because some colorings might have more than one 2x2 all-red squares. So, I need to apply inclusion-exclusion here.Inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|So, first, let's compute |A|, |B|, |C|, |D|. Each is 32, as we saw earlier. So, the first term is 4*32=128.Now, the second term is the sum of all pairwise intersections. So, how many pairs are there? There are C(4,2)=6 pairs. Each pair corresponds to two 2x2 squares. Now, depending on how these two squares overlap, the number of cells fixed as red will vary.So, let's figure out for each pair, how many cells are fixed as red. If two 2x2 squares overlap, the overlapping region will have some cells that are fixed as red in both. So, the total number of fixed red cells is 4 + 4 - overlap.So, let's look at the four 2x2 squares:1. A: top-left2. B: top-right3. C: bottom-left4. D: bottom-rightNow, let's consider all pairs:- A and B: These are the top-left and top-right squares. They overlap in the top-middle 2x1 area, which is two cells: (1,2) and (2,2). So, the overlapping cells are two. Therefore, the total fixed red cells are 4 + 4 - 2 = 6. So, the number of colorings where both A and B are all red is 2^(9-6)=2^3=8.- A and C: These are the top-left and bottom-left squares. They overlap in the left-middle 1x2 area, which is two cells: (2,1) and (2,2). So, similar to above, fixed red cells are 4 + 4 - 2 = 6. So, colorings: 8.- A and D: Top-left and bottom-right. These two squares overlap only at cell (2,2). So, overlapping cells: 1. Therefore, fixed red cells: 4 + 4 - 1 = 7. So, colorings: 2^(9-7)=2^2=4.- B and C: Top-right and bottom-left. These two squares overlap only at cell (2,2). So, overlapping cells: 1. Fixed red cells: 7. Colorings: 4.- B and D: Top-right and bottom-right. They overlap in the right-middle 2x1 area, two cells: (2,2) and (2,3). Fixed red cells: 6. Colorings: 8.- C and D: Bottom-left and bottom-right. They overlap in the bottom-middle 2x1 area, two cells: (3,2) and (2,2). Fixed red cells: 6. Colorings: 8.So, for the pairwise intersections, we have:- Pairs A&B, A&C, B&D, C&D: each contribute 8 colorings. That's four pairs.- Pairs A&D, B&C: each contribute 4 colorings. That's two pairs.So, total for the second term is 4*8 + 2*4 = 32 + 8 = 40.So, subtracting this from the first term: 128 - 40 = 88.But wait, inclusion-exclusion isn't done yet. We have to add back the triple intersections.Third term: sum of |A ∩ B ∩ C|, |A ∩ B ∩ D|, |A ∩ C ∩ D|, |B ∩ C ∩ D|.So, four triplets.Let me compute each:1. A ∩ B ∩ C: Top-left, top-right, bottom-left. Let's see how many cells are fixed as red.A is top-left: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)B is top-right: cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)C is bottom-left: cells (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)So, combining these, the union of these three squares covers:From A: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)From B: (1,3), (2,3)From C: (3,1), (3,2)So, total fixed red cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2). That's 8 cells. So, only cell (3,3) is free. So, colorings: 2^(9-8)=2^1=2.2. A ∩ B ∩ D: Top-left, top-right, bottom-right.A: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)B: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)D: (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)Union of these:From A: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)From B: (1,3), (2,3)From D: (3,2), (3,3)So, fixed red cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). Again, 8 cells. Only cell (3,1) is free. So, colorings: 2.3. A ∩ C ∩ D: Top-left, bottom-left, bottom-right.A: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)C: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)D: (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)Union:From A: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)From C: (3,1), (3,2)From D: (2,3), (3,3)So, fixed red cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Again, 8 cells. Only cell (1,3) is free. Colorings: 2.4. B ∩ C ∩ D: Top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.B: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)C: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)D: (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)Union:From B: (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)From C: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)From D: (3,3)So, fixed red cells: (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Again, 8 cells. Only cell (1,1) is free. Colorings: 2.So, each triplet intersection contributes 2 colorings, and there are four triplets. So, total for the third term is 4*2=8.Adding this back: 88 + 8 = 96.Now, moving on to the fourth term: |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|. That is, all four 2x2 squares being all red. Let's see how many cells are fixed as red.A: top-leftB: top-rightC: bottom-leftD: bottom-rightSo, combining all four, the union would cover the entire 3x3 grid except for the center cell (2,2). Wait, no. Wait, actually, each 2x2 square includes the center cell (2,2). So, if all four 2x2 squares are all red, then every cell in the 3x3 grid must be red, because every cell is part of at least one 2x2 square. Let me check:- (1,1): only in A- (1,2): in A and B- (1,3): only in B- (2,1): in A and C- (2,2): in all four- (2,3): in B and D- (3,1): only in C- (3,2): in C and D- (3,3): only in DSo, if all four 2x2 squares are all red, then all cells must be red. So, the only coloring where all four 2x2 squares are all red is the all-red coloring. So, |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|=1.Therefore, the fourth term is 1. So, subtracting this: 96 - 1 = 95.So, putting it all together, the number of colorings with at least one all-red 2x2 square is 95. Therefore, the number of colorings with no all-red 2x2 squares is total colorings minus this, which is 512 - 95 = 417.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 512 - 95 is 417, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in inclusion-exclusion.So, step by step:Total colorings: 512Number of colorings with at least one all-red 2x2 square:First term: 4*32=128Second term: subtract 6 pairwise intersections, which we calculated as 40, so 128 - 40=88Third term: add back 4 triple intersections, each contributing 2, so 88 + 8=96Fourth term: subtract 1 for the quadruple intersection: 96 -1=95So, yes, 95 colorings have at least one all-red 2x2 square.Therefore, total valid colorings: 512 - 95=417.Hmm, but wait, I have a doubt here. Let me think again. When we calculated the pairwise intersections, for A&D and B&C, we had overlapping at one cell, leading to 7 fixed cells, so 2^2=4 colorings each. But is that correct?Wait, if two 2x2 squares overlap at one cell, then the total fixed cells are 4 + 4 -1=7, so the remaining cells are 2, so 2^2=4. That seems correct.Similarly, when two squares overlap at two cells, fixed cells are 6, so remaining cells are 3, so 2^3=8. That also seems correct.For triple intersections, each triplet fixed 8 cells, leaving 1 cell free, so 2 colorings each. That seems correct.And the quadruple intersection fixed all 9 cells, so only 1 coloring.So, yes, inclusion-exclusion seems correctly applied.Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by considering the grid and ensuring that no 2x2 square is all red. Maybe using complementary counting is the right approach, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the inclusion-exclusion.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem, where each 2x2 square must not be all red, and count the number of colorings accordingly.But inclusion-exclusion seems the standard approach here, so I think my calculation is correct.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the number of colorings with at least one all-red 2x2 square again.First, four 2x2 squares, each contributing 32 colorings: 4*32=128.But when two squares overlap, we've subtracted their intersections. So, 6 pairwise intersections, each contributing either 8 or 4 colorings, totaling 40. So, 128 - 40=88.Then, adding back the triple intersections: four triplets, each contributing 2 colorings, so 8. 88 + 8=96.Subtracting the quadruple intersection: 1. So, 96 -1=95.So, 95 colorings have at least one all-red 2x2 square. Therefore, total valid colorings: 512 -95=417.Wait, but I just thought of something. The inclusion-exclusion counts colorings where at least one 2x2 square is all red. But is that the only restriction? Yes, the problem says no 2x2 square can be all red. So, our calculation is correct.But let me think: is 417 a reasonable number? Let me see.Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using complementary counting with another method, such as recursive counting or something else.Alternatively, perhaps I can model the grid and count the number of colorings where no 2x2 square is all red.But that might be more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion but in a different way.Wait, another thought: maybe I can model the grid as a graph where each cell is a vertex, and edges connect cells that are in the same 2x2 square. Then, the problem reduces to counting the number of independent sets of size 4 in this graph, but that seems more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion as I did before, but maybe my counts for the intersections were wrong.Wait, let me recount the pairwise intersections.So, for each pair of 2x2 squares, how many cells are fixed as red?For A and B: overlapping cells are (1,2) and (2,2). So, fixed cells: 4 + 4 - 2=6. So, 2^(9-6)=8.Similarly, A and C: overlapping cells (2,1) and (2,2). Fixed cells: 6. So, 8 colorings.A and D: overlapping cell (2,2). Fixed cells: 7. So, 4 colorings.B and C: overlapping cell (2,2). Fixed cells:7. So, 4 colorings.B and D: overlapping cells (2,2) and (2,3). Fixed cells:6. So, 8 colorings.C and D: overlapping cells (2,2) and (3,2). Fixed cells:6. So, 8 colorings.So, that's correct. So, four pairs contribute 8, two pairs contribute 4. So, 4*8=32, 2*4=8, total 40.So, that's correct.Similarly, triple intersections: each triplet fixes 8 cells, so 2 colorings each.Quadruple intersection: fixes all 9 cells, so 1 coloring.So, inclusion-exclusion gives 128 -40 +8 -1=95.So, 512 -95=417.Hmm, okay, so I think that's correct.Wait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe using recursion or dynamic programming.But for a 3x3 grid, it's manageable, but perhaps not necessary.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total number of colorings without any all-red 2x2 squares by considering each row and column and ensuring that no 2x2 square is all red.But that might be more involved.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the grid as having four 2x2 squares, and for each, ensure that at least one cell is blue.But that might not be straightforward.Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem where each 2x2 square must have at least one blue cell, and count the number of solutions.But that's essentially what inclusion-exclusion is doing.So, I think my initial calculation is correct.Therefore, the number of valid colorings is 417.**Final Answer**The number of valid colorings is boxed{417}."},{"question":"Given a point (x, y) lies on the parabola y^2 = 4x, find the minimum value of the function z= frac{1}{2}y^2 + x^2 + 3.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a point (x, y) lies on the parabola y² = 4x, and I need to find the minimum value of the function z = (1/2)y² + x² + 3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, since the point is on the parabola y² = 4x, that means I can express x in terms of y or vice versa. Maybe substituting one into the other will help simplify the function z.Let me try substituting x from the parabola equation into z. From y² = 4x, I can solve for x: x = y² / 4. Okay, so I can plug that into z.So, z = (1/2)y² + (y² / 4)² + 3. Let me write that out:z = (1/2)y² + (y⁴ / 16) + 3.Hmm, that seems manageable. Now, z is a function of y, so maybe I can take the derivative with respect to y, set it equal to zero, and find the critical points. Then check if it's a minimum.Let me compute the derivative dz/dy.First, let's write z as:z = (1/2)y² + (1/16)y⁴ + 3.So, dz/dy = (1/2)*2y + (1/16)*4y³ + 0.Simplifying:dz/dy = y + (1/4)y³.Okay, so to find critical points, set dz/dy = 0:y + (1/4)y³ = 0.Factor out y:y(1 + (1/4)y²) = 0.So, either y = 0 or 1 + (1/4)y² = 0.But 1 + (1/4)y² = 0 implies y² = -4, which isn't possible since y² is always non-negative. So the only critical point is at y = 0.Wait, is that the only critical point? Let me double-check.We have dz/dy = y + (1/4)y³.Set to zero: y + (1/4)y³ = 0.Factor: y(1 + (1/4)y²) = 0.Yes, so solutions are y = 0 or 1 + (1/4)y² = 0. The latter has no real solutions, so only y = 0 is the critical point.Hmm, so does that mean the minimum occurs at y = 0? Let me check the second derivative to confirm if it's a minimum.Compute d²z/dy²:From dz/dy = y + (1/4)y³,d²z/dy² = 1 + (3/4)y².At y = 0, d²z/dy² = 1 + 0 = 1, which is positive. So, the function is concave upward at y = 0, meaning it's a local minimum.But wait, is this the global minimum? Since the function z is defined for all real y, but as y approaches infinity, z also approaches infinity because of the y⁴ term. Similarly, as y approaches negative infinity, z also approaches infinity. So, the function has a single critical point at y = 0, which is a local minimum, and since it's the only critical point, it must be the global minimum.Therefore, the minimum value of z occurs at y = 0.Now, let's find the corresponding x. From the parabola equation y² = 4x, if y = 0, then x = 0.So, the point is (0, 0). Let's compute z at this point:z = (1/2)(0)² + (0)² + 3 = 0 + 0 + 3 = 3.Wait, so z = 3 at (0, 0). Is that the minimum value?But hold on, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake because sometimes substituting can lead to missing other critical points.Wait, another way to approach this problem is to parametrize the parabola. Since it's a parabola y² = 4x, we can use parametric equations. For a parabola y² = 4ax, the parametric equations are x = at², y = 2at. In our case, a = 1, so x = t², y = 2t.So, substituting into z:z = (1/2)y² + x² + 3 = (1/2)(4t²) + (t²)² + 3 = 2t² + t⁴ + 3.So, z = t⁴ + 2t² + 3.Now, to find the minimum of z with respect to t, take derivative dz/dt:dz/dt = 4t³ + 4t.Set derivative equal to zero:4t³ + 4t = 0.Factor out 4t:4t(t² + 1) = 0.Solutions: t = 0 or t² + 1 = 0.Again, t² + 1 = 0 has no real solutions, so only t = 0 is critical point.Compute second derivative:d²z/dt² = 12t² + 4.At t = 0, d²z/dt² = 4, which is positive, so it's a local minimum.Thus, the minimum occurs at t = 0, which corresponds to x = 0² = 0, y = 2*0 = 0.So, z = 0 + 0 + 3 = 3.Wait, same result as before. So, seems consistent.But hold on, maybe I should check another point to see if z can be smaller. For example, let's take t = 1, then x = 1, y = 2.Compute z: (1/2)(4) + 1 + 3 = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.Which is bigger than 3.Take t = sqrt(1), same as above.Take t = sqrt(2), x = 2, y = 2*sqrt(2).Compute z: (1/2)(8) + 4 + 3 = 4 + 4 + 3 = 11.Even bigger.What about t = 1/2, x = 1/4, y = 1.Compute z: (1/2)(1) + (1/4)^2 + 3 = 0.5 + 0.0625 + 3 = 3.5625.Still bigger than 3.Wait, so seems like 3 is indeed the minimum.But let me think again. Maybe I should consider another substitution.Alternatively, since y² = 4x, so x = y² / 4. Then, substitute into z:z = (1/2)y² + (y² / 4)^2 + 3.Which is z = (1/2)y² + y⁴ / 16 + 3.Let me write this as z = y⁴ / 16 + (1/2)y² + 3.Let me set u = y², so u >= 0.Then, z = u² / 16 + (1/2)u + 3.So, now, z is a function of u: z(u) = (1/16)u² + (1/2)u + 3.Now, this is a quadratic in u, which opens upwards because the coefficient of u² is positive.Therefore, the minimum occurs at the vertex of the parabola.The vertex occurs at u = -b/(2a), where a = 1/16, b = 1/2.So, u = -(1/2) / (2*(1/16)) = -(1/2) / (1/8) = -(1/2)*(8/1) = -4.But u = y² >= 0, so u = -4 is not in the domain. Therefore, the minimum occurs at the smallest possible u, which is u = 0.Thus, z(0) = 0 + 0 + 3 = 3.Therefore, the minimum value of z is 3, achieved when u = 0, which corresponds to y = 0, and hence x = 0.So, all methods point to the minimum value being 3 at the origin.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers, since it's a constrained optimization problem.We need to minimize z = (1/2)y² + x² + 3, subject to the constraint y² = 4x.Set up the Lagrangian: L = (1/2)y² + x² + 3 + λ(y² - 4x).Take partial derivatives:∂L/∂x = 2x - 4λ = 0.∂L/∂y = y + 2λ y = 0.∂L/∂λ = y² - 4x = 0.From ∂L/∂y: y(1 + 2λ) = 0.So, either y = 0 or 1 + 2λ = 0.Case 1: y = 0.Then, from the constraint y² = 4x, we get x = 0.From ∂L/∂x: 2x - 4λ = 0 => 0 - 4λ = 0 => λ = 0.So, this is a critical point at (0, 0).Case 2: 1 + 2λ = 0 => λ = -1/2.From ∂L/∂x: 2x - 4λ = 0 => 2x - 4*(-1/2) = 0 => 2x + 2 = 0 => 2x = -2 => x = -1.But from the constraint y² = 4x, if x = -1, then y² = -4, which is not possible since y² cannot be negative.Therefore, Case 2 doesn't yield a feasible solution.Thus, the only critical point is at (0, 0), which gives z = 3.Therefore, the minimum value is indeed 3.Hmm, seems like all methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I think I can confidently say that the minimum value of z is 3.**Final Answer**The minimum value of the function is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Given eight distinguishable rings, let n be the number of possible five-ring arrangements on the four fingers (not the thumb) of one hand.

The order of the rings on each finger matters, and it's okay if some fingers don't have any rings. Then, I need to find the leftmost three nonzero digits of this number, which is denoted as ( n ).Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the rings are distinguishable, so each ring is unique. That means the order in which they are placed on a finger matters, and each arrangement is unique based on both the selection of rings and their order on each finger.Since we're dealing with four fingers and five rings, each finger can have zero or more rings, but the total number of rings across all fingers must be exactly five. Also, the order of the rings on each finger is significant, so for each finger, the arrangement of rings is a permutation.I think this is a problem that can be approached using permutations and combinations, but I need to figure out the exact method.Let me consider each ring individually. Each ring can be placed on any of the four fingers. However, since the order on each finger matters, it's not just a simple assignment of rings to fingers. Instead, for each finger, the rings on it form a sequence, so the order matters.Wait, so maybe this is similar to arranging the rings in a sequence and then partitioning them into four ordered lists (one for each finger). That sounds like a problem that can be modeled using exponential generating functions or something similar, but I might be overcomplicating.Alternatively, I remember that when arranging objects where the order matters and we have multiple groups, we can use the concept of arranging the objects with dividers. But in this case, the dividers would represent the separation between fingers. However, since the order on each finger matters, it's more like a permutation with labeled boxes where each box can have any number of objects, including zero.Wait, another thought: if each finger can have any number of rings, including zero, and the order on each finger matters, then for each ring, we can assign it to a finger and also determine its position relative to the other rings on that finger.But since the rings are distinguishable, the number of ways to arrange them on the fingers is equivalent to the number of functions from the set of rings to the set of fingers, multiplied by the number of orderings on each finger.But I think that's not quite right because the order on each finger is a permutation, so it's not just assigning each ring to a finger, but also determining the order in which they are placed on that finger.Wait, perhaps we can model this as a permutation problem where we first arrange all five rings in some order and then partition them into four sequences, each corresponding to a finger. The number of ways to do this would be the number of ways to arrange the five rings multiplied by the number of ways to partition them into four ordered lists.But how do we count the number of ways to partition a sequence into four ordered lists? That sounds like the concept of \\"stars and bars,\\" but with order considered.Wait, actually, for each arrangement of the five rings, we can insert three dividers among the four gaps between the rings to separate them into four fingers. The number of ways to insert these dividers is ( binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = binom{8}{3} ). But wait, that's for indistinct items. Since the rings are distinguishable, each arrangement is unique.Wait, no, actually, the number of ways to partition a sequence of distinguishable objects into ordered lists is given by the number of compositions. For each composition of 5 into 4 parts, we can have different arrangements. But perhaps another approach is better.Alternatively, think of it as for each ring, we can choose which finger it goes on, and then for each finger, we can arrange the rings in order. So, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible distributions of the rings to the fingers, multiplied by the number of orderings for each distribution.But that seems complicated because we have to consider all possible distributions. Maybe there's a generating function approach.Alternatively, I remember that when arranging distinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes where the order in each box matters, the total number is ( k! times S(n, k) ), where ( S(n, k) ) is the Stirling numbers of the second kind. But wait, no, that's for indistinct boxes or something else.Wait, no, actually, if the order matters in each box, then for each object, we can assign it to a box and also determine its position. So, for each object, the number of choices is the number of boxes multiplied by the number of positions it can take in that box relative to the other objects.But since the positions are relative, it's a bit tricky. Maybe another way: for each finger, the number of ways to arrange ( k ) rings on it is ( k! ). So, if we have a distribution of the five rings among the four fingers, say ( k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 ) where ( k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 5 ), then the number of arrangements for that distribution is ( frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!} times (k_1!)(k_2!)(k_3!)(k_4!) ). Wait, that simplifies to ( 5! times ) the number of distributions.Wait, that can't be right because ( frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!} ) is the multinomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to assign the rings to the fingers given the distribution ( k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 ), and then ( (k_1!)(k_2!)(k_3!)(k_4!) ) is the number of ways to arrange the rings on each finger. So, multiplying them together gives the total number of arrangements for that distribution.But then, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible distributions of ( frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!} times (k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!) ). But that simplifies to ( 5! times ) the number of distributions.Wait, but the number of distributions is the number of ways to assign five distinguishable rings to four distinguishable fingers, which is ( 4^5 ). So, does that mean the total number of arrangements is ( 5! times 4^5 )?Wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. If each ring can go on any finger, and for each finger, the rings can be arranged in any order, then for each finger, the number of possible arrangements is the number of permutations of the subset of rings assigned to it.So, for each ring, we choose which finger it goes on, and then for each finger, we arrange its rings in some order. So, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible assignments of the product of the permutations on each finger.But that's equivalent to ( sum_{k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 5} frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!} times (k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!) ) which is ( 5! times sum_{k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 5} 1 ). But the number of terms in the sum is the number of distributions, which is ( binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = binom{8}{3} = 56 ). So, the total number of arrangements would be ( 5! times 56 = 120 times 56 = 6720 ).Wait, but that can't be right because 5! is 120, and 4^5 is 1024, so 120*1024 is 122880, which is way larger. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.Wait, no, actually, the problem is that I'm confusing two different things: assigning rings to fingers and then arranging them. Let me try a different approach.Each arrangement can be thought of as a function from the set of five rings to the set of four fingers, where the order on each finger matters. So, for each ring, we assign it to a finger, and then for each finger, we arrange its assigned rings in some order.But the key is that the order on each finger is significant, so it's not just a matter of assigning each ring to a finger, but also determining the order in which they are placed on that finger.Wait, so perhaps the total number of arrangements is equal to the number of total orderings of the five rings multiplied by the number of ways to assign each position in the ordering to a finger.Wait, that might be a way to think about it. So, if we first arrange all five rings in some order, which can be done in 5! ways, and then assign each position in this sequence to one of the four fingers. The assignment can be done in 4^5 ways because each of the five positions can go to any of the four fingers.But then, the total number of arrangements would be 5! × 4^5 = 120 × 1024 = 122880.But wait, that seems too high because 4^5 is 1024, which is the number of ways to assign each ring to a finger, and 5! is the number of orderings. But actually, when you assign each ring to a finger and then order them on each finger, it's equivalent to first ordering all the rings and then partitioning them into four sequences, each assigned to a finger.But in that case, the number of ways would be 5! × S(5,4), where S(5,4) is the Stirling numbers of the second kind, but that's for indistinct boxes. Wait, no, actually, if the boxes are distinct, then it's 5! × 4! / (4 - 5)! which doesn't make sense because 4 - 5 is negative.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.Each finger can have any number of rings, including zero, and the order on each finger matters. So, for each finger, the number of possible arrangements is the number of permutations of the subset of rings assigned to it. So, if we have a distribution of the rings among the fingers, say finger 1 has k1 rings, finger 2 has k2, etc., then the number of arrangements is the multinomial coefficient multiplied by the product of the factorials for each finger.Wait, so the total number is the sum over all possible distributions of (5! / (k1! k2! k3! k4!)) × (k1! k2! k3! k4!) which simplifies to 5! × number of distributions.But the number of distributions is the number of ways to assign 5 distinguishable rings to 4 distinguishable fingers, which is 4^5. So, the total number is 5! × 4^5 = 120 × 1024 = 122880.Wait, but that seems high because when I think about it, each ring can be placed on any finger, and for each finger, the rings can be arranged in any order. So, for each finger, the number of possible arrangements is the number of permutations of the rings assigned to it. So, if a finger has k rings, there are k! ways to arrange them.But since the rings are assigned to fingers, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible assignments of the product of the permutations on each finger.But that's equivalent to 4^5 × 5! because for each assignment, you have 5! ways to order all the rings, but that's not quite right because the order is per finger, not globally.Wait, maybe another approach: for each ring, we can assign it to a finger and also assign it a position on that finger relative to the other rings. So, for each ring, the number of choices is 4 (fingers) multiplied by the number of possible positions on that finger.But the number of positions depends on how many rings are already on that finger. This seems recursive.Alternatively, think of it as a generating function problem. The exponential generating function for each finger is ( 1 + x + frac{x^2}{2!} + frac{x^3}{3!} + dots ) which is ( e^x ). Since there are four fingers, the generating function is ( (e^x)^4 = e^{4x} ). The coefficient of ( x^5 ) in this generating function multiplied by 5! gives the number of arrangements. The coefficient of ( x^5 ) in ( e^{4x} ) is ( frac{4^5}{5!} ), so multiplying by 5! gives ( 4^5 = 1024 ). But that can't be right because that would mean the number of arrangements is 1024, but considering the order on each finger, it should be higher.Wait, no, actually, the exponential generating function approach counts the number of ways to distribute the rings into the fingers where the order on each finger matters. So, the number of arrangements is indeed ( 4^5 times 5! ) divided by something? Wait, no, actually, the exponential generating function for each finger is ( sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{x^k}{k!} ) because the number of ways to arrange k rings on a finger is ( k! ), so the EGF is ( e^x ). Therefore, for four fingers, the EGF is ( (e^x)^4 = e^{4x} ). The coefficient of ( x^5 ) in this is ( frac{4^5}{5!} ), so the number of arrangements is ( 5! times frac{4^5}{5!} = 4^5 = 1024 ). But that contradicts my earlier thought that the number should be higher because of the ordering.Wait, I think I'm confusing ordinary generating functions with exponential generating functions. Let me clarify.In the exponential generating function approach, each finger can have any number of rings, and the number of ways to arrange k rings on a finger is ( k! ), so the EGF for one finger is ( sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{k! x^k}{k!} = sum_{k=0}^{infty} x^k = frac{1}{1 - x} ). Wait, that's not correct because ( sum_{k=0}^{infty} x^k = frac{1}{1 - x} ), but that's the ordinary generating function. The exponential generating function for one finger would be ( sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{k! x^k}{k!} = sum_{k=0}^{infty} x^k = frac{1}{1 - x} ). So, for four fingers, the EGF is ( left( frac{1}{1 - x} right)^4 ).The coefficient of ( x^5 ) in ( left( frac{1}{1 - x} right)^4 ) is ( binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = binom{8}{3} = 56 ). But since we're dealing with exponential generating functions, the number of arrangements is ( 5! times 56 = 120 times 56 = 6720 ).Wait, that makes more sense. So, the number of arrangements is 6720. But let me verify this with another approach.Another way to think about it is that for each ring, we can assign it to one of the four fingers, and then for each finger, we can arrange the rings in some order. So, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible distributions of the rings to the fingers, multiplied by the number of orderings for each distribution.The number of distributions is the number of ways to assign five distinguishable rings to four distinguishable fingers, which is ( 4^5 = 1024 ). For each distribution, where finger 1 has ( k_1 ) rings, finger 2 has ( k_2 ), etc., the number of orderings is ( k_1! times k_2! times k_3! times k_4! ). Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all distributions of ( k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4! ).But this sum is equal to ( 4^5 times 5! ) divided by something? Wait, no, actually, it's the same as the exponential generating function approach. The sum over all distributions of ( k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4! ) is equal to ( 5! times ) the coefficient of ( x^5 ) in ( (e^x)^4 ), which is ( 5! times frac{4^5}{5!} = 4^5 = 1024 ). Wait, that can't be right because earlier we had 6720.Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think step by step.Each arrangement consists of assigning each of the five rings to one of the four fingers, and then for each finger, arranging the rings in some order. So, for a specific distribution where finger 1 has ( k_1 ) rings, finger 2 has ( k_2 ), etc., the number of such arrangements is ( frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!} times (k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!) ) which simplifies to ( 5! times ) the number of such distributions.Wait, no, actually, ( frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!} ) is the multinomial coefficient, which counts the number of ways to assign the rings to the fingers given the distribution ( k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 ). Then, for each finger, the number of orderings is ( k_1! times k_2! times k_3! times k_4! ). So, the total number of arrangements for that distribution is ( frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!} times (k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!) = 5! times ) the number of distributions.Wait, no, that can't be because the multinomial coefficient multiplied by the product of the factorials would give ( 5! times ) the number of distributions, but the number of distributions is ( binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = 56 ) as before. So, the total number of arrangements is ( 5! times 56 = 6720 ).But earlier, I thought of assigning each ring to a finger and then ordering them, which would be ( 4^5 times ) something. Wait, actually, no, because when you assign each ring to a finger, the order on each finger is independent, so it's not just ( 4^5 ), but ( 4^5 times ) the number of orderings per finger.Wait, perhaps another way: for each finger, the number of possible arrangements is the sum over ( k ) from 0 to 5 of ( binom{5}{k} times k! ). But since we have four fingers, the total number is ( left( sum_{k=0}^{5} binom{5}{k} k! right)^4 ). But that doesn't seem right because it's the product over fingers, but the total number of rings is fixed at five.Wait, maybe I should think of it as arranging the five rings in sequence and then partitioning them into four ordered lists, one for each finger. The number of ways to arrange five rings is 5!, and the number of ways to partition them into four ordered lists is the number of compositions of 5 into four parts, which is ( binom{5 - 1}{4 - 1} = binom{4}{3} = 4 ). But that's for indistinct lists, but our fingers are distinct.Wait, no, actually, the number of ways to partition a sequence of n elements into k ordered lists is ( k^n ). Wait, no, that's not right. For each element, you can choose which list it goes into, so it's ( k^n ). But in our case, the lists are ordered, so it's more than that.Wait, actually, the number of ways to partition a sequence of n elements into k ordered lists is ( k! times S(n, k) ), where ( S(n, k) ) is the Stirling numbers of the second kind. But since the lists are ordered, it's ( k! times S(n, k) ). But in our case, the lists correspond to the fingers, which are distinguishable, so the order of the lists matters. Therefore, the number of ways is ( 4! times S(5, 4) ).But wait, no, because the order within each list matters as well. So, actually, the total number of arrangements is ( 4! times S(5, 4) times ) something. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.Let me try to recall the formula for the number of ways to distribute n distinguishable objects into k distinguishable boxes where the order in each box matters. The formula is ( k! times S(n, k) times ) something? Wait, no, actually, it's ( sum_{m=0}^{n} binom{n}{m} m! times ) something.Wait, I think I need to look up the formula, but since I can't, I'll try to derive it.Each arrangement can be thought of as a function from the set of rings to the set of fingers, and for each finger, the rings assigned to it are ordered. So, for each finger, the number of possible orderings is the number of permutations of the subset assigned to it.Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all possible distributions of the product of the permutations on each finger. So, for each distribution ( k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 ) where ( k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 5 ), the number of arrangements is ( frac{5!}{k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!} times (k_1! k_2! k_3! k_4!) ) which simplifies to ( 5! times ) the number of distributions.But the number of distributions is the number of ways to assign five distinguishable rings to four distinguishable fingers, which is ( 4^5 = 1024 ). Therefore, the total number of arrangements is ( 5! times 4^5 = 120 times 1024 = 122880 ).Wait, but earlier I thought it was 6720. Which one is correct?Wait, let's think of a smaller case. Suppose we have 2 rings and 2 fingers. How many arrangements are there?Using the first approach: for each distribution, the number of arrangements is ( frac{2!}{k_1! k_2!} times (k_1! k_2!) = 2! times ) number of distributions. The number of distributions is ( 2^2 = 4 ). So, total arrangements would be ( 2! times 4 = 8 ).But let's count manually. Each ring can go on finger 1 or finger 2, and on each finger, the order matters. So, for each ring, we assign it to a finger, and then for each finger, we arrange the rings in order.Possible assignments:1. Both rings on finger 1: There's only one way to assign both to finger 1, and the number of orderings is 2! = 2.2. Both rings on finger 2: Similarly, 2! = 2.3. One ring on finger 1 and one on finger 2: There are ( binom{2}{1} = 2 ) ways to assign which ring goes where, and for each finger, the single ring has only one ordering. So, total arrangements here are 2 × 1 × 1 = 2.Wait, but according to the first approach, the total should be 8, but when I count manually, I get 2 (both on 1) + 2 (both on 2) + 2 (split) = 6.Hmm, so the first approach overcounts. Therefore, my initial reasoning was wrong.Wait, so the correct count is 6, but according to the first approach, it was 8. So, the first approach is incorrect.Therefore, the correct way must be different. Let me think again.Each arrangement can be thought of as a permutation of the rings, with markers indicating where one finger ends and the next begins. For two fingers, we can think of inserting a divider between the rings. For n rings, there are n-1 possible places to insert a divider, but since we have two fingers, we can choose to insert 0 or 1 dividers.Wait, no, actually, for two fingers, each arrangement is a permutation of the rings, and then a decision on where to split them between the two fingers. So, for each permutation of the two rings, we can choose to put both on finger 1, both on finger 2, or split them. But since the order on each finger matters, splitting them would mean one on finger 1 and one on finger 2, but the order on each finger is just the single ring, so it's fixed.Wait, but in reality, the order on each finger is determined by the permutation. So, for each permutation of the two rings, we can choose to assign the first k rings to finger 1 and the rest to finger 2, for k = 0, 1, 2. So, for each permutation, there are 3 ways to split them between the two fingers. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 2! × 3 = 6, which matches the manual count.Therefore, in general, for n rings and k fingers, the number of arrangements is n! × (k + n - 1 choose n). Wait, no, in the case of two rings and two fingers, it's 2! × 3 = 6, which is 2! × (2 + 2 - 1 choose 2) = 2! × 3 choose 2 = 2! × 3 = 6. So, yes, that seems to hold.Wait, more generally, for n distinguishable rings and k distinguishable fingers, the number of arrangements where the order on each finger matters is ( n! times binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ). Wait, in the two-ring, two-finger case, that would be ( 2! times binom{2 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = 2 × 3 = 6 ), which is correct.Similarly, for three rings and two fingers, it would be ( 6 × binom{3 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = 6 × 4 = 24 ). Let's verify that manually.For three rings, each can be assigned to finger 1 or 2, and the order on each finger matters. The number of arrangements is the sum over k=0 to 3 of ( binom{3}{k} times k! times (3 - k)! ). For k=0: 1 × 1 × 6 = 6; k=1: 3 × 1 × 2 = 6; k=2: 3 × 2 × 1 = 6; k=3: 1 × 6 × 1 = 6. Total is 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24, which matches the formula.Therefore, the general formula is ( n! times binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ). So, in our original problem, n = 5 rings, k = 4 fingers. Therefore, the number of arrangements is ( 5! × binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = 120 × binom{8}{3} ).Calculating ( binom{8}{3} = 56 ). Therefore, the total number of arrangements is ( 120 × 56 = 6720 ).Wait, but earlier, when I thought of assigning each ring to a finger and then ordering them, I got 4^5 × something, which was 1024, but that was incorrect because it didn't account for the ordering correctly. The correct formula is ( n! × binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ), which in this case is 6720.Therefore, the number of arrangements is 6720. But wait, the problem says \\"given eight distinguishable rings,\\" but we're only arranging five of them. So, does that mean we first choose five rings out of eight and then arrange them on the four fingers?Oh! I completely missed that part. The problem says \\"given eight distinguishable rings,\\" so we have to choose five rings out of eight and then arrange them on the four fingers. So, the total number of arrangements is ( binom{8}{5} × 5! × binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} ).Wait, no, actually, the formula ( n! × binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ) already accounts for arranging n distinguishable objects on k distinguishable fingers with order on each finger. So, in our case, n = 5, k = 4, so it's 5! × 56 = 6720. But since we have eight rings, we need to choose five of them first, which is ( binom{8}{5} = 56 ). Therefore, the total number of arrangements is ( 56 × 6720 ).Wait, but that would be 56 × 6720 = 376,320. But that seems too high. Let me think again.Wait, no, actually, the formula ( n! × binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ) is the number of ways to arrange n distinguishable rings on k distinguishable fingers with order on each finger. So, if we have eight rings and we need to arrange five of them, the total number is ( binom{8}{5} × 5! × binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} ).But wait, no, actually, once we choose five rings out of eight, the number of arrangements is ( 5! × binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = 5! × 56 = 6720 ). Therefore, the total number of arrangements is ( binom{8}{5} × 6720 ).Calculating ( binom{8}{5} = 56 ). So, total arrangements = 56 × 6720 = 376,320.But wait, let me verify this with another approach. The total number of ways to choose five rings out of eight is ( binom{8}{5} = 56 ). For each such selection, the number of ways to arrange them on four fingers with order on each finger is 6720. Therefore, total arrangements = 56 × 6720 = 376,320.But let me think if that's correct. Alternatively, we can think of it as first assigning each of the eight rings to either be used or not, and then arranging the selected five on the fingers. But that's more complicated.Alternatively, the total number of arrangements is the number of injective functions from the five positions to the eight rings, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange them on the fingers. Wait, no, because we're selecting five rings out of eight, and then arranging them.Wait, actually, the number of ways to choose five rings out of eight and then arrange them on four fingers with order on each finger is ( binom{8}{5} × 5! × binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} ). But that's the same as ( binom{8}{5} × 6720 ), which is 56 × 6720 = 376,320.But wait, let me think differently. For each ring, we can decide whether to include it or not, but since we need exactly five rings, it's ( binom{8}{5} ) ways to choose them. Then, for each chosen set of five rings, the number of ways to arrange them on four fingers with order on each finger is ( 4^5 × 5! ) divided by something? Wait, no, as we saw earlier, it's ( 5! × binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = 6720 ).Therefore, the total number is indeed 56 × 6720 = 376,320.Wait, but let me check the units. 56 is the number of ways to choose the rings, and 6720 is the number of ways to arrange each set of five rings on the fingers. So, yes, multiplying them gives the total number of arrangements.But wait, another way: for each of the eight rings, we can assign it to one of the four fingers or exclude it. But since we need exactly five rings, we have to assign five rings to the four fingers, considering order on each finger, and exclude the remaining three.So, the number of ways is the number of ways to assign five distinguishable rings to four distinguishable fingers with order on each finger, multiplied by the number of ways to choose which five rings to use. So, that's ( binom{8}{5} × ) (number of arrangements of five rings on four fingers with order).As calculated earlier, the number of arrangements is 6720, so total is 56 × 6720 = 376,320.But wait, let me think if this is correct. Alternatively, for each ring, we can decide whether to include it or not, and if included, assign it to one of the four fingers and determine its position on that finger.But the problem is that the order on each finger is significant, so for each finger, the rings on it must be ordered. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the sum over all subsets of five rings of the number of ways to arrange them on the four fingers with order.Which is exactly ( binom{8}{5} × ) (number of arrangements of five rings on four fingers with order) = 56 × 6720 = 376,320.Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 376,320.But wait, let me check if 6720 is correct for arranging five rings on four fingers with order. Earlier, we saw that for two rings and two fingers, it's 6, which matches the formula 2! × 3 = 6. For three rings and two fingers, it's 6 × 4 = 24, which also matches. So, for five rings and four fingers, it's 5! × 56 = 6720. So, that seems correct.Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 56 × 6720 = 376,320.But wait, let me calculate 56 × 6720:56 × 6000 = 336,00056 × 720 = 40,320So, total is 336,000 + 40,320 = 376,320.Yes, that's correct.But the problem says \\"the leftmost three nonzero digits of n\\". So, n = 376,320. The leftmost three nonzero digits are 376.Wait, but let me confirm if my reasoning is correct because earlier I thought of 4^5 × 5! which was 1024 × 120 = 122,880, but that was without considering the selection of five rings out of eight. So, 122,880 is the number of arrangements for five specific rings, but since we have eight rings, we have to choose five, which is 56, so 56 × 122,880 = 6,883,200. But that contradicts the earlier result.Wait, no, that can't be right because 4^5 × 5! is the number of arrangements for five specific rings, but when we have eight rings, we have to choose five, and for each choice, the number of arrangements is 4^5 × 5!. But that would be ( binom{8}{5} × 4^5 × 5! ) which is 56 × 1024 × 120. Wait, that's way too high.Wait, no, actually, when we choose five rings out of eight, the number of ways to arrange them on four fingers with order is not 4^5 × 5! because that would be assigning each ring to a finger and then ordering all of them, which is incorrect.Wait, no, actually, the correct number of arrangements for five specific rings on four fingers with order is 5! × binom{5 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = 6720, as we calculated earlier. Therefore, the total number is 56 × 6720 = 376,320.Therefore, the leftmost three nonzero digits are 376.But wait, let me think again. The formula ( n! × binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} ) is for arranging n distinguishable objects into k distinguishable boxes with order in each box. So, for n=5, k=4, it's 5! × 56 = 6720. Then, since we have eight rings, we choose five, which is 56, so total arrangements are 56 × 6720 = 376,320.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the leftmost three nonzero digits of n are 376."},{"question":"Given that F is the focus of the parabola C:y^{2}=2pxleft(p gt 0right), and the line l passing through point F with a slope of 2 intersects C at points A and B. If |AF|cdot |BF|=20, find the value of p.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a parabola and a line intersecting it. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to find.First, the parabola is given by the equation ( y^2 = 2px ) where ( p > 0 ). I remember that for a parabola in the form ( y^2 = 4ax ), the focus is at ( (a, 0) ). Comparing that to our equation, ( y^2 = 2px ), it seems like ( 4a = 2p ), so ( a = frac{p}{2} ). Therefore, the focus ( F ) of this parabola should be at ( left( frac{p}{2}, 0 right) ). Let me write that down:Focus ( F ) is at ( left( frac{p}{2}, 0 right) ).Next, there's a line ( l ) passing through point ( F ) with a slope of 2. So, the equation of line ( l ) should be something like ( y = 2x + c ). Since it passes through ( F ), I can plug in the coordinates of ( F ) into this equation to find ( c ).Let me do that. Plugging ( x = frac{p}{2} ) and ( y = 0 ) into ( y = 2x + c ):( 0 = 2 cdot frac{p}{2} + c )Simplifying:( 0 = p + c ) => ( c = -p )So, the equation of line ( l ) is ( y = 2x - p ).Now, this line intersects the parabola ( C ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). I need to find the coordinates of these points. To do this, I can solve the system of equations consisting of the parabola and the line.So, substituting ( y = 2x - p ) into ( y^2 = 2px ):( (2x - p)^2 = 2px )Let me expand the left side:( (2x - p)^2 = 4x^2 - 4px + p^2 )So, the equation becomes:( 4x^2 - 4px + p^2 = 2px )Let me bring all terms to one side:( 4x^2 - 4px + p^2 - 2px = 0 )Combine like terms:( 4x^2 - 6px + p^2 = 0 )So, this is a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ). Let me write it as:( 4x^2 - 6px + p^2 = 0 )I can try to solve this quadratic for ( x ). Let me use the quadratic formula:For ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), solutions are ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Here, ( a = 4 ), ( b = -6p ), and ( c = p^2 ).So, discriminant ( D = b^2 - 4ac = (-6p)^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot p^2 = 36p^2 - 16p^2 = 20p^2 )Therefore, the solutions are:( x = frac{6p pm sqrt{20p^2}}{8} )Simplify the square root:( sqrt{20p^2} = sqrt{20} cdot p = 2sqrt{5}p )So, substituting back:( x = frac{6p pm 2sqrt{5}p}{8} )Factor out 2p from numerator:( x = frac{2p(3 pm sqrt{5})}{8} = frac{p(3 pm sqrt{5})}{4} )So, the x-coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ) are ( frac{p(3 + sqrt{5})}{4} ) and ( frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{4} ).Now, let's find the corresponding y-coordinates using the equation of line ( l ): ( y = 2x - p ).For ( x = frac{p(3 + sqrt{5})}{4} ):( y = 2 cdot frac{p(3 + sqrt{5})}{4} - p = frac{p(3 + sqrt{5})}{2} - p = frac{p(3 + sqrt{5} - 2)}{2} = frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} )Similarly, for ( x = frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{4} ):( y = 2 cdot frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{4} - p = frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{2} - p = frac{p(3 - sqrt{5} - 2)}{2} = frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{2} )Therefore, points ( A ) and ( B ) are:( A left( frac{p(3 + sqrt{5})}{4}, frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} right) )( B left( frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{4}, frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{2} right) )Now, I need to find the distances ( |AF| ) and ( |BF| ), then compute their product, which is given as 20.First, let's find ( |AF| ). Point ( F ) is at ( left( frac{p}{2}, 0 right) ). So, the distance between ( A ) and ( F ) can be found using the distance formula:( |AF| = sqrt{ left( frac{p(3 + sqrt{5})}{4} - frac{p}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} - 0 right)^2 } )Let me compute each part step by step.First, the x-coordinate difference:( frac{p(3 + sqrt{5})}{4} - frac{p}{2} = frac{p(3 + sqrt{5})}{4} - frac{2p}{4} = frac{p(3 + sqrt{5} - 2)}{4} = frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{4} )The y-coordinate difference is:( frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} - 0 = frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} )So, plugging back into the distance formula:( |AF| = sqrt{ left( frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{4} right)^2 + left( frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} right)^2 } )Let me compute each square:First term:( left( frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{4} right)^2 = frac{p^2(1 + 2sqrt{5} + 5)}{16} = frac{p^2(6 + 2sqrt{5})}{16} = frac{p^2(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} )Second term:( left( frac{p(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} right)^2 = frac{p^2(1 + 2sqrt{5} + 5)}{4} = frac{p^2(6 + 2sqrt{5})}{4} = frac{p^2(3 + sqrt{5})}{2} )So, adding these two terms:( frac{p^2(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} + frac{p^2(3 + sqrt{5})}{2} = frac{p^2(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} + frac{4p^2(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} = frac{5p^2(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} )Therefore, ( |AF| = sqrt{ frac{5p^2(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} } )Simplify the square root:( |AF| = p sqrt{ frac{5(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} } )Similarly, let's compute ( |BF| ).Point ( B ) is ( left( frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{4}, frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{2} right) )Distance from ( B ) to ( F ):( |BF| = sqrt{ left( frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{4} - frac{p}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{2} - 0 right)^2 } )Compute x-coordinate difference:( frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{4} - frac{p}{2} = frac{p(3 - sqrt{5})}{4} - frac{2p}{4} = frac{p(3 - sqrt{5} - 2)}{4} = frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{4} )Y-coordinate difference:( frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{2} - 0 = frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{2} )So, distance ( |BF| ):( |BF| = sqrt{ left( frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{4} right)^2 + left( frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{2} right)^2 } )Compute each square:First term:( left( frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{4} right)^2 = frac{p^2(1 - 2sqrt{5} + 5)}{16} = frac{p^2(6 - 2sqrt{5})}{16} = frac{p^2(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} )Second term:( left( frac{p(1 - sqrt{5})}{2} right)^2 = frac{p^2(1 - 2sqrt{5} + 5)}{4} = frac{p^2(6 - 2sqrt{5})}{4} = frac{p^2(3 - sqrt{5})}{2} )Adding these two terms:( frac{p^2(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} + frac{p^2(3 - sqrt{5})}{2} = frac{p^2(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} + frac{4p^2(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} = frac{5p^2(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} )Therefore, ( |BF| = sqrt{ frac{5p^2(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} } )Simplify the square root:( |BF| = p sqrt{ frac{5(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} } )Now, I need to compute the product ( |AF| cdot |BF| ).So, let's write:( |AF| cdot |BF| = left( p sqrt{ frac{5(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} } right) cdot left( p sqrt{ frac{5(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} } right) )Multiply the terms:First, multiply the constants:( p cdot p = p^2 )Multiply the square roots:( sqrt{ frac{5(3 + sqrt{5})}{8} } cdot sqrt{ frac{5(3 - sqrt{5})}{8} } = sqrt{ frac{5(3 + sqrt{5}) cdot 5(3 - sqrt{5})}{8 cdot 8} } = sqrt{ frac{25(9 - 5)}{64} } )Wait, let me compute the numerator inside the square root:( 5(3 + sqrt{5}) cdot 5(3 - sqrt{5}) = 25 cdot (3 + sqrt{5})(3 - sqrt{5}) )Compute ( (3 + sqrt{5})(3 - sqrt{5}) = 9 - ( sqrt{5} )^2 = 9 - 5 = 4 )So, numerator becomes ( 25 cdot 4 = 100 )Denominator is ( 8 cdot 8 = 64 )Therefore, the square root becomes:( sqrt{ frac{100}{64} } = frac{10}{8} = frac{5}{4} )So, putting it all together:( |AF| cdot |BF| = p^2 cdot frac{5}{4} = frac{5p^2}{4} )We are given that ( |AF| cdot |BF| = 20 ). So,( frac{5p^2}{4} = 20 )Solve for ( p^2 ):Multiply both sides by 4:( 5p^2 = 80 )Divide both sides by 5:( p^2 = 16 )Since ( p > 0 ), take the positive square root:( p = 4 )So, the value of ( p ) is 4.**Final Answer**The value of ( p ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"In a chess tournament, each participant played one game with every other participant.

If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2}, then the sum of all elements in A*B is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to define an operation between two sets A and B. The operation is denoted by *, and it's defined as A*B = {x | x = x₁ + x₂, where x₁ is in A and x₂ is in B}. Then, I'm given that A is {1, 2, 3} and B is {1, 2}. The question is asking for the sum of all elements in A*B. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what A*B actually is. It's the set of all possible sums you can get by adding an element from A and an element from B. So, for each element in A, I have to add it to each element in B, and then collect all those sums into a new set. After that, I need to find the sum of all the unique elements in that new set.Alright, let's break it down. Let me write down the elements of set A and set B:Set A: {1, 2, 3}Set B: {1, 2}So, A*B should be all possible sums where one number is from A and the other is from B. Let me list out all the possible combinations:1 (from A) + 1 (from B) = 21 (from A) + 2 (from B) = 32 (from A) + 1 (from B) = 32 (from A) + 2 (from B) = 43 (from A) + 1 (from B) = 43 (from A) + 2 (from B) = 5So, if I list all these sums, I get: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5.But wait, A*B is a set, which means it only contains unique elements. So, I need to remove the duplicates from this list. Let me write down the unique sums:2, 3, 4, 5.So, A*B = {2, 3, 4, 5}.Now, the problem is asking for the sum of all elements in A*B. That means I need to add up 2, 3, 4, and 5.Let me calculate that:2 + 3 = 55 + 4 = 99 + 5 = 14So, the sum is 14.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Is A*B correctly calculated? Let me go through each element in A and add it to each element in B again:- 1 + 1 = 2- 1 + 2 = 3- 2 + 1 = 3- 2 + 2 = 4- 3 + 1 = 4- 3 + 2 = 5Yes, that's correct. So the unique sums are 2, 3, 4, 5, which add up to 14. Hmm, seems straightforward.But just to be thorough, let me think about another way to approach this. Maybe instead of listing all the sums, I can find a formula or a smarter way to compute the sum of all elements in A*B without listing them all out. That might be helpful if the sets were larger.So, the operation A*B is called the Minkowski sum of sets A and B. The Minkowski sum of two sets is the set of all possible sums of their elements. Now, the sum of all elements in A*B can be thought of as the sum over all x in A*B of x. But since A*B is constructed by adding every element of A to every element of B, maybe there's a relationship between the sums of A and B and the sum of A*B.Let me denote S_A as the sum of elements in A, and S_B as the sum of elements in B. Then, S_A = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and S_B = 1 + 2 = 3.Now, if I think about how many times each element of A is added to each element of B, each element of A is added to each element of B exactly once. So, each element of A is added |B| times, where |B| is the number of elements in B. Similarly, each element of B is added |A| times.Therefore, the total sum of all elements in A*B would be |B| * S_A + |A| * S_B.Let me compute that:|B| is 2, so 2 * S_A = 2 * 6 = 12|A| is 3, so 3 * S_B = 3 * 3 = 9Total sum = 12 + 9 = 21Wait, hold on. That's different from the 14 I got earlier. That can't be right. There must be a mistake in my reasoning here.Wait a second, no. Because when I compute the sum of all elements in A*B, I have to consider that A*B is a set, not a multiset. So, in the Minkowski sum, duplicates are only counted once. Therefore, the formula |B| * S_A + |A| * S_B gives the sum of all elements in the multiset, not the set. So, that approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for duplicates.So, in this case, since A*B is a set, we have to consider only unique sums. Therefore, the initial method of listing all possible sums and then removing duplicates is the correct approach, even though it's more tedious.So, going back, A*B is {2, 3, 4, 5}, and the sum is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.Therefore, the answer is 14.But just to make sure, let me think again. Maybe I can find another way to compute the sum without listing all elements, but taking into account the uniqueness.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the sum of all possible sums, which would be |A| * |B| times the average of the sums or something like that. But no, that might not account for the uniqueness.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the minimum and maximum elements in A*B and see if the set is a consecutive sequence or not.In this case, the minimum element in A*B is 1 + 1 = 2, and the maximum is 3 + 2 = 5. So, the elements are 2, 3, 4, 5, which is a consecutive sequence from 2 to 5. Therefore, the sum is the sum of consecutive integers from 2 to 5.The formula for the sum of consecutive integers from a to b is (b - a + 1) * (a + b) / 2.So, here, a = 2, b = 5.Number of terms = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4Sum = 4 * (2 + 5) / 2 = 4 * 7 / 2 = 14.So, that's another way to compute it, and it also gives 14. So, that confirms my initial answer.Therefore, I can be confident that the sum of all elements in A*B is 14.**Final Answer**The sum of all elements in (A * B) is boxed{14}."},{"question":"Papa Carlo has 130 planks. He can make a toy windmill with 5 planks, a steamboat with 7 planks, and an airplane with 14 planks. The airplane is worth 19 gold coins, the steamboat is worth 8 gold coins, and the windmill is worth 6 gold coins. What is the maximum number of gold coins Papa Carlo can earn?","answer":"Alright, so Papa Carlo has 130 planks, and he wants to make toys to earn as many gold coins as possible. He can make windmills, steamboats, and airplanes, each requiring different numbers of planks and giving different amounts of gold coins. I need to figure out how he can maximize his gold coins.First, let me list out the details:- **Windmill**: 5 planks, 6 gold coins.- **Steamboat**: 7 planks, 8 gold coins.- **Airplane**: 14 planks, 19 gold coins.He has 130 planks in total. So, the goal is to maximize the total gold coins, given the constraints on the number of planks.Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem. Maybe linear programming? But since we're dealing with integers (you can't make a fraction of a toy), it's more like an integer linear programming problem. But maybe I can approach it step by step without getting too complicated.Let me think about the value per plank for each toy. That might help prioritize which toys are more profitable per plank.- **Windmill**: 6 gold / 5 planks = 1.2 gold per plank.- **Steamboat**: 8 gold / 7 planks ≈ 1.14 gold per plank.- **Airplane**: 19 gold / 14 planks ≈ 1.357 gold per plank.So, the airplane has the highest value per plank, followed by the windmill, then the steamboat. So, to maximize gold coins, he should probably make as many airplanes as possible, then windmills, and then steamboats with the remaining planks.But let me verify if that's the case because sometimes even if one item has a higher value per unit, the combination of other items might yield a better total.Let me try to calculate how many airplanes he can make. Each airplane uses 14 planks.130 divided by 14 is approximately 9.28. So, he can make 9 airplanes, which would use 9*14=126 planks. Then he would have 130-126=4 planks left. But 4 planks aren't enough to make a windmill (which needs 5) or a steamboat (which needs 7). So, he can't make any other toys with the remaining planks. So, 9 airplanes would give him 9*19=171 gold coins.Alternatively, what if he makes 8 airplanes? That would use 8*14=112 planks. Then he has 130-112=18 planks left.With 18 planks, what can he make? Let's see:- Steamboats: 18 /7 ≈2.57, so 2 steamboats would use 14 planks, leaving 4 planks, which isn't enough for anything else. So, 2 steamboats give 2*8=16 gold coins, plus 8 airplanes give 152, total 168.Alternatively, with 18 planks, he could make 3 windmills, which would use 3*5=15 planks, leaving 3 planks. 3 windmills give 3*6=18 gold coins, plus 8 airplanes give 152, total 170.Alternatively, maybe a combination of windmills and steamboats with 18 planks.Let's see: 18 planks.If he makes 1 steamboat (7 planks) and then 11 planks left. 11 planks can make 2 windmills (10 planks), leaving 1 plank. So, 1 steamboat and 2 windmills: 8 + 12 = 20 gold coins. Plus 8 airplanes: 152. Total 172.Wait, that's better than 168 and 170. So, 172.Wait, 1 steamboat and 2 windmills: 7 + 10 = 17 planks. Wait, 18-17=1 plank left. So, that's correct.Alternatively, 2 steamboats would use 14 planks, leaving 4 planks, which isn't enough for a windmill. So, 2 steamboats give 16, plus 8 airplanes give 152, total 168.So, 1 steamboat and 2 windmills give 20, which is better.Alternatively, 3 windmills: 15 planks, leaving 3. So, 18 gold coins, which is less than 20.So, 1 steamboat and 2 windmills give more.So, 8 airplanes, 1 steamboat, 2 windmills: total planks 112 +7 +10=129, leaving 1 plank unused. Total gold coins: 152 +8 +12=172.Alternatively, is there a better combination with 18 planks?Wait, 18 planks.If he makes 1 airplane, that would use 14 planks, leaving 4. But 4 isn't enough for anything else. So, 1 airplane gives 19, but 19 is more than 20? No, 19 is less than 20. So, 1 steamboat and 2 windmills give more.So, 172 is better.Alternatively, 18 planks: 3 windmills (15 planks) and 1 plank left. 18 gold coins, which is less than 20.So, 172 is the maximum with 8 airplanes.Wait, but 172 is less than the 171 from 9 airplanes? Wait, 172 is more than 171. So, 172 is better.Wait, 9 airplanes give 171, but 8 airplanes plus 1 steamboat and 2 windmills give 172. So, 172 is better.So, maybe making 8 airplanes is better than 9.Wait, let me check:9 airplanes: 126 planks, 4 left. 9*19=171.8 airplanes: 112 planks, 18 left. 18 can be used for 1 steamboat and 2 windmills: 8 + 12=20. So, total 152 +20=172.So, 172 is better.Wait, so 8 airplanes, 1 steamboat, 2 windmills: total planks 112 +7 +10=129, 1 plank unused. Total gold coins 172.Is there a way to use that last plank? Probably not, since all toys require at least 5 planks.Alternatively, can he make more toys by reducing the number of airplanes further?Let's try 7 airplanes: 7*14=98 planks. 130-98=32 planks left.With 32 planks, what can he make?Let me see:Maximizing value per plank, so windmill (1.2) and steamboat (1.14). So, windmill is better.32 planks: 32 /5=6.4, so 6 windmills would use 30 planks, leaving 2 planks. 6 windmills give 6*6=36 gold coins. Plus 7 airplanes: 7*19=133. Total: 133 +36=169.Alternatively, 32 planks: 4 steamboats would use 28 planks, leaving 4. 4 steamboats give 4*8=32. Plus 7 airplanes: 133.

Total 171.That's better than 169.Alternatively, 32 planks: 5 windmills (25) and 1 steamboat (7). So, same as above.Alternatively, 4 windmills (20) and 2 steamboats (14). 20 +14=34, which is over 32. So, not possible.Alternatively, 3 windmills (15) and 2 steamboats (14). 15 +14=29, leaving 3 planks. 3*6 +2*8=18 +16=34. Plus 7 airplanes: 133. Total: 167.So, 171 is the best with 7 airplanes.Wait, so 7 airplanes, 1 steamboat, 5 windmills: total planks 98 +7 +25=130. Perfect, no planks left.

Let's examine each tax bracket to see where this amount falls.1. **First Bracket (Up to 800 yuan):**   - No tax is applied here.2. **Second Bracket (800 to 4000 yuan):**   - Tax is 14% of the amount exceeding 800 yuan.   - Calculating the tax for this bracket: 14% of (4000 - 800) = 14% of 3200 = 448 yuan.   - Since 420 yuan is less than 448 yuan, the manuscript fee falls within this bracket.3. **Third Bracket (Above 4000 yuan):**   - Tax is 11% of the total manuscript fee.   - However, since the tax paid is 420 yuan, which is less than the tax for the second bracket, this bracket does not apply.Now, to find the exact manuscript fee in the second bracket:- Let ( x ) be the amount exceeding 800 yuan.- Tax equation: ( 0.14x = 420 )- Solving for ( x ): ( x = frac{420}{0.14} = 3000 ) yuan.Therefore, the total manuscript fee before tax is:- 800 yuan (untaxed amount) + 3000 yuan (taxable amount) = 3800 yuan."},{"question":"The maximum value of the function f(x) = sin(x + 2varphi) - 2sinvarphicos(x + varphi) is","answer":"Okay, so I have this function here: f(x) = sin(x + 2φ) - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ). I need to find its maximum value. Hmm, trigonometric functions can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can simplify this expression first.Let me write down the function again: f(x) = sin(x + 2φ) - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ). I wonder if I can use some trigonometric identities to simplify this. I remember that sin(A + B) can be expanded, so maybe I can expand sin(x + 2φ) first.Using the identity sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB, so sin(x + 2φ) would be sinx cos2φ + cosx sin2φ. Let me write that down:sin(x + 2φ) = sinx cos2φ + cosx sin2φ.Okay, so substituting back into f(x), we have:f(x) = [sinx cos2φ + cosx sin2φ] - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ).Now, let's look at the second term: -2 sinφ cos(x + φ). Maybe I can expand cos(x + φ) as well. Using the identity cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB, so cos(x + φ) = cosx cosφ - sinx sinφ. Therefore, the second term becomes:-2 sinφ [cosx cosφ - sinx sinφ] = -2 sinφ cosx cosφ + 2 sin²φ sinx.So, putting it all together, f(x) becomes:f(x) = sinx cos2φ + cosx sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosx cosφ + 2 sin²φ sinx.Now, let's combine like terms. Let's collect the terms with sinx and the terms with cosx.First, the sinx terms:sinx cos2φ + 2 sin²φ sinx.And the cosx terms:cosx sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosx cosφ.Let me factor out sinx and cosx from these groups.For sinx:sinx [cos2φ + 2 sin²φ].For cosx:cosx [sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosφ].Hmm, now I can simplify these expressions inside the brackets.Starting with the sinx term: cos2φ + 2 sin²φ.I remember that cos2φ can be written as 1 - 2 sin²φ. Let me substitute that:cos2φ + 2 sin²φ = (1 - 2 sin²φ) + 2 sin²φ = 1.Oh, that's nice! So the coefficient of sinx is 1.Now, the cosx term: sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosφ.I also remember that sin2φ = 2 sinφ cosφ. So substituting that:sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosφ = 2 sinφ cosφ - 2 sinφ cosφ = 0.Wow, so the coefficient of cosx is 0.Therefore, the function simplifies to:f(x) = sinx * 1 + cosx * 0 = sinx.Wait, so f(x) simplifies to sinx? That seems too simple. Let me double-check my steps.Starting from f(x) = sin(x + 2φ) - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ).Expanded sin(x + 2φ) correctly: sinx cos2φ + cosx sin2φ.Expanded cos(x + φ) correctly: cosx cosφ - sinx sinφ.Then multiplied by -2 sinφ: -2 sinφ cosx cosφ + 2 sin²φ sinx.Then combined terms:sinx [cos2φ + 2 sin²φ] + cosx [sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosφ].Simplified cos2φ + 2 sin²φ to 1, and sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosφ to 0.So yes, f(x) = sinx. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is the maximum value of sinx, which is 1.But wait, is that really the case? Let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the simplification?Wait, let me go back to the step where I expanded sin(x + 2φ). Is that correct?Yes, sin(x + 2φ) = sinx cos2φ + cosx sin2φ.And cos(x + φ) = cosx cosφ - sinx sinφ, correct.Then, multiplying by -2 sinφ: -2 sinφ cosx cosφ + 2 sin²φ sinx, correct.Then combining sinx terms: sinx cos2φ + 2 sin²φ sinx.And cosx terms: cosx sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosx cosφ.Then for sinx: cos2φ + 2 sin²φ.Using the identity cos2φ = 1 - 2 sin²φ, so 1 - 2 sin²φ + 2 sin²φ = 1, correct.For cosx: sin2φ - 2 sinφ cosφ.But sin2φ = 2 sinφ cosφ, so 2 sinφ cosφ - 2 sinφ cosφ = 0, correct.So f(x) = sinx. Therefore, the maximum value is indeed 1.Wait, but the function is f(x) = sinx, so its maximum is 1. But let me think, is this possible? Because the original function had φ in it, but after simplifying, φ canceled out. So regardless of φ, the function reduces to sinx, whose maximum is 1.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by using another identity or method.Let me consider f(x) = sin(x + 2φ) - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ). Maybe I can write this as a single sine function or something similar.Alternatively, I can think of this as f(x) = sin(x + 2φ) - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ). Maybe I can use the identity for sinA - sinB or something else.Wait, let me see:We have sin(x + 2φ) - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ). Maybe I can express sin(x + 2φ) as sin[(x + φ) + φ]. So that would be sin[(x + φ) + φ] = sin(x + φ)cosφ + cos(x + φ)sinφ.So, sin(x + 2φ) = sin(x + φ)cosφ + cos(x + φ)sinφ.Therefore, substituting back into f(x):f(x) = [sin(x + φ)cosφ + cos(x + φ)sinφ] - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ).Simplify:= sin(x + φ)cosφ + cos(x + φ)sinφ - 2 sinφ cos(x + φ).Combine like terms:= sin(x + φ)cosφ + [sinφ - 2 sinφ] cos(x + φ).= sin(x + φ)cosφ - sinφ cos(x + φ).Hmm, so f(x) = sin(x + φ)cosφ - sinφ cos(x + φ).Wait, that looks like the sine of a difference. Because sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB.So, comparing:sin(x + φ)cosφ - sinφ cos(x + φ) = sin[(x + φ) - φ] = sinx.Yes! So f(x) = sinx. Therefore, the maximum value is 1.So, regardless of the approach, I end up with f(x) = sinx, so the maximum is 1.Wait, but just to make sure, let me plug in some specific values.Suppose φ = 0. Then f(x) = sin(x + 0) - 2*0*cos(x + 0) = sinx - 0 = sinx. So maximum is 1.If φ = π/2, then f(x) = sin(x + π) - 2*1*cos(x + π/2).sin(x + π) = -sinx, and cos(x + π/2) = -sinx.So f(x) = -sinx - 2*(-sinx) = -sinx + 2 sinx = sinx. Again, maximum is 1.Another test: φ = π/4.f(x) = sin(x + π/2) - 2*(√2/2)*cos(x + π/4).sin(x + π/2) = cosx.cos(x + π/4) = cosx cosπ/4 - sinx sinπ/4 = (√2/2)(cosx - sinx).So f(x) = cosx - 2*(√2/2)*(√2/2)(cosx - sinx).Simplify:= cosx - (√2/2)*(√2)(cosx - sinx).√2/2 * √2 = (2)/2 = 1.So f(x) = cosx - (cosx - sinx) = cosx - cosx + sinx = sinx.Again, f(x) = sinx. So maximum is 1.Therefore, regardless of φ, f(x) simplifies to sinx, so the maximum value is 1.I think that's solid. So the answer is 1.**Final Answer**The maximum value of the function is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given that the graph of the exponential function f(x) passes through the point (3, 8), find the value of f(6).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where the graph of an exponential function f(x) passes through the point (3, 8). I need to find the value of f(6). Hmm, exponential functions... I remember they have the form f(x) = ab^x, where a and b are constants. First, let me recall what an exponential function looks like. It's a function where the variable is in the exponent, right? So, unlike a linear function where the variable is in the base, here it's in the exponent. The general form is f(x) = ab^x, where 'a' is the initial value when x=0, and 'b' is the base, which determines if it's growing or decaying. If b > 1, it's exponential growth, and if 0 < b < 1, it's exponential decay.Since the function passes through (3, 8), that means when x = 3, f(x) = 8. So, plugging that into the equation, I get 8 = ab^3. But wait, I have two unknowns here: 'a' and 'b'. How can I find both with just one equation? Maybe I need another point or some additional information? The problem doesn't give me another point, so perhaps I need to make an assumption or find a relationship between 'a' and 'b'.Wait, maybe the function is of a simpler form? Sometimes, exponential functions are written as f(x) = a * b^x, but if it's a standard exponential function, maybe a is 1? No, that might not necessarily be the case. Or perhaps it's f(x) = b^x, so a is 1. Let me test that.If a is 1, then f(x) = b^x. Then, plugging in x=3, f(3) = b^3 = 8. So, solving for b, we get b = cube root of 8, which is 2. So, b=2. Therefore, the function would be f(x) = 2^x. Then, f(6) would be 2^6, which is 64. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but wait, is a necessarily 1?Wait, the problem says it's an exponential function, but doesn't specify whether it's of the form ab^x or just b^x. So, maybe I can't assume a is 1. That complicates things because with two unknowns, I can't solve for both with just one equation. So, perhaps I need more information or maybe the function is of a specific form.Wait, maybe the function is f(x) = a * 2^x, because 8 is 2^3, so if x=3, f(x)=8, which would make a=1. But that's assuming a=1, which might not be given. Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x) = 8 * (something)^x. Hmm, not sure.Wait, let me think again. The general form is f(x) = ab^x. We have one equation: 8 = ab^3. So, with two variables, a and b, we can't find unique values for both. So, maybe the problem expects a specific form, like f(x) = 2^x, which would make a=1. Alternatively, maybe the function is f(x) = 8^(x/3), because when x=3, it's 8^(1) = 8. Let me check that.If f(x) = 8^(x/3), then f(3) = 8^(1) = 8, which works. Then, f(6) would be 8^(6/3) = 8^2 = 64. So, same answer as before. Hmm, so whether I take f(x) = 2^x or f(x) = 8^(x/3), I get f(6) = 64.But wait, is that the only possibility? Or is there another function that passes through (3,8) and gives a different f(6)? For example, if I choose a different base, say b=4, then 8 = a*4^3 = a*64. So, a=8/64=1/8. Then, f(x) = (1/8)*4^x. Then, f(6) would be (1/8)*4^6 = (1/8)*4096 = 512. So, that's a different result.Wait, so depending on the base, I can get different values for f(6). So, how do I know which one is correct? The problem doesn't specify any other points or conditions, so maybe there's something else I'm missing.Wait, maybe the function is of the form f(x) = a * e^(kx), where e is the base of natural logarithms. Then, with f(3)=8, we have 8 = a*e^(3k). Again, two unknowns, a and k, so we can't solve uniquely.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to make an assumption that the function is of the form f(x) = 2^x, which is a common base. Then, f(6) would be 64. Alternatively, perhaps the function is f(x) = 8^(x/3), which also gives f(6)=64.Wait, but 2^x and 8^(x/3) are actually the same function, because 8 is 2^3, so 8^(x/3) = (2^3)^(x/3) = 2^(x). So, they are equivalent. So, that would mean that regardless of how I write it, as long as it's an exponential function passing through (3,8), and assuming the simplest form, f(6)=64.But earlier, I saw that if I choose a different base, like 4, I can get a different result. So, maybe the problem expects the simplest form, which is f(x)=2^x, leading to f(6)=64.Alternatively, perhaps the function is f(x)=8^(x/3), which is another way of writing 2^x, so same result.Wait, so maybe regardless of the base, as long as it's an exponential function passing through (3,8), f(6) is 64. Let me test that.Suppose f(x)=ab^x, and f(3)=8. So, 8=ab^3. Then, f(6)=ab^6. But ab^6 = (ab^3)^2 = 8^2 = 64. Oh! Wait, that's clever. So, regardless of the values of a and b, as long as ab^3=8, then ab^6=(ab^3)^2=8^2=64. So, f(6)=64.Oh, that's a neat trick. So, I don't actually need to know a and b individually. I can express f(6) in terms of f(3). Since f(6) = f(3)^2, because f(6) = ab^6 = (ab^3)^2 = f(3)^2. Since f(3)=8, f(6)=8^2=64.Wow, that's a much simpler way to look at it. So, regardless of the specific exponential function, as long as it passes through (3,8), f(6) will be 64.So, I think that's the answer. 64.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(6) ) is boxed{64}."},{"question":"In relation to Smiths Falls, Ontario, the local time in St. John's, Newfoundland, is 90 minutes ahead, and the local time in Whitehorse, Yukon, is 3 hours behind.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with expressions that need to be maximized or minimized under certain constraints, one common method is the method of Lagrange multipliers. But since I'm not too familiar with that, maybe I can try another approach. I also recall that quadratic forms and completing the square might be helpful here.Looking at the constraint equation: (x^{2} + 2x + frac{1}{5}y^{2} + 7z^{2} = 6). It seems like a quadratic in x, y, and z. Maybe I can rewrite this equation by completing the square for the x terms.So, let's focus on the x part: (x^{2} + 2x). To complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of x, which is 1, square it to get 1, and add and subtract it. So:(x^{2} + 2x = (x + 1)^2 - 1)So substituting back into the constraint equation:((x + 1)^2 - 1 + frac{1}{5}y^{2} + 7z^{2} = 6)Simplify that:((x + 1)^2 + frac{1}{5}y^{2} + 7z^{2} = 7)Okay, so now the constraint is rewritten as:((x + 1)^2 + frac{1}{5}y^{2} + 7z^{2} = 7)This looks like an ellipsoid centered at (-1, 0, 0) with different scaling along each axis.Now, the expression to maximize is (7x + 10y + z). Let me denote this as a linear function (f(x, y, z) = 7x + 10y + z).I remember that the maximum value of a linear function over an ellipsoid can be found using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The maximum value is the norm of the gradient vector of the function with respect to the metric defined by the ellipsoid.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as an inner product. Let me recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:For vectors ( mathbf{a} ) and ( mathbf{b} ), we have ( |mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b}| leq ||mathbf{a}|| cdot ||mathbf{b}|| ), with equality when ( mathbf{a} ) and ( mathbf{b} ) are scalar multiples.So, perhaps I can represent the constraint as a vector equation and the function as a dot product.Let me see. The constraint is:((x + 1)^2 + left( sqrt{frac{1}{5}} y right)^2 + left( sqrt{7} z right)^2 = 7)So, if I let ( u = x + 1 ), ( v = sqrt{frac{1}{5}} y ), and ( w = sqrt{7} z ), then the constraint becomes:(u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = 7)So, the point (u, v, w) lies on a sphere of radius ( sqrt{7} ).Now, let's express the function ( f(x, y, z) = 7x + 10y + z ) in terms of u, v, w.Since ( u = x + 1 ), so ( x = u - 1 ).( v = sqrt{frac{1}{5}} y ) implies ( y = sqrt{5} v ).( w = sqrt{7} z ) implies ( z = frac{w}{sqrt{7}} ).Substituting these into f:( f = 7(u - 1) + 10(sqrt{5} v) + frac{w}{sqrt{7}} )Simplify:( f = 7u - 7 + 10sqrt{5} v + frac{w}{sqrt{7}} )So, ( f = 7u + 10sqrt{5} v + frac{w}{sqrt{7}} - 7 )Now, the maximum of f occurs when the linear combination (7u + 10sqrt{5} v + frac{w}{sqrt{7}}) is maximized, since the -7 is a constant.So, let me denote the vector ( mathbf{a} = (7, 10sqrt{5}, frac{1}{sqrt{7}}) ) and the vector ( mathbf{b} = (u, v, w) ).Then, ( f = mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} - 7 ).By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:( |mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b}| leq ||mathbf{a}|| cdot ||mathbf{b}|| )Since ( ||mathbf{b}||^2 = u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = 7 ), so ( ||mathbf{b}|| = sqrt{7} ).Compute ( ||mathbf{a}|| ):( ||mathbf{a}|| = sqrt{7^2 + (10sqrt{5})^2 + left( frac{1}{sqrt{7}} right)^2} )Calculate each term:- (7^2 = 49)- ( (10sqrt{5})^2 = 100 times 5 = 500 )- ( left( frac{1}{sqrt{7}} right)^2 = frac{1}{7} )So, sum is (49 + 500 + frac{1}{7} = 549 + frac{1}{7} = frac{549 times 7 + 1}{7} = frac{3843 + 1}{7} = frac{3844}{7})Therefore, ( ||mathbf{a}|| = sqrt{frac{3844}{7}} = frac{sqrt{3844}}{sqrt{7}} )Wait, what's sqrt(3844)? Let me compute that.Well, 62^2 = 3844, because 60^2=3600, 62^2=3844.So, sqrt(3844)=62.Therefore, ( ||mathbf{a}|| = frac{62}{sqrt{7}} )Thus, the maximum value of ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} ) is ( ||mathbf{a}|| cdot ||mathbf{b}|| = frac{62}{sqrt{7}} times sqrt{7} = 62 )Therefore, the maximum value of f is (62 - 7 = 55).Wait, hold on. Because f = ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} - 7 ), so the maximum of f is 62 - 7 = 55.But let me double-check that.Wait, no, actually, the maximum of ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} ) is 62, so f is 62 - 7 = 55.But let me think again. Is that correct?Wait, no, hold on. Because f is (7u + 10sqrt{5} v + frac{w}{sqrt{7}} - 7). So, the maximum of the dot product is 62, so f_max = 62 - 7 = 55.Yes, that seems correct.But let me also check the Cauchy-Schwarz step.We have ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} leq ||mathbf{a}|| cdot ||mathbf{b}|| ). So, since ( ||mathbf{b}|| = sqrt{7} ), and ( ||mathbf{a}|| = frac{62}{sqrt{7}} ), then ( ||mathbf{a}|| cdot ||mathbf{b}|| = frac{62}{sqrt{7}} times sqrt{7} = 62 ). So, yes, the maximum of ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} ) is 62, so f_max is 62 - 7 = 55.Therefore, the maximum value M is 55.Now, when is this maximum attained? It's attained when ( mathbf{a} ) and ( mathbf{b} ) are scalar multiples. That is, when ( mathbf{b} = k mathbf{a} ) for some scalar k.So, ( u = 7k ), ( v = 10sqrt{5}k ), ( w = frac{k}{sqrt{7}} )But since ( u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = 7 ), substitute:( (7k)^2 + (10sqrt{5}k)^2 + left( frac{k}{sqrt{7}} right)^2 = 7 )Compute each term:- ( (7k)^2 = 49k^2 )- ( (10sqrt{5}k)^2 = 100 times 5 k^2 = 500k^2 )- ( left( frac{k}{sqrt{7}} right)^2 = frac{k^2}{7} )So, sum is (49k^2 + 500k^2 + frac{k^2}{7} = (49 + 500 + frac{1}{7})k^2 = frac{3844}{7}k^2)Set equal to 7:( frac{3844}{7}k^2 = 7 )Multiply both sides by 7:( 3844k^2 = 49 )So, ( k^2 = frac{49}{3844} = frac{7^2}{62^2} ), so ( k = pm frac{7}{62} )Since we are looking for the maximum, which occurs when ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} ) is maximum, which is when ( k ) is positive. So, ( k = frac{7}{62} )Therefore, the values of u, v, w are:- ( u = 7k = 7 times frac{7}{62} = frac{49}{62} )- ( v = 10sqrt{5}k = 10sqrt{5} times frac{7}{62} = frac{70sqrt{5}}{62} = frac{35sqrt{5}}{31} )- ( w = frac{k}{sqrt{7}} = frac{7}{62sqrt{7}} = frac{sqrt{7}}{62} )Now, recall that:- ( u = x + 1 ), so ( x = u - 1 = frac{49}{62} - 1 = frac{49 - 62}{62} = frac{-13}{62} )- ( v = sqrt{frac{1}{5}} y ), so ( y = sqrt{5} v = sqrt{5} times frac{35sqrt{5}}{31} = frac{35 times 5}{31} = frac{175}{31} )- ( w = sqrt{7} z ), so ( z = frac{w}{sqrt{7}} = frac{sqrt{7}}{62 sqrt{7}} = frac{1}{62} )So, the point where the maximum is attained is ( x = -frac{13}{62} ), ( y = frac{175}{31} ), ( z = frac{1}{62} )Let me verify that these values satisfy the original constraint.Compute ( x^2 + 2x + frac{1}{5}y^2 + 7z^2 ):First, compute each term:1. ( x^2 = left( -frac{13}{62} right)^2 = frac{169}{3844} )2. ( 2x = 2 times left( -frac{13}{62} right) = -frac{26}{62} = -frac{13}{31} )3. ( frac{1}{5} y^2 = frac{1}{5} times left( frac{175}{31} right)^2 = frac{1}{5} times frac{30625}{961} = frac{6125}{961} )4. ( 7z^2 = 7 times left( frac{1}{62} right)^2 = 7 times frac{1}{3844} = frac{7}{3844} )Now, sum all these up:( frac{169}{3844} - frac{13}{31} + frac{6125}{961} + frac{7}{3844} )First, let's convert all terms to have the same denominator, which is 3844.1. ( frac{169}{3844} ) stays the same.2. ( -frac{13}{31} = -frac{13 times 124}{31 times 124} = -frac{1612}{3844} )3. ( frac{6125}{961} = frac{6125 times 4}{961 times 4} = frac{24500}{3844} )4. ( frac{7}{3844} ) stays the same.Now, sum them:( frac{169 - 1612 + 24500 + 7}{3844} )Compute numerator:169 - 1612 = -1443-1443 + 24500 = 2305723057 + 7 = 23064So, total is ( frac{23064}{3844} )Simplify numerator and denominator:Divide numerator and denominator by 4:23064 ÷ 4 = 57663844 ÷ 4 = 961So, ( frac{5766}{961} )Wait, 961 is 31^2, and 5766 divided by 961:Compute 961 × 6 = 5766So, ( frac{5766}{961} = 6 )Therefore, the total is 6, which matches the original constraint. So, yes, these values satisfy the equation.Therefore, the maximum value M is 55, achieved when ( x = -frac{13}{62} ), ( y = frac{175}{31} ), and ( z = frac{1}{62} ).I think that's thorough. Let me just recap:1. Completed the square for x in the constraint.2. Transformed variables to turn the constraint into a sphere equation.3. Expressed the function to maximize in terms of the new variables.4. Applied Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find the maximum.5. Found the scalar multiple for equality condition.6.

A hundred million is 100,000,000. By dividing 1,234,000,000 by 100,000,000, I get 12.34. This means there are 12 full hundreds of millions in the number.Next, to find out how many tens of millions are in the remaining amount after accounting for the hundreds of millions, I take the decimal part of the previous division, which is 0.34, and multiply it by 100,000,000.

This is because the x-axis only varies along the x-direction, and the distance is measured perpendicular to the x-axis.So, plugging in the values, D equals the square root of (3 squared plus 4 squared), which is the square root of (9 + 16), resulting in the square root of 25, which is 5.Therefore, the distance from point P(1, 3, 4) to the x-axis is 5 units."},{"question":"A certain high school has 1000 seniors, 1200 juniors, and 1500 freshmen.

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, let me write down the equation to make it clearer:y = √(x - 24) + √(24 - x) - 8And I need to find ∛(x - 5y). So, essentially, I need to find the values of x and y first, right? Because without knowing x and y, I can't compute that cube root.Looking at the equation for y, I notice that there are two square roots: √(x - 24) and √(24 - x). Square roots can only be real numbers if the expressions inside them are non-negative. So, that gives me some constraints on x.Let me write down the conditions for the square roots to be real:1. x - 24 ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≥ 242. 24 - x ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≤ 24So, combining these two inequalities, x must be both greater than or equal to 24 and less than or equal to 24. That means x has to be exactly 24. Okay, that simplifies things a lot!So, x = 24. Now, let me plug that back into the equation for y.y = √(24 - 24) + √(24 - 24) - 8Simplifying inside the square roots:y = √(0) + √(0) - 8Which is:y = 0 + 0 - 8 = -8So, y equals -8. Now, I need to compute ∛(x - 5y). Let's plug in the values of x and y.First, compute x - 5y:x - 5y = 24 - 5*(-8)Multiplying 5 and -8:5*(-8) = -40So, substituting back:24 - (-40) = 24 + 40 = 64Therefore, x - 5y equals 64. Now, I need to find the cube root of 64.I remember that the cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. So, what number multiplied by itself three times equals 64?Well, 4*4*4 = 64, right? So, ∛64 = 4.Therefore, the cube root of (x - 5y) is 4.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I started by noting that the expressions inside the square roots must be non-negative, which led me to x = 24. That seems correct because x must be both ≥24 and ≤24.2. Plugging x = 24 into the equation for y: √(0) + √(0) -8 = -8. That makes sense.3. Then, computing x - 5y: 24 - 5*(-8) = 24 + 40 = 64. Yep, that's right.4. Finally, ∛64 is 4 because 4^3 = 64. That's correct.So, all my steps check out. I think I did this correctly. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.Just to recap:- Identified the domain restrictions on x due to the square roots, which forced x to be 24.- Substituted x = 24 into the equation for y, resulting in y = -8.- Calculated x - 5y, which gave 64.- Took the cube root of 64, which is 4.Therefore, the answer should be 4.**Final Answer**boxed{4}"},{"question":"The function g(x) = x^2 - 2013x, if g(a) = g(b), a neq b, then g(a + b) = boxed{？}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function g(x) = x² - 2013x, and I'm told that g(a) = g(b) with a not equal to b. I need to find g(a + b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, since g(a) equals g(b), that means when I plug in a and b into the function, I get the same result. So, mathematically, that would be:a² - 2013a = b² - 2013bHmm, okay. Let me write that down:a² - 2013a = b² - 2013bI can rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side. Let me subtract b² and add 2013b to both sides:a² - b² - 2013a + 2013b = 0Now, I notice that a² - b² is a difference of squares, which factors into (a - b)(a + b). Let me factor that part:(a - b)(a + b) - 2013(a - b) = 0Oh, look at that! Both terms have a common factor of (a - b). So, I can factor that out:(a - b)(a + b - 2013) = 0Now, since a ≠ b, the factor (a - b) is not zero. Therefore, the other factor must be zero:a + b - 2013 = 0So, solving for a + b:a + b = 2013Alright, so that gives me the sum of a and b. Now, the question asks for g(a + b). Since I know a + b is 2013, I can substitute that into the function g(x):g(a + b) = g(2013)Let me compute that:g(2013) = (2013)² - 2013*(2013)Wait, hold on. Let me compute that step by step. First, compute (2013)², which is 2013 multiplied by 2013. Then, subtract 2013 multiplied by 2013.But wait, that would be:(2013)² - (2013)² = 0So, g(2013) equals zero. Therefore, g(a + b) is zero.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from g(a) = g(b), I set up the equation correctly, factored it, and found that a + b = 2013. Then, substituting back into g(x), I indeed get zero because the two terms cancel each other out.Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the properties of quadratic functions. The function g(x) is a quadratic, so it's a parabola. Since it's a quadratic, it's symmetric about its vertex. The axis of symmetry is at x = -b/(2a) for a quadratic ax² + bx + c. In this case, a is 1 and b is -2013, so the axis of symmetry is at x = 2013/2.Wait, so if a and b are two different points where g(a) = g(b), then they must be symmetric around the vertex. That means the average of a and b is 2013/2, so (a + b)/2 = 2013/2, which implies a + b = 2013. That's consistent with what I found earlier.Therefore, a + b is indeed 2013, and plugging that back into g(x) gives zero. So, I think my answer is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"Let a=frac{3}{5} and let b=frac{2}{3}.

Squaring ( frac{3}{5} ) gives ( frac{9}{25} ).Then, I calculate ( b^{-3} ). Since ( b = frac{2}{3} ), its reciprocal is ( frac{3}{2} ). Raising this reciprocal to the power of 3 results in ( frac{27}{8} ).Finally, I multiply ( a^2 ) by ( b^{-3} ): ( frac{9}{25} times frac{27}{8} = frac{243}{200} )."},{"question":"Petya is creating a password for his smartphone. The password consists of 4 decimal digits. Petya wants the password to not contain the digit 7, and it must have at least two (or more) identical digits. How many ways can Petya create such a password?","answer":"Okay, so Petya is trying to create a password for his smartphone, and he has some specific requirements. The password needs to be 4 decimal digits, so each digit can be from 0 to 9. But there are two main constraints: first, the password shouldn't contain the digit 7 at all. Second, it must have at least two identical digits. I need to figure out how many such passwords are possible.Let me break this down. The total number of possible 4-digit passwords without any restrictions is 10,000 because each digit can be 0-9, so 10 options for each of the 4 digits: 10^4 = 10,000.But Petya doesn't want any 7s. So each digit can be 0-6 or 8-9. That's 9 possible digits for each position. So the total number of passwords without any 7s is 9^4. Let me calculate that: 9*9*9*9. 9*9 is 81, so 81*81 is 6561. So there are 6561 possible passwords without any 7s.Now, out of these 6561 passwords, some have all distinct digits, and some have at least two identical digits. Petya wants the ones with at least two identical digits. So maybe it's easier to calculate the total number without 7s and subtract the number of passwords with all distinct digits. That should give me the number of passwords with at least two identical digits and no 7s.So, let's compute the number of 4-digit passwords with all distinct digits and no 7s. For the first digit, we have 9 options (0-6,8-9). For the second digit, since it has to be different from the first, we have 8 options. For the third digit, it has to be different from the first two, so 7 options. For the fourth digit, it has to be different from the first three, so 6 options. So the number of such passwords is 9*8*7*6.Let me compute that: 9*8 is 72, 72*7 is 504, 504*6 is 3024. So there are 3024 passwords with all distinct digits and no 7s.Therefore, the number of passwords with at least two identical digits and no 7s is the total number without 7s minus the number with all distinct digits: 6561 - 3024.Calculating that: 6561 - 3000 is 3561, then subtract 24 more: 3561 - 24 = 3537. So is the answer 3537?Wait, let me verify my calculations again because sometimes when subtracting large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.Total without 7s: 9^4 = 6561. Correct.Number with all distinct digits: 9*8*7*6. Let me compute that again step by step.First digit: 9 options.Second digit: 8 options.Third digit: 7 options.Fourth digit: 6 options.Multiplying: 9*8 = 72.72*7 = 504.504*6 = 3024. That seems correct.So 6561 - 3024: 6561 - 3000 is 3561, then subtract 24: 3561 - 24 = 3537.Hmm, that seems correct.But wait, is there another way to compute this? Maybe using combinations with repetition or something else?Alternatively, I can think about the number of passwords with at least two identical digits as the total number without 7s minus those with all digits distinct. So yes, that's exactly what I did.Alternatively, maybe I can compute it directly by considering the different cases where there are two identical digits, three identical digits, or four identical digits.But that might be more complicated because I have to account for different cases and avoid overcounting.Let me see. For example, the number of passwords with exactly two identical digits and the other two distinct. Then the number with exactly three identical digits, and the number with all four identical digits. Then add them all up.But that might be a longer process, but let's try it to verify.First, all four digits identical: how many such passwords? Since digits can't be 7, each digit can be 0-6 or 8-9, so 9 options. So there are 9 such passwords.Next, exactly three identical digits. So, we have three of one digit and one different digit.First, choose the digit that is repeated three times: 9 options.Then, choose the different digit: it has to be different from the first digit, so 8 options.Then, choose the position where the different digit is placed. There are 4 positions, so 4 choices.So the number of such passwords is 9*8*4.Calculating that: 9*8=72, 72*4=288.Next, exactly two identical digits and the other two digits are distinct and different from the repeated digit.This is a bit more involved.First, choose the digit to be repeated: 9 options.Then, choose the two distinct digits for the other two positions: since they have to be different from each other and different from the repeated digit, so for the first of these two digits, 8 options, and for the second, 7 options. But since the order doesn't matter here, we have to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting. So the number of ways to choose the two distinct digits is (8*7)/2 = 28.Then, we need to arrange these digits in the password. We have four positions, and we need to choose two positions for the repeated digit. The number of ways to choose two positions out of four is C(4,2) = 6.So the number of such passwords is 9 * 28 * 6.Calculating that: 9*28=252, 252*6=1512.Wait, but hold on. Is that correct?Wait, actually, when choosing the two distinct digits, since they are for specific positions, the order might matter. Let me think.If I choose two distinct digits, say A and B, and assign them to specific positions, then the number of ways is 8*7, not divided by 2, because assigning A to position 1 and B to position 2 is different from assigning B to position 1 and A to position 2.Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't divide by 2.So, let's recalculate.First, choose the repeated digit: 9 options.Then, choose the first distinct digit: 8 options.Then, choose the second distinct digit: 7 options.Then, choose two positions out of four for the repeated digit: C(4,2)=6.Then, assign the two distinct digits to the remaining two positions: since the two distinct digits are different, the number of ways is 2! = 2.Therefore, the total number is 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 2.Wait, that seems too high. Let me compute that: 9*8=72, 72*7=504, 504*6=3024, 3024*2=6048. That can't be right because 6048 is larger than the total number of passwords without 7s, which is 6561.So, clearly, I made a mistake here.Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.When we have exactly two identical digits and the other two digits are distinct, the process is:1. Choose the digit to be repeated: 9 options.2. Choose the two distinct digits: since they must be different from each other and from the repeated digit, the number of ways is P(8,2) = 8*7 = 56.3. Choose the positions for the repeated digit: C(4,2)=6.4. Assign the two distinct digits to the remaining two positions: since they are distinct, the number of ways is 2! = 2.Wait, so total number is 9 * 56 * 6 * 2.Calculating that: 9*56=504, 504*6=3024, 3024*2=6048. Again, same result, which is impossible because 6048 is more than 6561.So, clearly, my approach is wrong.Wait, maybe I'm overcounting because when I choose the two distinct digits and assign them to positions, perhaps some cases are being counted multiple times.Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is:1. Choose the digit to be repeated: 9.2. Choose two positions out of four: C(4,2)=6.3. For the remaining two positions, choose two distinct digits different from the repeated digit: first digit has 8 options, second has 7 options.But since the order matters here (because the two positions are distinct), we don't need to divide by 2.So total number is 9 * 6 * 8 * 7.Calculating that: 9*6=54, 54*8=432, 432*7=3024.Wait, 3024. Hmm, that's the same number as the number of all distinct digit passwords. That can't be, because the number of passwords with exactly two identical digits should be more than the number with all distinct digits.Wait, no, actually, 3024 is the number of all distinct digit passwords. So, if I have 3024 passwords with exactly two identical digits, that would mean that the total number of passwords with at least two identical digits is 3024 (exactly two) + 288 (exactly three) + 9 (exactly four) = 3024 + 288 + 9 = 3321.But earlier, when I subtracted, I got 3537. So there's a discrepancy here.Wait, so which one is correct? Let me check.Total number of passwords without 7s: 6561.Number with all distinct digits: 3024.Thus, number with at least two identical digits: 6561 - 3024 = 3537.But when I tried to compute it directly, I got 3321, which is less. So, that suggests that my direct computation is wrong.Alternatively, maybe my direct computation is undercounting.Wait, perhaps when I computed exactly two identical digits, I considered only the case where exactly two digits are the same and the other two are different. But in reality, there could be two pairs of identical digits, like AABB or ABAB or ABBA, etc. So, in other words, the case where there are two pairs of identical digits is a separate case.So, in my previous calculation, I only considered the case where one digit is repeated twice and the other two digits are distinct and different from each other and from the repeated digit. But I didn't consider the case where there are two different digits each repeated twice.So, that's another case: two pairs of identical digits.Therefore, the total number of passwords with at least two identical digits is:- All four digits identical: 9.- Exactly three digits identical: 9*8*4=288.- Exactly two digits identical and the other two distinct: 9 * C(4,2) * 8 * 7 = 9*6*56=3024.Wait, but that still gives 9 + 288 + 3024 = 3321, which is still less than 3537.Wait, but actually, the case of two pairs is separate. So, let's compute that.Case 1: All four digits identical: 9.Case 2: Exactly three digits identical: 9*8*4=288.Case 3: Exactly two digits identical and the other two distinct: 9 * C(4,2) * 8 * 7 = 9*6*56=3024.Case 4: Two pairs of identical digits: for example, AABB, ABAB, ABBA, etc.So, how many such passwords are there?First, choose the two different digits to be paired. Since digits can't be 7, we have 9 options. We need to choose two distinct digits from these 9. The number of ways is C(9,2)=36.Then, for each pair of digits, say A and B, we need to arrange them in the four positions such that there are two As and two Bs.The number of distinct arrangements is the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 4 for digit A, and the remaining 2 positions will be digit B. The number of ways is C(4,2)=6.Therefore, the number of such passwords is C(9,2)*C(4,2)=36*6=216.So, adding this to the previous cases:Case 1: 9.Case 2: 288.Case 3: 3024.Case 4: 216.Total: 9 + 288 = 297; 297 + 3024 = 3321; 3321 + 216 = 3537.Ah, now that adds up to 3537, which matches the previous result of 6561 - 3024 = 3537.So, that makes sense. So, by considering all cases, I get the same result as subtracting the all-distinct case from the total.Therefore, the number of possible passwords is 3537.But just to make sure, let me think again.Total without 7s: 9^4=6561.Number with all digits distinct: 9*8*7*6=3024.Thus, number with at least two identical digits: 6561 - 3024=3537.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, when I broke it down into cases, I had to include the case of two pairs, which I initially missed, and that added up correctly.So, I think 3537 is the correct answer.Therefore, Petya can create such a password in 3537 different ways.**Final Answer**The number of ways Petya can create such a password is boxed{3537}."},{"question":"Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm.

What is c?textbf{(A)} -13qquadtextbf{(B)} -8qquadtextbf{(C)} 2qquadtextbf{(D)} 8qquadtextbf{(E)} 13","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about two lines being perpendicular and intersecting at a specific point, and I need to find the value of c. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, the equations given are:1. ( ax - 2y = c )2. ( 2x + by = -c )They say these lines are perpendicular and intersect at the point (1, -5). So, I need to use these two pieces of information to find c.Let me recall that two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. So, I need to find the slopes of these two lines first.Starting with the first equation: ( ax - 2y = c ). I can rewrite this in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) to find its slope.So, subtract ax from both sides: ( -2y = -ax + c ). Then, divide both sides by -2: ( y = (a/2)x - c/2 ). So, the slope (m1) of the first line is ( a/2 ).Now, the second equation: ( 2x + by = -c ). Let me do the same here. Subtract 2x from both sides: ( by = -2x - c ). Then, divide both sides by b: ( y = (-2/b)x - c/b ). So, the slope (m2) of the second line is ( -2/b ).Since the lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, ( m1 * m2 = -1 ).Plugging in the slopes: ( (a/2) * (-2/b) = -1 ).Let me compute that: ( (a/2) * (-2/b) = (-2a)/(2b) = (-a)/b ).So, ( (-a)/b = -1 ). Let me write that as an equation: ( (-a)/b = -1 ).Simplify this equation: Multiply both sides by b: ( -a = -b ). Then, multiply both sides by -1: ( a = b ).Okay, so that tells me that a and b are equal. So, a = b.Now, the lines intersect at the point (1, -5). That means when x = 1 and y = -5, both equations should be satisfied.So, let me plug x = 1 and y = -5 into both equations.First equation: ( a(1) - 2(-5) = c ). Simplify: ( a + 10 = c ). So, equation (1): ( a + 10 = c ).Second equation: ( 2(1) + b(-5) = -c ). Simplify: ( 2 - 5b = -c ). So, equation (2): ( 2 - 5b = -c ).But earlier, I found that a = b. So, I can substitute a for b in equation (2).So, equation (2) becomes: ( 2 - 5a = -c ).Now, from equation (1): ( c = a + 10 ). Let me substitute this into equation (2).So, equation (2): ( 2 - 5a = -(a + 10) ).Let me solve this equation for a.First, expand the right side: ( 2 - 5a = -a - 10 ).Now, let's bring all terms to one side. I'll add 5a to both sides: ( 2 = 4a - 10 ).Then, add 10 to both sides: ( 12 = 4a ).Divide both sides by 4: ( a = 3 ).Since a = b, then b is also 3.Now, go back to equation (1): ( c = a + 10 ). So, plug in a = 3: ( c = 3 + 10 = 13 ).Wait, so c is 13? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, slopes: m1 = a/2, m2 = -2/b. Product is -1, so (a/2)*(-2/b) = -a/b = -1. So, a = b. That seems correct.Then, plugging in (1, -5):First equation: a(1) - 2*(-5) = a + 10 = c.Second equation: 2(1) + b*(-5) = 2 - 5b = -c.Since a = b, substitute into second equation: 2 - 5a = -c. But c = a + 10, so 2 - 5a = -(a + 10).Simplify: 2 - 5a = -a - 10.Bring variables to one side: 2 + 10 = 5a - a.12 = 4a => a = 3. So, c = 3 + 10 = 13.Wait, but the options are A) -13, B) -8, C) 2, D) 8, E) 13. So, 13 is an option, E.But let me just verify with the second equation. If a = 3, b = 3, c = 13.Second equation: 2x + 3y = -13.Plug in (1, -5): 2(1) + 3(-5) = 2 - 15 = -13. Yes, that works.First equation: 3x - 2y = 13.Plug in (1, -5): 3(1) - 2(-5) = 3 + 10 = 13. That also works.So, c is indeed 13. So, the answer is E) 13.Wait, but hold on, in the problem statement, the second equation is 2x + by = -c, so plugging in (1, -5) gives 2(1) + b(-5) = -c, which is 2 - 5b = -c. So, 2 - 5b = -c. Since a = b = 3, 2 - 15 = -13, which is correct because -13 = -c => c = 13.Yes, that all checks out. So, I think E) 13 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Translate the following statements into expressions and calculate:<br/>(1) What is the sum of -9 added to the product of -4 and 5?<br/>(2) What is the result of multiplying the opposite of -6 by -2, then dividing by frac{2}{3}?","answer":"First, I need to understand what the problem is asking.

It is allowed to erase any two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) and write the number ( a + b - 1 ) instead.What number can remain on the board after 19 such operations?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where numbers 1 through 20 are written on a board. The allowed operation is to erase any two numbers, say a and b, and replace them with a + b - 1. I need to figure out what number will remain after performing this operation 19 times. Hmm, interesting.Let me start by understanding the operation better. Every time I take two numbers and replace them with their sum minus one. So, if I have numbers a and b, they become a + b - 1. That means each operation reduces the total count of numbers on the board by one. Starting with 20 numbers, after 19 operations, there should be just one number left. Got it.I wonder if there's an invariant here, something that doesn't change with each operation. Maybe the sum of all numbers or something similar? Let me check.Initially, the sum of numbers from 1 to 20 is given by the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: S = n(n + 1)/2. So, plugging in n = 20, we get S = 20*21/2 = 210. So, the initial sum is 210.Now, when I perform the operation of replacing a and b with a + b - 1, what happens to the total sum? Let's see: the new number is a + b - 1, so the sum changes by (a + b - 1) - (a + b) = -1. So, each operation decreases the total sum by 1. Since we perform this operation 19 times, the total decrease in sum will be 19*1 = 19. Therefore, the final number should be 210 - 19 = 191.Wait, is that all? Let me verify.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each operation effectively subtracting 1 from the total sum. So, starting with 210, subtract 19, which gives 191. That seems straightforward.But just to make sure, let me test this with a smaller set of numbers. Suppose I have numbers 1, 2, 3. Let's see what happens.First, sum is 6. Let's perform the operation twice to get down to one number.First operation: erase 1 and 2, replace with 1 + 2 - 1 = 2. Now, numbers are 2 and 3. Sum is 5, which is 6 - 1 = 5. Correct.Second operation: erase 2 and 3, replace with 2 + 3 - 1 = 4. Sum is 4, which is 5 - 1 = 4. So, the final number is 4, which is indeed 6 - 2 = 4. That works.Another test case: numbers 1, 2. Sum is 3. One operation: replace 1 and 2 with 1 + 2 - 1 = 2. Sum is 2, which is 3 - 1 = 2. Correct.So, it seems that the invariant is indeed the total sum decreasing by 1 each time. Therefore, for the original problem, the final number should be 210 - 19 = 191.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Suppose instead of tracking the sum, I track something else. For example, maybe the product or another function. But in this case, the operation is linear, so the sum is the natural candidate for an invariant.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a binary tree where each combination of two numbers is a node, and the final number is the root. But that might complicate things. The sum approach seems straightforward.Alternatively, think recursively. Suppose I have n numbers, and each operation reduces the count by 1, so after n - 1 operations, I have one number. The total decrease in sum is n - 1. So, the final number is the initial sum minus (n - 1). For n = 20, initial sum is 210, so 210 - 19 = 191. Yep, that seems consistent.Wait, another thought: is there a different invariant? For example, maybe the sum modulo something? But since each operation subtracts 1, the total sum modulo any number would change predictably, but since we're just asked for the final number, the total sum minus 19 is sufficient.Alternatively, maybe I can think of the process as building a binary tree where each combination is a node, and the value at each node is a + b - 1. Then, the final value would be the sum of all the original numbers minus the number of operations, which is 19. So, again, 210 - 19 = 191.Wait, but let me try another small example to make sure. Let's take numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Sum is 10. Let's perform 3 operations.First operation: combine 1 and 2 to get 2. Numbers: 2, 3, 4. Sum: 9.Second operation: combine 2 and 3 to get 4. Numbers: 4, 4. Sum: 8.Third operation: combine 4 and 4 to get 7. Sum: 7. Which is 10 - 3 = 7. Correct.Alternatively, another sequence: first combine 3 and 4 to get 6. Numbers: 1, 2, 6. Sum: 9.Then combine 1 and 2 to get 2. Numbers: 2, 6. Sum: 8.Then combine 2 and 6 to get 7. Sum: 7. Same result.So, regardless of the order, the final number is the initial sum minus the number of operations. Therefore, for 20 numbers, it's 210 - 19 = 191.I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 191."},{"question":"The length of a rectangle is three times its width. If the length is decreased by 5 and the width is increased by 5, the rectangle becomes a square.

The equations given are:First circle: ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 8 = 0 )Second circle: ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 3x + 4y - 18 = 0 )Hmm, I remember that the common chord of two circles is the line segment where the two circles intersect. To find its length, I think I need to find the points where the two circles intersect and then calculate the distance between those two points. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates the distance between the centers and the radii to the length of the common chord.Let me recall. I think the formula for the length of the common chord is ( 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} ), where ( r ) is the radius of one of the circles and ( d ) is the distance from the center of that circle to the common chord. But wait, that might be the formula for the length of the chord at a certain distance from the center. Maybe I need to adjust it for two circles.Alternatively, I remember that if two circles intersect, the line connecting their centers is perpendicular to the common chord and bisects it. So, if I can find the distance between the centers and the radii of both circles, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find half the length of the common chord.Let me try this approach.First, let me write down the equations of both circles in standard form.Starting with the first circle: ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 8 = 0 )This can be rewritten as ( x^2 + y^2 = 8 ). So, the center is at (0, 0) and the radius is ( sqrt{8} ) or ( 2sqrt{2} ).Now, the second circle: ( x^{2} + y^{2} - 3x + 4y - 18 = 0 )I need to complete the squares for x and y to get it into standard form.Let me rearrange the equation:( x^2 - 3x + y^2 + 4y = 18 )Now, completing the square for x:Take the coefficient of x, which is -3, divide by 2 to get -3/2, square it to get 9/4.Similarly, for y:Coefficient of y is 4, divide by 2 to get 2, square it to get 4.So, adding these squares to both sides:( (x^2 - 3x + 9/4) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) = 18 + 9/4 + 4 )Simplify:( (x - 3/2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 18 + 9/4 + 4 )Calculating the right side:18 is 72/4, 9/4 is 9/4, and 4 is 16/4. So, adding them together:72/4 + 9/4 + 16/4 = (72 + 9 + 16)/4 = 97/4.So, the equation becomes:( (x - 3/2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 97/4 )Therefore, the center of the second circle is at (3/2, -2) and the radius is ( sqrt{97/4} ) or ( sqrt{97}/2 ).Okay, so now I have both circles in standard form:Circle 1: Center (0, 0), radius ( 2sqrt{2} ).Circle 2: Center (3/2, -2), radius ( sqrt{97}/2 ).Next, I need to find the distance between the centers of the two circles. Let me denote the centers as C1 (0,0) and C2 (3/2, -2).The distance between C1 and C2 can be found using the distance formula:( d = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} )Plugging in the coordinates:( d = sqrt{(3/2 - 0)^2 + (-2 - 0)^2} = sqrt{(9/4) + 4} = sqrt{9/4 + 16/4} = sqrt{25/4} = 5/2 ).So, the distance between the centers is 5/2.Now, I need to find the length of the common chord. As I thought earlier, the line connecting the centers is perpendicular to the common chord and bisects it. So, if I can find the length from the center of one circle to the common chord, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find half the length of the chord.Let me denote the length of the common chord as L. Then, half of that is L/2.Let me consider the triangle formed by the center of the first circle (C1), the midpoint of the common chord (let's call it M), and one of the intersection points (let's say P). This triangle is a right-angled triangle with sides:- C1M: distance from center to the chord (let's denote this as h)- MP: half the length of the chord (L/2)- C1P: radius of the first circle (2√2)Similarly, for the second circle, the triangle C2M P is also right-angled with sides:- C2M: distance from center to the chord (let's denote this as h')- MP: L/2- C2P: radius of the second circle (√97 / 2)But since both triangles share the same MP, which is L/2, and the distance between C1 and C2 is 5/2, which is equal to h + h' (since the line connecting centers is perpendicular to the chord and the midpoint M lies on this line). Wait, actually, is it h + h' or |h - h'|?Wait, no. Since both centers are on opposite sides of the chord, the distance between the centers is actually the sum of the distances from each center to the chord. So, h + h' = 5/2.But also, from the right triangles, we have:For circle 1:( h^2 + (L/2)^2 = (2sqrt{2})^2 )Which simplifies to:( h^2 + (L/2)^2 = 8 )Similarly, for circle 2:( (h')^2 + (L/2)^2 = (sqrt{97}/2)^2 )Which simplifies to:( (h')^2 + (L/2)^2 = 97/4 )So, now we have two equations:1. ( h + h' = 5/2 )2. ( h^2 + (L/2)^2 = 8 )3. ( (h')^2 + (L/2)^2 = 97/4 )Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 3 to eliminate (L/2)^2:( (h')^2 - h^2 = 97/4 - 8 )Calculating the right side:97/4 - 8 = 97/4 - 32/4 = 65/4So, ( (h')^2 - h^2 = 65/4 )But ( (h')^2 - h^2 = (h' - h)(h' + h) )We know that h + h' = 5/2, so:( (h' - h)(5/2) = 65/4 )Therefore, ( h' - h = (65/4) / (5/2) = (65/4) * (2/5) = (65*2)/(4*5) = 130/20 = 13/2 )So, now we have:h + h' = 5/2h' - h = 13/2Let me solve these two equations for h and h'.Adding the two equations:(h + h') + (h' - h) = 5/2 + 13/2Simplifies to:2h' = 18/2 = 9So, h' = 9/2Then, plugging back into h + h' = 5/2:h + 9/2 = 5/2So, h = 5/2 - 9/2 = (-4)/2 = -2Wait, h is negative? That doesn't make sense because distance can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.Wait, let's think about this. The distance from the center to the chord can't be negative, so perhaps I messed up the direction when subtracting. Maybe h' - h should be negative?Wait, let me double-check.We had:( (h')^2 - h^2 = 65/4 )And we factored it as (h' - h)(h' + h) = 65/4We know h + h' = 5/2, so:(h' - h)(5/2) = 65/4Therefore, h' - h = (65/4) / (5/2) = (65/4)*(2/5) = 130/20 = 13/2So, h' - h = 13/2But h + h' = 5/2So, adding these two equations:2h' = 5/2 + 13/2 = 18/2 = 9So, h' = 9/2Then, h = 5/2 - h' = 5/2 - 9/2 = (-4)/2 = -2Hmm, negative value for h. That doesn't make sense because distance can't be negative.Wait, perhaps I have the direction wrong. Maybe h is the distance from C1 to the chord, and h' is the distance from C2 to the chord, but if the chord is closer to C1, then h' would be larger. But in this case, h' is 9/2, which is 4.5, but the distance between centers is only 5/2, which is 2.5. So, h' can't be 4.5 because that's larger than the distance between centers.So, that must mean I made a mistake in my approach.Wait, perhaps I should not assume that h + h' = 5/2. Maybe it's the absolute difference? Because depending on the position, the distances could be on the same side or opposite sides.Wait, actually, the common chord is the line where both circles intersect, so the line connecting the centers is perpendicular to the chord and passes through the midpoint. Therefore, the distances from each center to the chord are on the same line but in opposite directions. So, the distance between the centers is equal to the sum of the distances from each center to the chord.But in this case, h and h' are in opposite directions, so h + h' = distance between centers, which is 5/2.But if h is negative, that would imply that the direction is opposite, but distance is always positive. Maybe I need to take absolute values.Wait, perhaps I should consider h and h' as lengths, so they are positive. Therefore, h + h' = 5/2.But then, in the equation h' - h = 13/2, if h' is larger than h by 13/2, but h + h' = 5/2, that would mean h' = 5/2 + h, but h' - h = 13/2, so substituting h' = 5/2 + h into h' - h = 13/2:(5/2 + h) - h = 13/2Simplifies to 5/2 = 13/2, which is not true. So, that can't be.Hmm, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should use another method.Wait, another way to find the length of the common chord is to find the points of intersection and then compute the distance between them.So, maybe I can solve the two equations simultaneously to find the points of intersection.Let me try that.We have:1. ( x^2 + y^2 = 8 ) (Equation 1)2. ( x^2 + y^2 - 3x + 4y - 18 = 0 ) (Equation 2)Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate ( x^2 + y^2 ):( (x^2 + y^2 - 3x + 4y - 18) - (x^2 + y^2 - 8) = 0 )Simplify:( -3x + 4y - 18 + 8 = 0 )Which becomes:( -3x + 4y - 10 = 0 )So, ( -3x + 4y = 10 ) or ( 3x - 4y = -10 )This is the equation of the common chord.Now, to find the points of intersection, I can solve this equation along with Equation 1.Let me express x in terms of y from the chord equation.From ( 3x - 4y = -10 ):( 3x = 4y - 10 )( x = (4y - 10)/3 )Now, plug this into Equation 1:( [(4y - 10)/3]^2 + y^2 = 8 )Let me compute this step by step.First, square ( (4y - 10)/3 ):( [(4y - 10)/3]^2 = (16y^2 - 80y + 100)/9 )So, plugging back into Equation 1:( (16y^2 - 80y + 100)/9 + y^2 = 8 )Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the denominator:( 16y^2 - 80y + 100 + 9y^2 = 72 )Combine like terms:( (16y^2 + 9y^2) + (-80y) + (100 - 72) = 0 )Simplify:( 25y^2 - 80y + 28 = 0 )So, we have a quadratic equation in y:( 25y^2 - 80y + 28 = 0 )Let me try to solve this quadratic.Using the quadratic formula:( y = [80 pm sqrt{(-80)^2 - 4*25*28}]/(2*25) )Calculate discriminant:( D = 6400 - 2800 = 3600 )So, sqrt(D) = 60Therefore,( y = [80 pm 60]/50 )Calculating the two solutions:First solution:( y = (80 + 60)/50 = 140/50 = 2.8 ) or ( 14/5 )Second solution:( y = (80 - 60)/50 = 20/50 = 0.4 ) or ( 2/5 )So, the y-coordinates of the intersection points are 14/5 and 2/5.Now, let's find the corresponding x-coordinates using ( x = (4y - 10)/3 )First, for y = 14/5:( x = (4*(14/5) - 10)/3 = (56/5 - 50/5)/3 = (6/5)/3 = (6/5)*(1/3) = 2/5 )So, one point is (2/5, 14/5)Second, for y = 2/5:( x = (4*(2/5) - 10)/3 = (8/5 - 50/5)/3 = (-42/5)/3 = (-42/5)*(1/3) = -14/5 )So, the other point is (-14/5, 2/5)Therefore, the two points of intersection are (2/5, 14/5) and (-14/5, 2/5)Now, to find the length of the common chord, I need to compute the distance between these two points.Using the distance formula:( L = sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} )Plugging in the coordinates:( L = sqrt{(-14/5 - 2/5)^2 + (2/5 - 14/5)^2} )Simplify the differences:For x: (-14/5 - 2/5) = (-16/5)For y: (2/5 - 14/5) = (-12/5)So,( L = sqrt{(-16/5)^2 + (-12/5)^2} = sqrt{(256/25) + (144/25)} = sqrt{400/25} = sqrt{16} = 4 )So, the length of the common chord is 4.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify my calculations because earlier I had some confusion with h and h' giving a negative value, but this method gave me a clear answer.Alternatively, let me see if I can get the same result using the other method.We had:From the first circle:( h^2 + (L/2)^2 = 8 )From the second circle:( (h')^2 + (L/2)^2 = 97/4 )And h + h' = 5/2But earlier, solving gave h = -2 and h' = 9/2, which didn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign.Wait, perhaps h is the distance from C1 to the chord, and h' is the distance from C2 to the chord, but since the chord is closer to C1, h is less than h', but h' - h = 13/2 is larger than the distance between centers, which is 5/2, so that can't be.Alternatively, maybe I should have taken h' - h = -13/2, but that would mean h - h' = 13/2, which would lead to h = h' + 13/2, and then h + h' = 5/2, so h' + 13/2 + h' = 5/2 => 2h' +13/2 =5/2 => 2h' =5/2 -13/2= -8/2= -4 => h'= -2, which is also negative.Hmm, so both approaches give negative distances, which is impossible. So, perhaps my initial assumption that h + h' =5/2 is incorrect.Wait, maybe h and h' are vectors in opposite directions, so the distance between centers is |h - h'|. Let me think.If the chord is between the two centers, then the distance from C1 to the chord is h, and from C2 to the chord is h', but since they are on opposite sides, the distance between centers is h + h'.But if the chord is on the same side of both centers, then the distance between centers is |h - h'|.Wait, but in reality, the common chord is such that the centers are on opposite sides of the chord, so the distance between centers is h + h'.But in this case, h + h' =5/2, but when solving, we get h' - h=13/2, which is larger than 5/2, which is impossible because h' - h can't be larger than h + h'.Wait, that suggests that perhaps the chord is not between the two centers, but rather, one center is on one side of the chord, and the other center is on the same side, which would mean that the distance between centers is |h - h'|.But in that case, if h > h', then h - h' =5/2.But in our earlier equations, we had:h + h' =5/2andh' - h=13/2Which is inconsistent because h' - h=13/2 would imply h' = h +13/2, so plugging into h + h' =5/2:h + (h +13/2)=5/2 => 2h +13/2=5/2 => 2h=5/2 -13/2= (-8)/2= -4 => h= -2Again, negative.Alternatively, if the distance between centers is |h - h'|, then:|h - h'|=5/2But we also have:h^2 + (L/2)^2=8(h')^2 + (L/2)^2=97/4And |h - h'|=5/2So, let's suppose h > h', then h - h'=5/2So, h = h' +5/2Plugging into the first equation:(h')^2 + (L/2)^2=97/4And into the second equation:(h' +5/2)^2 + (L/2)^2=8Subtract the second equation from the first:(h')^2 + (L/2)^2 - [(h' +5/2)^2 + (L/2)^2] =97/4 -8Simplify:(h')^2 - (h' +5/2)^2 =97/4 -32/4=65/4Expanding (h' +5/2)^2:= h'^2 +5h' +25/4So,(h')^2 - (h'^2 +5h' +25/4)=65/4Simplify:-5h' -25/4=65/4Multiply both sides by 4:-20h' -25=65So,-20h' =65 +25=90Thus,h'=90/(-20)= -9/2Again, negative. Hmm, that's not possible.Wait, maybe h' > h, so h' - h=5/2Then, h'=h +5/2Plugging into the first equation:h^2 + (L/2)^2=8Second equation:(h +5/2)^2 + (L/2)^2=97/4Subtract first equation from the second:(h +5/2)^2 - h^2=97/4 -8=65/4Expanding (h +5/2)^2:h^2 +5h +25/4So,h^2 +5h +25/4 -h^2=65/4Simplify:5h +25/4=65/4Subtract 25/4:5h=65/4 -25/4=40/4=10Thus,h=10/5=2So, h=2Then, h'=h +5/2=2 +2.5=4.5=9/2So, h=2, h'=9/2Now, plug h=2 into the first equation:2^2 + (L/2)^2=84 + (L/2)^2=8(L/2)^2=4So, L/2=2Thus, L=4Which matches the result I got earlier by solving for the points of intersection.So, the length of the common chord is 4.Therefore, despite the confusion with the distances h and h', the correct length is 4.**Final Answer**The length of the common chord is boxed{4}."},{"question":"How many three-digit numbers are there in which the digits 1, 2, and 3 each appear exactly once?","answer":"First, I recognize that a three-digit number has three positions: the hundreds place, the tens place, and the units place.Since each of the digits 1, 2, and 3 must appear exactly once, I need to determine how many different ways these three digits can be arranged in the three positions.This is a permutation problem where I'm arranging all three digits without repetition.The number of permutations of three distinct digits is calculated using the factorial of the number of digits, which is 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6.Therefore, there are 6 different three-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, and 3 exactly once."},{"question":"Calculate: (-frac{1}{3})^{-2}+(1-sqrt{2})^{0}-2cos 60^{circ}=______.","answer":"First, I need to evaluate each term in the expression separately.For the first term, ((- frac{1}{3})^{-2}), I can rewrite the negative exponent as a positive exponent by taking the reciprocal.

What fraction of the area of triangle ABC does the area of triangle KEM occupy if BM:ME = 2:3?","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about an isosceles triangle ABC with base AC. Points E, K, and M are taken on the base and sides such that KE is parallel to BC and EM is parallel to AB. The ratio of BM to ME is given as 2:3, and I need to find what fraction of the area of triangle ABC is occupied by triangle KEM.First, let me try to visualize the triangle. Since ABC is isosceles with base AC, that means sides AB and BC are equal in length. So, vertex B is opposite the base AC, and AB = BC. That makes sense.Now, point E is on base AC. Points K and M are on sides AB and BC respectively. The lines KE and EM are parallel to BC and AB, respectively. Hmm, okay. So, KE is parallel to BC, which is one of the equal sides, and EM is parallel to AB, which is the other equal side.Since KE is parallel to BC, triangle AKE must be similar to triangle ABC because of the parallel sides. Similarly, since EM is parallel to AB, triangle EMC must also be similar to triangle ABC. That seems right because when a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it creates a smaller similar triangle.Given that BM:ME = 2:3, I need to relate this ratio to the areas. Maybe I can find the lengths of BM and ME in terms of the sides of the triangle, and then use that to find the areas.Let me assign some variables to make this easier. Let’s denote the length of AB and BC as 's' since it's an isosceles triangle. The base AC can be considered as another length, say 'b'. But since the triangle is isosceles, the height from B to AC will bisect AC. Let me denote the height as 'h'.But maybe instead of dealing with lengths, I can use coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle ABC on a coordinate system. Let’s put point A at (0, 0), point C at (c, 0), so the base AC is along the x-axis. Since it's an isosceles triangle with base AC, point B will be at (c/2, h), where h is the height.So, coordinates:- A: (0, 0)- C: (c, 0)- B: (c/2, h)Now, point E is on AC. Let me denote the coordinates of E as (e, 0), where e is between 0 and c.Point K is on AB, and point M is on BC. Since KE is parallel to BC, which has a slope of (h - 0)/(c/2 - c) = (h)/(-c/2) = -2h/c. So, the slope of BC is -2h/c. Therefore, KE must also have the same slope.Similarly, EM is parallel to AB. The slope of AB is (h - 0)/(c/2 - 0) = 2h/c. So, EM must have the same slope.Let me find the coordinates of K and M.First, let's find K. Since K is on AB, which goes from (0,0) to (c/2, h). Let me parametrize AB. Let’s say K divides AB in the ratio t:(1-t), so its coordinates would be ( (c/2)*t, h*t ). Similarly, since KE is parallel to BC, the line from K to E must have the same slope as BC, which is -2h/c.So, the slope of KE is (0 - h*t)/(e - (c/2)*t) = (-h*t)/(e - (c/2)*t) = -2h/c.So, setting up the equation:(-h*t)/(e - (c/2)*t) = -2h/cSimplify:(h*t)/(e - (c/2)*t) = 2h/cCancel h from both sides:t/(e - (c/2)*t) = 2/cCross-multiplying:t = 2/c * (e - (c/2)*t)Multiply out the right side:t = (2e)/c - (2/c)*(c/2)*tt = (2e)/c - tBring t to the left side:t + t = (2e)/c2t = (2e)/ct = e/cSo, t is e/c. Therefore, the coordinates of K are ( (c/2)*(e/c), h*(e/c) ) = (e/2, (h e)/c )Okay, so K is at (e/2, (h e)/c )Now, let's find M. Since EM is parallel to AB, which has a slope of 2h/c. So, the slope of EM is also 2h/c.Point E is at (e, 0), and point M is on BC. Let me parametrize BC. BC goes from (c/2, h) to (c, 0). Let me use a parameter s such that M divides BC in the ratio s:(1-s). So, coordinates of M would be ( (c/2)*(1 - s) + c*s, h*(1 - s) + 0*s ) = (c/2 + (c/2)s, h - h s )So, M is at ( c/2 + (c/2)s, h - h s )Now, the slope of EM is ( (h - h s) - 0 ) / ( c/2 + (c/2)s - e ) = (h(1 - s)) / ( c/2(1 + s) - e )This slope must equal 2h/c.So,(h(1 - s)) / ( c/2(1 + s) - e ) = 2h/cCancel h:(1 - s) / ( c/2(1 + s) - e ) = 2/cMultiply both sides by denominator:1 - s = 2/c * ( c/2(1 + s) - e )Simplify the right side:2/c * ( c/2(1 + s) - e ) = (2/c)*(c/2)(1 + s) - (2/c)*e = (1 + s) - (2e)/cSo,1 - s = (1 + s) - (2e)/cBring all terms to left:1 - s -1 - s + (2e)/c = 0Simplify:-2s + (2e)/c = 0So,-2s + (2e)/c = 0Divide both sides by 2:-s + e/c = 0 => s = e/cSo, s = e/c. Therefore, the coordinates of M are:( c/2 + (c/2)*(e/c), h - h*(e/c) ) = ( c/2 + e/2, h - (h e)/c ) = ( (c + e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )So, M is at ( (c + e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )Now, we have coordinates for K, E, and M.K: (e/2, (h e)/c )E: (e, 0 )M: ( (c + e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )Now, we need to find the area of triangle KEM.To find the area, I can use the shoelace formula.First, let me write down the coordinates:K: (e/2, (h e)/c )E: (e, 0 )M: ( (c + e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )So, let's list them in order:K: (e/2, (h e)/c )E: (e, 0 )M: ( (c + e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )Back to K: (e/2, (h e)/c )Compute the shoelace sum:Sum1 = (e/2)*0 + e*h(1 - e/c ) + ( (c + e)/2 )*(h e)/cSum2 = (h e)/c * e + 0*( (c + e)/2 ) + h(1 - e/c )*(e/2 )Area = |Sum1 - Sum2| / 2Let me compute Sum1:First term: (e/2)*0 = 0Second term: e * h(1 - e/c ) = e h - (e^2 h)/cThird term: ( (c + e)/2 ) * (h e)/c = ( (c + e) h e ) / (2c ) = (c h e + e^2 h ) / (2c )So, Sum1 = 0 + e h - (e^2 h)/c + (c h e + e^2 h ) / (2c )Simplify:Sum1 = e h - (e^2 h)/c + (c h e)/(2c ) + (e^2 h)/(2c )Simplify each term:= e h - (e^2 h)/c + (h e)/2 + (e^2 h)/(2c )Combine like terms:e h + (h e)/2 = (3/2) e h- (e^2 h)/c + (e^2 h)/(2c ) = - (e^2 h)/(2c )So, Sum1 = (3/2) e h - (e^2 h)/(2c )Now, compute Sum2:First term: (h e)/c * e = (h e^2)/cSecond term: 0 * ( (c + e)/2 ) = 0Third term: h(1 - e/c ) * (e/2 ) = (h e / 2 ) - (h e^2 )/(2c )So, Sum2 = (h e^2)/c + 0 + (h e / 2 ) - (h e^2 )/(2c )Simplify:= (h e^2)/c - (h e^2 )/(2c ) + (h e)/2= (2 h e^2 - h e^2 )/(2c ) + (h e)/2= (h e^2 )/(2c ) + (h e)/2So, Sum2 = (h e^2 )/(2c ) + (h e)/2Now, compute Sum1 - Sum2:Sum1 - Sum2 = [ (3/2) e h - (e^2 h)/(2c ) ] - [ (h e^2 )/(2c ) + (h e)/2 ]= (3/2 e h - (e^2 h)/(2c )) - (h e^2 )/(2c ) - (h e)/2= (3/2 e h - (h e)/2 ) - (e^2 h)/(2c ) - (e^2 h)/(2c )= ( (3/2 - 1/2 ) e h ) - ( (1/2 + 1/2 ) e^2 h / c )= ( e h ) - ( e^2 h / c )So, Sum1 - Sum2 = e h - ( e^2 h ) / cTherefore, the area of triangle KEM is | e h - ( e^2 h ) / c | / 2Since all terms are positive (lengths and height are positive), we can drop the absolute value:Area = ( e h - ( e^2 h ) / c ) / 2 = ( e h (1 - e / c ) ) / 2So, Area of KEM = ( e h (1 - e / c ) ) / 2Now, let's find the area of triangle ABC.Area of ABC is (base * height)/2 = (c * h)/2So, Area ABC = (c h)/2We need the ratio of Area KEM to Area ABC.Ratio = [ ( e h (1 - e / c ) ) / 2 ] / [ (c h ) / 2 ] = [ e (1 - e / c ) ] / c = [ e ( (c - e ) / c ) ] / c = ( e (c - e ) ) / c^2So, Ratio = ( e (c - e ) ) / c^2Hmm, so the ratio depends on e. But we need to find e in terms of the given ratio BM:ME = 2:3.Wait, earlier, we found that s = e/c, where s is the parameter for point M on BC.But s = e/c, and s is the ratio BM:BC? Wait, no, s is the parameter such that M divides BC in the ratio s:(1 - s). Wait, actually, in our parametrization, s was the fraction from B to C. So, if s = e/c, then BM = s * BC.But BC has length sqrt( (c/2)^2 + h^2 ). Wait, but maybe it's better to express BM and ME in terms of coordinates.Wait, point M is on BC, and BM:ME = 2:3.Wait, hold on, BM:ME = 2:3. So, BM is part of BC, but ME is part of EM. Wait, no, EM is a segment from E to M. So, BM is a segment on BC, and ME is a segment on EM.Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the ratio.Wait, the problem says BM:ME = 2:3. So, the length of BM is to the length of ME as 2 is to 3.So, BM / ME = 2 / 3.So, BM = (2/3) ME.But BM is along BC, and ME is along EM.Wait, but EM is parallel to AB, so triangle EMC is similar to triangle ABC.Wait, earlier, we found that M is at ( (c + e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )So, the length of ME can be calculated.Wait, point M is at ( (c + e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )Point E is at (e, 0 )So, vector ME is from E to M: ( (c + e)/2 - e, h(1 - e/c ) - 0 ) = ( (c - e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )So, the length of ME is sqrt( [ (c - e)/2 ]^2 + [ h(1 - e/c ) ]^2 )Similarly, BM is the length from B to M.Point B is at (c/2, h )Point M is at ( (c + e)/2, h(1 - e/c ) )So, vector BM is ( (c + e)/2 - c/2, h(1 - e/c ) - h ) = ( e/2, - h e / c )So, length of BM is sqrt( (e/2)^2 + ( - h e / c )^2 ) = sqrt( e^2 / 4 + ( h^2 e^2 ) / c^2 )So, BM / ME = 2 / 3So,sqrt( e^2 / 4 + ( h^2 e^2 ) / c^2 ) / sqrt( [ (c - e)^2 / 4 + h^2 (1 - e/c )^2 ] ) = 2 / 3This seems complicated, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.So,[ e^2 / 4 + ( h^2 e^2 ) / c^2 ] / [ (c - e)^2 / 4 + h^2 (1 - e/c )^2 ] = 4 / 9Let me compute numerator and denominator.Numerator:e^2 / 4 + ( h^2 e^2 ) / c^2 = e^2 ( 1/4 + h^2 / c^2 )Denominator:(c - e)^2 / 4 + h^2 (1 - e/c )^2Let me factor out (1 - e/c )^2 from the denominator:= [ (c - e)^2 / 4 + h^2 (1 - e/c )^2 ] = (1 - e/c )^2 [ (c^2 ) / 4 + h^2 ]Wait, let me check:(c - e)^2 = c^2 - 2 c e + e^2(1 - e/c )^2 = 1 - 2 e/c + e^2 / c^2So, (c - e)^2 / 4 = (c^2 - 2 c e + e^2 ) / 4h^2 (1 - e/c )^2 = h^2 (1 - 2 e/c + e^2 / c^2 )So, adding them together:(c^2 - 2 c e + e^2 ) / 4 + h^2 (1 - 2 e/c + e^2 / c^2 )Hmm, not sure if that's factorable. Maybe let me compute it as is.Let me denote t = e/c, so e = t c, where t is between 0 and 1.So, substituting e = t c:Numerator:e^2 ( 1/4 + h^2 / c^2 ) = t^2 c^2 ( 1/4 + h^2 / c^2 ) = t^2 ( c^2 / 4 + h^2 )Denominator:(c - e)^2 / 4 + h^2 (1 - e/c )^2 = (c - t c )^2 / 4 + h^2 (1 - t )^2 = c^2 (1 - t )^2 / 4 + h^2 (1 - t )^2 = (1 - t )^2 ( c^2 / 4 + h^2 )So, the ratio becomes:Numerator / Denominator = [ t^2 ( c^2 / 4 + h^2 ) ] / [ (1 - t )^2 ( c^2 / 4 + h^2 ) ] = t^2 / (1 - t )^2So, the ratio is t^2 / (1 - t )^2 = 4 / 9Therefore,t^2 / (1 - t )^2 = 4 / 9Take square roots:t / (1 - t ) = 2 / 3So,3 t = 2 (1 - t )3 t = 2 - 2 t3 t + 2 t = 25 t = 2t = 2 / 5So, t = e / c = 2 / 5Therefore, e = (2 / 5 ) cSo, e is 2/5 of c.Now, going back to the ratio of areas.Earlier, we had:Ratio = ( e (c - e ) ) / c^2Substituting e = (2/5)c:Ratio = ( (2/5)c ( c - (2/5)c ) ) / c^2 = ( (2/5)c ( (3/5)c ) ) / c^2 = ( (6/25)c^2 ) / c^2 = 6/25So, the area of triangle KEM is 6/25 of the area of triangle ABC.Therefore, the fraction is 6/25.**Final Answer**The area of triangle KEM occupies boxed{dfrac{6}{25}} of the area of triangle ABC."},{"question":"David has a store where he sells cell phones.

Then he notices that he has 5 iPhones and in the initial inventory, but started with 8. His staff then told him that in the afternoon they realized that 2 Samsung cell phones were damaged and 1 iPhone had a manufacturing defect in the screen, so they threw these out during the day. What was the total number of cell phones that were sold today?","answer":"First, I'll determine the number of Samsung cell phones sold by subtracting the ending inventory from the beginning inventory. David started with 14 Samsung phones and ended with 10, so 14 minus 10 equals 4 Samsung phones sold.Next, I'll calculate the number of iPhones sold. He began with 8 iPhones and ended with 5, so 8 minus 5 equals 3 iPhones sold.Additionally, the staff mentioned that 2 Samsung phones were damaged and 1 iPhone had a manufacturing defect, which were discarded during the day. These discarded phones should also be considered as part of the total phones no longer in inventory.Finally, I'll add up all the phones that were either sold or discarded to find the total number of cell phones that were sold today.

The sum of these three integers is 12 and their product is 30. What is the age of each of his three children?","answer":"First, I need to determine the ages of Paulo's three children.

They are defined as:A = √5 + √(22 + 2√5)andB = √(11 + 2√29) + √(16 - 2√29 + 2√(55 - 10√29))Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify each part step by step. Let me start with A.First, A is √5 plus another square root. The second term is √(22 + 2√5). I wonder if that can be simplified. Sometimes expressions under a square root can be expressed as (√a + √b)^2, which would make it easier to take the square root.Let me try to express 22 + 2√5 as (√a + √b)^2. Expanding that, we get a + b + 2√(ab). So, we need:a + b = 22and2√(ab) = 2√5Dividing both sides of the second equation by 2, we get √(ab) = √5, so ab = 5.Now, we have a system of equations:a + b = 22ab = 5Hmm, that seems tricky because 22 is quite large compared to 5. Let me see if I can find integers a and b that satisfy this. Wait, maybe they aren't integers. Let me try to solve for a and b.From the first equation, b = 22 - a. Substitute into the second equation:a(22 - a) = 522a - a² = 5Rearranging:a² - 22a + 5 = 0Using the quadratic formula, a = [22 ± √(484 - 20)] / 2 = [22 ± √464]/2√464 is √(16*29) = 4√29, so a = [22 ± 4√29]/2 = 11 ± 2√29So, a and b are 11 + 2√29 and 11 - 2√29. Therefore, 22 + 2√5 can be written as (√(11 + 2√29) + √(11 - 2√29))².Wait, let me check that:(√(11 + 2√29) + √(11 - 2√29))² = (11 + 2√29) + (11 - 2√29) + 2√{(11 + 2√29)(11 - 2√29)}Simplify:= 22 + 2√{(11)^2 - (2√29)^2} = 22 + 2√{121 - 4*29} = 22 + 2√{121 - 116} = 22 + 2√5Yes, that works! So, √(22 + 2√5) = √(11 + 2√29) + √(11 - 2√29)Therefore, A = √5 + √(22 + 2√5) = √5 + √(11 + 2√29) + √(11 - 2√29)Wait, but looking at B, it's √(11 + 2√29) + something else. Let me write down B again:B = √(11 + 2√29) + √(16 - 2√29 + 2√(55 - 10√29))So, B has the same first term as A, which is √(11 + 2√29). So, A has that term plus √5 and √(11 - 2√29), while B has that term plus another square root.So, maybe if I can express the second term in B in a similar way, I can compare A and B.Let me look at the second term in B: √(16 - 2√29 + 2√(55 - 10√29))Hmm, that's a bit complex. Maybe I can simplify the inner square root first: √(55 - 10√29). Let me see if that can be expressed as √c - √d or something.Let me assume √(55 - 10√29) = √c - √d. Then, squaring both sides:55 - 10√29 = c + d - 2√(cd)So, we have:c + d = 55and-2√(cd) = -10√29Divide both sides by -2: √(cd) = 5√29, so cd = 25*29 = 725So, we have c + d = 55 and c*d = 725Let me solve for c and d.From c + d = 55, so d = 55 - c.Substitute into c*d = 725:c*(55 - c) = 72555c - c² = 725Rearranged: c² - 55c + 725 = 0Quadratic equation: c = [55 ± √(3025 - 2900)] / 2 = [55 ± √125]/2 = [55 ± 5√5]/2Hmm, that's not nice. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe it's √c + √d instead?Wait, but 55 - 10√29 is less than 55, so if I take √c - √d, it could be positive or negative. But since square roots are positive, maybe √c - √d is positive, so c > d.Wait, maybe I can try another approach. Let me compute 55 - 10√29 numerically to see if it's a perfect square or something.Compute √29 ≈ 5.385So, 10√29 ≈ 53.85Thus, 55 - 53.85 ≈ 1.15So, √(1.15) ≈ 1.072Hmm, that's approximately 1.072, which doesn't seem like a nice number. Maybe it's not a perfect square. So perhaps my initial approach isn't working.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression under the square root in B's second term is a square of something.Let me denote the second term as √(16 - 2√29 + 2√(55 - 10√29)). Let me call this term C.So, C = √(16 - 2√29 + 2√(55 - 10√29))Is there a way to write 16 - 2√29 + 2√(55 - 10√29) as a square?Maybe something like (√a + √b)^2, but let's see.Alternatively, maybe it's (√x + √y - √z)^2 or something more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as (√m + √n)^2, where m and n are expressions involving √29.Wait, let me try:Let me assume that 16 - 2√29 + 2√(55 - 10√29) = (√a + √b)^2Expanding the right side: a + b + 2√(ab)So, equate:a + b = 16 - 2√29and2√(ab) = 2√(55 - 10√29)Simplify:√(ab) = √(55 - 10√29) => ab = 55 - 10√29So, we have:a + b = 16 - 2√29ab = 55 - 10√29Hmm, so we need to find a and b such that their sum is 16 - 2√29 and their product is 55 - 10√29.This seems similar to solving a quadratic equation where a and b are roots.Let me set up the quadratic equation: x² - (a + b)x + ab = 0 => x² - (16 - 2√29)x + (55 - 10√29) = 0Let me compute the discriminant:D = [16 - 2√29]^2 - 4*(55 - 10√29)Compute [16 - 2√29]^2:= 16² - 2*16*2√29 + (2√29)^2= 256 - 64√29 + 4*29= 256 - 64√29 + 116= 372 - 64√29Now, compute 4*(55 - 10√29) = 220 - 40√29So, D = (372 - 64√29) - (220 - 40√29) = 372 - 64√29 - 220 + 40√29 = 152 - 24√29Hmm, so discriminant is 152 - 24√29. Let me compute that numerically:√29 ≈ 5.38524√29 ≈ 24*5.385 ≈ 129.24So, 152 - 129.24 ≈ 22.76So, D ≈ 22.76, which is positive, so real roots.But I don't think this helps me much. Maybe another approach.Wait, perhaps I can write 16 - 2√29 + 2√(55 - 10√29) as (√(something))^2.Alternatively, maybe I can substitute t = √29, so that the expression becomes 16 - 2t + 2√(55 - 10t). Maybe that can be expressed as a square.Let me denote:Let me set 16 - 2t + 2√(55 - 10t) = (√a + √b)^2Then, expanding:a + b + 2√(ab) = 16 - 2t + 2√(55 - 10t)So, equate:a + b = 16 - 2tand2√(ab) = 2√(55 - 10t) => √(ab) = √(55 - 10t) => ab = 55 - 10tSo, same as before. So, we have a + b = 16 - 2t and ab = 55 - 10t.Let me try to solve for a and b.From a + b = 16 - 2t, so b = 16 - 2t - aSubstitute into ab = 55 - 10t:a*(16 - 2t - a) = 55 - 10t16a - 2ta - a² = 55 - 10tRearranged:a² - (16 - 2t)a + (55 - 10t) = 0Quadratic in a: a² - (16 - 2t)a + (55 - 10t) = 0Compute discriminant D:D = [16 - 2t]^2 - 4*(55 - 10t)Compute [16 - 2t]^2:= 256 - 64t + 4t²So, D = 256 - 64t + 4t² - 220 + 40t = (256 - 220) + (-64t + 40t) + 4t² = 36 - 24t + 4t²Factor: 4t² -24t +36 = 4(t² -6t +9) = 4(t - 3)^2So, D = 4(t - 3)^2Therefore, a = [ (16 - 2t) ± √(4(t - 3)^2) ] / 2 = [16 - 2t ± 2|t - 3| ] / 2Since t = √29 ≈5.385 >3, so |t -3| = t -3Thus, a = [16 - 2t ± 2(t -3)] / 2Compute both possibilities:First, with the plus sign:a = [16 - 2t + 2t -6]/2 = (10)/2 = 5Second, with the minus sign:a = [16 - 2t - 2t +6]/2 = (22 -4t)/2 = 11 - 2tSo, a can be 5 or 11 - 2t.Therefore, if a =5, then b =16 -2t -5=11 -2tIf a=11 -2t, then b=5So, either way, a and b are 5 and 11 -2t.Therefore, 16 -2t + 2√(55 -10t) = (√5 + √(11 -2t))²But t =√29, so 11 -2t =11 -2√29.Therefore, 16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29) = (√5 + √(11 -2√29))²Therefore, √(16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29)) = √5 + √(11 -2√29)So, going back to B:B = √(11 + 2√29) + √(16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29)) = √(11 + 2√29) + √5 + √(11 -2√29)Wait a second, that's the same as A!Because A = √5 + √(11 + 2√29) + √(11 -2√29)So, A and B are equal? That can't be right, can it?Wait, let me double-check.A = √5 + √(22 + 2√5) = √5 + √(11 + 2√29) + √(11 -2√29)B = √(11 + 2√29) + √(16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29)) = √(11 + 2√29) + √5 + √(11 -2√29)So, yes, both A and B are equal to √5 + √(11 + 2√29) + √(11 -2√29). Therefore, A = B.Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify numerically.Compute A:First, compute √5 ≈2.236Compute √(22 + 2√5): 22 + 2*2.236 ≈22 +4.472≈26.472. √26.472≈5.145So, A≈2.236 +5.145≈7.381Compute B:First, compute √(11 + 2√29): √29≈5.385, so 2√29≈10.77. 11 +10.77≈21.77. √21.77≈4.666Second, compute the inner square root: √(55 -10√29). 10√29≈53.85, so 55 -53.85≈1.15. √1.15≈1.072Then, compute the second term inside B: 16 -2√29 + 2*1.072≈16 -10.77 +2.144≈16 -10.77=5.23 +2.144≈7.374Then, √7.374≈2.715So, B≈4.666 +2.715≈7.381So, both A and B≈7.381, so they are equal.Wait, but the problem says \\"relative magnitude of the numbers A and B\\", so maybe they are equal. But let me check my calculations again because sometimes approximations can be misleading.Wait, in the exact expressions, A and B both simplify to the same expression, so they must be equal. Therefore, A = B.But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.Starting with A:√(22 + 2√5) was expressed as √(11 + 2√29) + √(11 -2√29). Then, A becomes √5 + √(11 + 2√29) + √(11 -2√29)For B, the second term was √(16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29)), which was expressed as √5 + √(11 -2√29). So, B becomes √(11 + 2√29) + √5 + √(11 -2√29), which is the same as A.Therefore, A and B are equal.But wait, let me check the step where I expressed √(16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29)) as √5 + √(11 -2√29). I think that's correct because we had:16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29) = (√5 + √(11 -2√29))²Expanding the right side:(√5)^2 + 2√5√(11 -2√29) + (√(11 -2√29))^2 =5 + 2√{5*(11 -2√29)} + (11 -2√29)Simplify:5 + 11 -2√29 + 2√{55 -10√29} =16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29)Which matches the left side. So, that step is correct.Therefore, A and B are indeed equal.But just to be thorough, let me compute A and B numerically with more precision.Compute A:√5 ≈2.2360679775Compute √(22 + 2√5):2√5≈4.47213595522 +4.472135955≈26.472135955√26.472135955≈5.145038173So, A≈2.2360679775 +5.145038173≈7.38110615Compute B:First term: √(11 + 2√29)√29≈5.3851648072√29≈10.7703296111 +10.77032961≈21.77032961√21.77032961≈4.666055046Second term: √(16 -2√29 + 2√(55 -10√29))Compute inner square root: √(55 -10√29)10√29≈53.8516480755 -53.85164807≈1.14835193√1.14835193≈1.07166538Then, compute 16 -2√29 + 2*1.07166538≈16 -10.77032961 +2.14333076≈16 -10.77032961≈5.22967039 +2.14333076≈7.37300115√7.37300115≈2.71532764So, B≈4.666055046 +2.71532764≈7.381382686Comparing A≈7.38110615 and B≈7.381382686, they are very close, with a slight difference due to rounding errors in the calculations. Therefore, A and B are equal.So, the relative magnitude is that they are equal.**Final Answer**boxed{A = B}"},{"question":"On an indoor circular track of circumference 50 feet, Joneal starts at point S, runs in a counterclockwise direction, and then stops when he has run exactly one mile (5280 feet).

The original cube is 3 cm by 3 cm by 3 cm. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.First, I should visualize the cube. A 3x3x3 cube is like a Rubik's cube, right? It's made up of 27 smaller cubes, each 1 cm on each side. Now, the problem says each corner cube is removed. A cube has 8 corners, so we're removing 8 small cubes in total. Each of these corner cubes is a 1x1x1 cube.Now, I need to figure out how removing each corner cube affects the surface area. Surface area is the total area of all the faces of the cube. The original cube has 6 faces, each of which is a 3x3 square. So, the original surface area is 6*(3*3) = 54 square centimeters. Okay, that's the starting point.But when we remove a corner cube, we're taking away a part of the original cube. Each corner cube is at a corner, so it's touching three faces of the original cube. When we remove it, we take away some area from each of those three faces, but we also expose new surfaces from the removed cube.Let me think about this. Each corner cube has three faces that are part of the original cube's surface. When we remove it, those three faces are no longer there, but the three faces of the corner cube that were previously internal are now exposed. So, for each corner cube removed, we lose 3 square centimeters (since each face is 1x1 cm) but gain 3 square centimeters from the newly exposed faces. Wait, does that mean the surface area remains the same?Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. Let me double-check. Each corner cube is at the intersection of three faces. So, each corner cube contributes 1 cm² to each of the three faces. When you remove the corner cube, you remove 1 cm² from each of those three faces, so the original surface area decreases by 3 cm². However, the removal also creates three new faces on the remaining cube, each of which is 1 cm². So, the surface area increases by 3 cm².So, for each corner cube removed, the net change in surface area is -3 + 3 = 0. That means the surface area remains the same as the original cube. So, if we remove all 8 corner cubes, the surface area remains 54 square centimeters.Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Each corner cube is removed, but when you remove a corner cube, you're affecting three faces, but each of those faces is shared with adjacent corner cubes. So, does removing one corner cube affect the surface area of the adjacent corner cubes?No, actually, each corner cube is independent in terms of the faces it's removing. Each corner cube is only attached to three faces, and removing it doesn't interfere with the removal of another corner cube because they are all at different corners. So, each removal is independent in terms of surface area change.Therefore, removing each corner cube doesn't change the total surface area because the loss and gain cancel out. So, the surface area remains 54 square centimeters.But wait, let me think again. The original surface area is 54. Each corner cube removal removes 3 cm² but adds 3 cm². So, 54 - 3 + 3 = 54. So, yes, it's the same.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each corner removal doesn't change the surface area because the removed area is equal to the added area. So, the total surface area remains unchanged.But let me also think about the structure after removal. When you remove a corner cube, you create a sort of notch in the corner. Each notch removes a corner but also exposes three new faces. So, each notch doesn't change the total surface area because the area removed is equal to the area added.So, if I remove all 8 corner cubes, each removal doesn't affect the total surface area. Therefore, the surface area remains 54 square centimeters.Wait, but let me check the answer choices. The options are 19, 24, 30, 54, and 72. 54 is one of them, so that seems to be the answer.But just to make sure, let me think about the surface area in another way. Maybe calculate the surface area after removal.Each corner cube removal affects three faces. So, for each corner, we have:- Original surface area contribution: 3 cm² (from the three faces)- After removal: 3 cm² (from the three new faces)So, net change is 0. Therefore, the total surface area remains 54.Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the surface area by considering the remaining structure.The original cube has 6 faces, each 9 cm², so 54 cm².After removing each corner, each corner removal doesn't change the total surface area because the area lost is equal to the area gained.Therefore, the surface area remains 54 cm².So, the answer should be D, 54 square centimeters.Wait, but let me think if there's another perspective. Maybe when you remove a corner cube, you're actually changing the shape in such a way that the surface area increases or decreases.But no, because each corner cube is only attached to three faces, and removing it takes away 3 cm² but adds 3 cm². So, it's a wash.Alternatively, maybe the surface area increases because the new faces are on the inside, but no, the new faces are on the outside now.Wait, no, when you remove a corner cube, the three faces that were internal to the cube are now exposed. So, each removal adds 3 cm², but subtracts 3 cm² from the original surface area. So, the net is zero.Therefore, the surface area remains the same.So, yeah, 54 is the answer.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, where a_5 + a_9 - a_7 = 10, and let S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n, then the value of S_{13} is.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\\"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, where a_5 + a_9 - a_7 = 10, and let S_n = a_1 + a_2 + … + a_n, then the value of S_{13} is.\\"Hmm, arithmetic sequences. I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a common difference to the previous term. So, the general formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.Alright, so the problem gives me an equation involving a_5, a_9, and a_7. Let me write that down:a_5 + a_9 - a_7 = 10.I need to find S_{13}, which is the sum of the first 13 terms of the sequence. I remember that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n - 1)d) or sometimes written as S_n = n*(a_1 + a_n)/2. Both formulas are equivalent.So, my goal is to find S_{13}, which would require knowing either a_1 and d, or maybe just a_1 and a_{13}, since S_{13} = 13*(a_1 + a_{13})/2.But first, let's work with the given equation: a_5 + a_9 - a_7 = 10.Let me express each of these terms using the general formula.a_5 = a_1 + (5 - 1)d = a_1 + 4da_9 = a_1 + (9 - 1)d = a_1 + 8da_7 = a_1 + (7 - 1)d = a_1 + 6dSo, substituting these into the equation:(a_1 + 4d) + (a_1 + 8d) - (a_1 + 6d) = 10Let me simplify this step by step.First, expand the terms:a_1 + 4d + a_1 + 8d - a_1 - 6d = 10Now, combine like terms.a_1 + a_1 - a_1 = (1 + 1 - 1)a_1 = a_14d + 8d - 6d = (4 + 8 - 6)d = 6dSo, the equation simplifies to:a_1 + 6d = 10Hmm, okay. So, a_1 + 6d = 10.Wait a second, a_1 + 6d is actually a_7, right? Because a_7 = a_1 + 6d. So, that means a_7 = 10.Interesting. So, the seventh term is 10.But how does that help me find S_{13}?Well, let's recall that S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n - 1)d). So, for n = 13, that would be:S_{13} = 13/2 * (2a_1 + 12d)Simplify that:S_{13} = 13/2 * (2a_1 + 12d) = 13*(a_1 + 6d)Wait, look at that! a_1 + 6d is exactly a_7, which we know is 10.So, substituting that in:S_{13} = 13*(10) = 130So, S_{13} is 130.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Expressed a_5, a_9, a_7 in terms of a_1 and d.2. Plugged them into the equation a_5 + a_9 - a_7 = 10.3. Simplified the equation to a_1 + 6d = 10, which is a_7 = 10.4. Remembered the formula for S_n and realized that S_{13} = 13*(a_1 + 6d).5. Substituted a_1 + 6d = 10 into the formula, resulting in 13*10 = 130.Yes, that seems correct. So, the value of S_{13} is 130.**Final Answer**The value of ( S_{13} ) is boxed{130}."},{"question":"Let r be the result of doubling both the base and exponent of a^b, and b does not equal to 0.

Hmm, arithmetic sequence, right? Let me remember what that means. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, that means each term is obtained by adding a common difference to the previous term.Alright, so the given sequence is 1, a, b, c, 9. Let me write that down:1, a, b, c, 9Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between each term is the same. Let's denote this common difference as d. So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + d, 1 + 2d, 1 + 3d, and so on.Wait, let me make sure. The first term is 1, the second term is a, so a should be 1 + d. Then the third term is b, which should be a + d, so that's 1 + 2d. The fourth term is c, which is b + d, so 1 + 3d. And the fifth term is 9, which is c + d, so 1 + 4d.So, let me write down each term in terms of d:1st term: 12nd term: a = 1 + d3rd term: b = 1 + 2d4th term: c = 1 + 3d5th term: 9 = 1 + 4dOkay, so the fifth term is 9, which is equal to 1 + 4d. So, I can solve for d here.Let me write that equation:1 + 4d = 9Subtract 1 from both sides:4d = 8Divide both sides by 4:d = 2So, the common difference d is 2. Now, let me find the values of a, b, and c.Starting with a:a = 1 + d = 1 + 2 = 3Then b:b = 1 + 2d = 1 + 4 = 5And c:c = 1 + 3d = 1 + 6 = 7So, the sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Let me check if that's an arithmetic sequence with common difference 2. Yes, 3 - 1 = 2, 5 - 3 = 2, 7 - 5 = 2, 9 - 7 = 2. Perfect.Now, the question is asking for c - a. So, c is 7 and a is 3.So, c - a = 7 - 3 = 4.Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. c is the fourth term, which is 7, a is the second term, which is 3. 7 - 3 is indeed 4. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I can find c - a without calculating each term. Let me think. Since a is the second term and c is the fourth term, the difference between them is two common differences. Because from a to b is one d, and from b to c is another d, so from a to c is 2d.Therefore, c - a = 2d. Since d is 2, 2d is 4. So, that's another way to see it.So, both methods give me the same answer, 4. That makes me more confident that it's correct.Just to recap:Given the arithmetic sequence: 1, a, b, c, 9We found the common difference d by using the fifth term:1 + 4d = 9 => d = 2Then, since c is the fourth term and a is the second term, the difference c - a is 2d, which is 4.Alternatively, calculating each term:a = 3, c = 7, so 7 - 3 = 4.Either way, the answer is 4.I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem straightforward, and both methods confirm the result. So, I feel confident that c - a is 4.**Final Answer**The value of ( c - a ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"How many numbers in the list ( 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 ) are prime numbers?

According to the tournament rules, each player played against every other player twice. How many players participated in total if it is known that the boys scored exactly twice as many points as the girls? (A win in a chess game earns 1 point, a draw earns 0.5 points, and a loss earns 0 points.)","answer":"Alright, so I have this chess tournament problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, the problem says that in a school chess tournament, boys and girls competed, and the number of boys was five times the number of girls. So, if I let the number of girls be G, then the number of boys would be 5G. Therefore, the total number of players would be G + 5G, which is 6G. So, the total number of participants is 6G. But I don't know G yet, so I need to find G.Next, the tournament rules state that each player played against every other player twice. Hmm, okay. So, in a round-robin tournament, each player plays every other player once, but here they play each other twice. That means each pair of players plays two games against each other. I remember that the total number of games in a round-robin tournament where each pair plays once is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2. Since each pair plays twice, the total number of games would be 2 * C(n, 2) = 2 * [n(n-1)/2] = n(n-1). So, the total number of games is n(n-1), where n is the total number of players.But wait, each game results in a total of 1 point being awarded (either 1 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 0.5 each for a draw). Therefore, the total number of points scored by all players combined is equal to the total number of games, which is n(n-1). So, total points = n(n - 1). But the problem says that the boys scored exactly twice as many points as the girls. So, if I let the total points scored by girls be P, then the total points scored by boys would be 2P. Therefore, the total points would be P + 2P = 3P. But we also know that the total points are n(n - 1). So, 3P = n(n - 1). Therefore, P = n(n - 1)/3. So, the girls scored n(n - 1)/3 points, and the boys scored 2n(n - 1)/3 points.Now, I need to find n, which is the total number of players, which is 6G, as established earlier. So, n = 6G. Let me write down what I have so far:- Number of girls: G- Number of boys: 5G- Total players: n = 6G- Total games: n(n - 1) = 6G(6G - 1)- Total points: 6G(6G - 1)- Girls' total points: P = 6G(6G - 1)/3 = 2G(6G - 1)- Boys' total points: 2P = 4G(6G - 1)So, the girls scored 2G(6G - 1) points, and the boys scored 4G(6G - 1) points.Now, I need to find the number of points scored by girls and boys in terms of their own games and games against each other.Let me think about how the points are distributed. Each player plays against every other player twice, so each girl plays against all other girls twice and against all boys twice. Similarly, each boy plays against all other boys twice and against all girls twice.Therefore, the total number of games among girls is C(G, 2) * 2, and the total number of games between girls and boys is G * 5G * 2.Similarly, the total number of games among boys is C(5G, 2) * 2.So, the total points scored by girls can be broken down into two parts:1. Points scored in games among girls.2. Points scored in games between girls and boys.Similarly, the total points scored by boys can be broken down into:1. Points scored in games among boys.2. Points scored in games between boys and girls.But since the points in inter-gender games are split between girls and boys, we need to consider how the points are distributed in those games.Let me denote:- Let S_gg be the total points scored by girls in games among girls.- Let S_gb be the total points scored by girls in games against boys.- Similarly, S_bb is the total points scored by boys in games among boys.- S_bg is the total points scored by boys in games against girls.But since each game between a girl and a boy contributes to both S_gb and S_bg, and the total points from these games is equal to the number of games between girls and boys, which is 2 * G * 5G = 10G².Therefore, S_gb + S_bg = 10G².But we also know that S_gb is the points girls scored against boys, and S_bg is the points boys scored against girls.From the problem, we know that total points by girls: S_gg + S_gb = 2G(6G - 1)And total points by boys: S_bb + S_bg = 4G(6G - 1)Also, the total points in games among girls is S_gg, which is equal to the total points from all games among girls. The number of games among girls is C(G, 2) * 2 = G(G - 1). So, the total points from games among girls is G(G - 1). Therefore, S_gg = G(G - 1).Similarly, the total points from games among boys is C(5G, 2) * 2 = 5G(5G - 1). Therefore, S_bb = 5G(5G - 1).So, now we can write:For girls:S_gg + S_gb = 2G(6G - 1)But S_gg = G(G - 1), so:G(G - 1) + S_gb = 2G(6G - 1)Therefore, S_gb = 2G(6G - 1) - G(G - 1)Let me compute that:S_gb = 12G² - 2G - G² + G = (12G² - G²) + (-2G + G) = 11G² - GSimilarly, for boys:S_bb + S_bg = 4G(6G - 1)But S_bb = 5G(5G - 1) = 25G² - 5GSo:25G² - 5G + S_bg = 24G² - 4GTherefore, S_bg = 24G² - 4G - 25G² + 5G = (-G²) + GSo, S_bg = -G² + GBut we also know that S_gb + S_bg = 10G²From above, S_gb = 11G² - G and S_bg = -G² + GSo, adding them together:(11G² - G) + (-G² + G) = 10G²Simplify:11G² - G - G² + G = 10G²Which simplifies to:10G² = 10G²Hmm, that's an identity, which doesn't give us new information. So, that approach might not help us find G.Maybe I need another approach.Wait, perhaps I can think about the points girls scored against boys and the points boys scored against girls.We have S_gb = 11G² - G and S_bg = -G² + GBut S_gb + S_bg = 10G², which we already know.But perhaps we can find the ratio of S_gb to S_bg.Given that S_gb = 11G² - G and S_bg = -G² + GSo, the ratio of girls' points against boys to boys' points against girls is (11G² - G) / (-G² + G)But I don't know if that ratio is meaningful.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the total points girls earned in inter-gender games and the total points boys earned in inter-gender games.Given that S_gb = 11G² - G and S_bg = -G² + G, and S_gb + S_bg = 10G².But perhaps I can set up an equation based on the fact that the points girls earned in inter-gender games plus the points they earned in intra-gender games equals their total points.Wait, but we already used that.Hmm, maybe I need to think about the fact that the number of games between girls and boys is 10G², and each game contributes 1 point in total.So, the total points from inter-gender games is 10G², which is equal to S_gb + S_bg.But we have S_gb = 11G² - G and S_bg = -G² + G, so 11G² - G - G² + G = 10G², which is consistent.But perhaps I can think about the points girls earned in inter-gender games as a fraction of the total inter-gender points.So, S_gb / (S_gb + S_bg) = (11G² - G) / 10G²Similarly, S_bg / (S_gb + S_bg) = (-G² + G) / 10G²But I don't know if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the average points per game in inter-gender games.Wait, perhaps another approach is to model the points scored by girls and boys in inter-gender games.Let me denote that in the games between girls and boys, each girl plays 2 games against each boy, so each girl plays 2 * 5G = 10G games against boys.Similarly, each boy plays 2 * G = 2G games against girls.But wait, that might complicate things.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the total number of games between girls and boys is 2 * G * 5G = 10G² games, as before.Each of these games contributes 1 point in total, so the total points from these games is 10G².We have S_gb = 11G² - G and S_bg = -G² + GBut S_gb + S_bg = 10G², which is correct.But perhaps I can think about the ratio of S_gb to S_bg.So, S_gb / S_bg = (11G² - G) / (-G² + G)But since S_gb and S_bg are points scored by girls and boys in inter-gender games, perhaps this ratio can be related to something else.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the fact that the points girls scored in inter-gender games is 11G² - G, and the points boys scored in inter-gender games is -G² + G.But wait, S_bg = -G² + G. That seems odd because if G is a positive integer, then for G > 1, -G² + G would be negative, which doesn't make sense because points can't be negative.Wait, that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.Let me go back.We had:Total points by girls: S_gg + S_gb = 2G(6G - 1)We know S_gg = G(G - 1), so:G(G - 1) + S_gb = 12G² - 2GTherefore, S_gb = 12G² - 2G - G² + G = 11G² - GSimilarly, for boys:Total points by boys: S_bb + S_bg = 4G(6G - 1) = 24G² - 4GWe know S_bb = 5G(5G - 1) = 25G² - 5GSo, 25G² - 5G + S_bg = 24G² - 4GTherefore, S_bg = 24G² - 4G - 25G² + 5G = (-G²) + GSo, S_bg = -G² + GBut S_bg can't be negative. So, -G² + G >= 0Which implies G² - G <= 0So, G(G - 1) <= 0Which implies G <= 1, since G is a positive integer.But G is the number of girls, so G must be at least 1.Therefore, G can only be 1.Wait, that seems strange. So, G = 1.Therefore, number of girls is 1, number of boys is 5, total players is 6.But let me check if that makes sense.If G = 1, then:- Number of girls: 1- Number of boys: 5- Total players: 6Total games: 6 * 5 = 30 games, so total points: 30.Total points by girls: 2G(6G - 1) = 2*1*(6*1 - 1) = 2*(5) = 10Total points by boys: 4G(6G - 1) = 4*1*(5) = 20So, girls scored 10 points, boys scored 20 points, total 30 points. That checks out.Now, let's check the points in inter-gender games.S_gb = 11G² - G = 11*1 - 1 = 10S_bg = -G² + G = -1 + 1 = 0So, girls scored 10 points against boys, and boys scored 0 points against girls.But that would mean that in all games between girls and boys, the girls won all their games, which is possible.But let's see if that's consistent.Number of inter-gender games: 10G² = 10*1 = 10 games.Each game contributes 1 point, so total points from inter-gender games: 10.Girls scored all 10 points, boys scored 0.That would mean that in all 10 games between the single girl and the 5 boys, the girl won all her games, which is possible.But let's check the points in intra-gender games.For girls: S_gg = G(G - 1) = 1*0 = 0. That makes sense because there's only one girl, so no games among girls.For boys: S_bb = 5G(5G - 1) = 5*1*(5 - 1) = 5*4 = 20But wait, total points by boys is 20, which is all from intra-gender games, since S_bg = 0.But let's check the total points from intra-gender games among boys.Number of games among boys: C(5, 2)*2 = 10*2 = 20 games, so total points: 20.Therefore, S_bb = 20, which matches.So, in this case, the boys scored all their points in their games against each other, and the girl scored all her points in her games against the boys.This seems consistent.But wait, the problem says \\"the boys scored exactly twice as many points as the girls.\\" In this case, boys scored 20, girls scored 10, which is exactly twice as much. So, that works.But is this the only solution? Because when I set up the equation, I found that G must be 1 because S_bg = -G² + G must be non-negative, so G can only be 1.Therefore, the total number of players is 6G = 6*1 = 6.So, the answer is 6 players.But wait, let me double-check if G=1 is the only solution.Suppose G=2.Then, S_bg = -4 + 2 = -2, which is negative, which is impossible.Similarly, G=3, S_bg = -9 + 3 = -6, negative.G=0 is not possible because there are girls in the tournament.Therefore, G must be 1.Hence, total players = 6.So, the answer is 6 players.**Final Answer**The total number of players is boxed{6}."},{"question":"Let (left|a_{n}right| (n geqslant 1)) be an arithmetic sequence with a common difference less than 0.

(S_{n} leqslant S_{n+1})\\"Alright, so first, let's recall what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. The common difference is given as less than 0, so that means it's a decreasing arithmetic sequence.Given that, let me denote the first term as (a_1) and the common difference as (d), where (d < 0). So, the nth term (a_n) can be written as:(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d)Since (d) is negative, each subsequent term is smaller than the previous one. That means (a_1 > a_2 > a_3 > dots > a_n > dots)Now, the sum of the first (n) terms, (S_n), is given by the formula:(S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n))Alternatively, since (a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d), we can also write:(S_n = frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n - 1)d])But maybe the first formula is more useful here because it relates (S_n) to the average of the first and nth term multiplied by the number of terms.So, let's look at the options one by one.Option A: (n a_{n} leqslant S_{n} leqslant n a_{1})Option B: (n a_{1} leqslant S_{n} leqslant n a_{n})Option C: (S_{n} geqslant S_{n+1})Option D: (S_{n} leqslant S_{n+1})Hmm. So, for options A and B, they are comparing (S_n) to (n a_1) and (n a_n). Let me think about what (n a_1) and (n a_n) represent.Since (S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)), this is the average of the first and nth term multiplied by the number of terms. So, (S_n) is equal to the average of (a_1) and (a_n) times (n).Now, since (a_1 > a_n) (because the sequence is decreasing), the average of (a_1) and (a_n) is somewhere between (a_n) and (a_1). Therefore, (S_n) should be between (n a_n) and (n a_1). So, (n a_n < S_n < n a_1). But wait, since (a_n < a_1), multiplying by (n) preserves the inequality.But hold on, in the options, A says (n a_n leqslant S_n leqslant n a_1), and B says the opposite. So, based on what I just thought, since (S_n) is the average, it should be between (n a_n) and (n a_1). So, A is correct? Or is there a mistake here?Wait, let me verify with an example. Let's take a simple arithmetic sequence where (a_1 = 5) and (d = -1). So, the sequence is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, etc.Let's compute (S_3). The first three terms are 5, 4, 3. So, (S_3 = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12). Now, (n a_1 = 3 * 5 = 15), and (n a_n = 3 * 3 = 9). So, (9 leqslant 12 leqslant 15), which is true. So, in this case, A holds.Wait, but let me test another term. Let's take (n = 5). The first five terms are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. So, (S_5 = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15). (n a_1 = 5 * 5 = 25), (n a_n = 5 * 1 = 5). So, 5 ≤ 15 ≤ 25, which is also true.But wait, what if the sequence is such that (a_n) becomes negative? Let's take (n = 6). The sixth term is 0, so (a_6 = 0). (S_6 = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 15). (n a_1 = 6 * 5 = 30), (n a_n = 6 * 0 = 0). So, 0 ≤ 15 ≤ 30, which is still true.Wait, but what if (a_n) is negative? Let's take (n = 7). (a_7 = -1), so (S_7 = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + (-1) = 14). (n a_1 = 7 * 5 = 35), (n a_n = 7 * (-1) = -7). So, -7 ≤ 14 ≤ 35, which is true.But wait, in this case, (S_n) is still between (n a_n) and (n a_1). So, A seems correct.But hold on, let's think about another case where (a_1) is negative. Wait, but the common difference is less than 0, so if (a_1) is negative, the sequence becomes more negative. Let me try that.Let me take (a_1 = -1) and (d = -1). So, the sequence is -1, -2, -3, -4, etc.Compute (S_3). The first three terms are -1, -2, -3. So, (S_3 = -6). (n a_1 = 3 * (-1) = -3), (n a_n = 3 * (-3) = -9). So, -9 ≤ -6 ≤ -3. Which is true.Similarly, (n = 2): (S_2 = -3), (n a_1 = -2), (n a_n = -4). So, -4 ≤ -3 ≤ -2, which is true.Wait, so in both cases, whether (a_1) is positive or negative, as long as the common difference is negative, (S_n) is between (n a_n) and (n a_1). So, A is correct.But wait, let me check another example where (a_1) is positive, but the sequence goes into negative.Take (a_1 = 3), (d = -2). So, the sequence is 3, 1, -1, -3, etc.Compute (S_3 = 3 + 1 + (-1) = 3). (n a_1 = 3 * 3 = 9), (n a_n = 3 * (-1) = -3). So, -3 ≤ 3 ≤ 9, which is true.Compute (S_4 = 3 + 1 + (-1) + (-3) = 0). (n a_1 = 4 * 3 = 12), (n a_n = 4 * (-3) = -12). So, -12 ≤ 0 ≤ 12, which is true.Wait, but in this case, (S_4 = 0), which is still between -12 and 12. So, A holds.Hmm, so A seems correct.But let me think about whether this is always the case.Given that (S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)), and since (a_1 > a_n) (because (d < 0)), then (a_n < a_1). So, the average of (a_1) and (a_n) is less than (a_1) and greater than (a_n). Therefore, (S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)) is less than (frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_1) = n a_1), and greater than (frac{n}{2}(a_n + a_n) = n a_n). So, (n a_n < S_n < n a_1). But since the inequalities are non-strict in the options, it's (n a_n leqslant S_n leqslant n a_1). So, A is correct.But wait, is it possible for (S_n) to equal (n a_n) or (n a_1)? Let's see.If (a_1 = a_n), then the sequence is constant, but since the common difference is less than 0, (a_1) cannot equal (a_n) unless (n = 1). So, for (n geq 2), (a_1 neq a_n). So, (S_n) is strictly between (n a_n) and (n a_1). Therefore, the inequalities in A should be strict, but the options use non-strict inequalities. So, A is still correct because it's allowing equality, which doesn't occur except when (n = 1). For (n = 1), (S_1 = a_1), so (n a_n = n a_1 = a_1), so equality holds. So, A is correct.But wait, let me check for (n = 1). (S_1 = a_1), (n a_1 = a_1), (n a_n = a_1). So, equality holds on both sides. So, A is correct for all (n geq 1).So, A is correct.But let me check the other options as well.Option B: (n a_{1} leqslant S_{n} leqslant n a_{n})But we just saw that (S_n) is between (n a_n) and (n a_1), with (n a_n < S_n < n a_1). So, B is the reverse, which would be incorrect.Option C: (S_{n} geqslant S_{n+1})Option D: (S_{n} leqslant S_{n+1})So, what's the relationship between (S_n) and (S_{n+1})?Well, (S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1}). So, whether (S_{n+1}) is greater or less than (S_n) depends on the sign of (a_{n+1}).Given that the sequence is decreasing, (a_{n+1} = a_n + d). Since (d < 0), (a_{n+1} < a_n). So, if (a_{n+1}) is positive, adding it to (S_n) will make (S_{n+1} > S_n). If (a_{n+1}) is negative, adding it to (S_n) will make (S_{n+1} < S_n).So, the behavior of (S_n) depends on whether the terms are positive or negative.So, let's think about when the terms are positive and when they become negative.In the earlier example where (a_1 = 5), (d = -1), the terms are positive until (a_6 = 0), and then negative after that.So, for (n = 1) to (n = 5), (a_{n+1}) is positive, so (S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1} > S_n). So, (S_n) is increasing.But when (n = 5), (a_6 = 0), so (S_6 = S_5 + 0 = S_5). So, (S_6 = S_5).Then, for (n = 6), (a_7 = -1), so (S_7 = S_6 + (-1) = 14), which is less than (S_6 = 15). So, (S_7 < S_6).So, in this case, (S_n) increases up to (n = 5), stays the same at (n = 6), and then starts decreasing.So, depending on the value of (n), (S_n) can be increasing or decreasing.Therefore, neither (S_n geqslant S_{n+1}) nor (S_n leqslant S_{n+1}) is always true.Wait, but let's think about another example where all terms are positive. For instance, (a_1 = 10), (d = -1). So, the terms are 10, 9, 8, 7, ..., which are all positive. So, in this case, each (a_{n+1}) is positive, so (S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1} > S_n). So, (S_n) is always increasing. So, in this case, (S_n leqslant S_{n+1}) is true for all (n), but (S_n geqslant S_{n+1}) is false.But wait, in the previous example, (S_n) started decreasing after a certain point. So, depending on whether the terms are all positive or some are negative, the behavior of (S_n) changes.Therefore, neither C nor D is always correct. It depends on the specific sequence.Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the common difference is less than 0, but it doesn't specify whether the terms are positive or negative. So, the behavior of (S_n) can vary.Therefore, options C and D are not necessarily always correct.But wait, let me think about the general case.Given that (d < 0), the sequence is decreasing. So, the terms will eventually become negative if the sequence is long enough. But depending on (a_1) and (d), the terms might stay positive forever or become negative after some point.Wait, actually, in an arithmetic sequence with a negative common difference, the terms will eventually become negative if you go far enough, unless (a_1) is also negative and (d) is negative, making the terms more negative.Wait, no, if (a_1) is negative and (d) is negative, the terms become more negative, so they never become positive.Wait, let me clarify.Case 1: (a_1 > 0), (d < 0). Then, the terms start positive and eventually become negative.Case 2: (a_1 < 0), (d < 0). Then, the terms are always negative and become more negative.So, in Case 1, the sum (S_n) will first increase, reach a maximum, and then start decreasing.In Case 2, the sum (S_n) will always be decreasing because each term is negative, so adding a negative term makes the sum smaller.Wait, let's test Case 2.Take (a_1 = -1), (d = -1). So, the sequence is -1, -2, -3, -4, etc.Compute (S_1 = -1), (S_2 = -3), (S_3 = -6), (S_4 = -10), etc. So, each (S_n) is less than the previous one. So, (S_n) is decreasing.So, in this case, (S_n geqslant S_{n+1}) is true because each subsequent sum is smaller.But in Case 1, (a_1 = 5), (d = -1), as before, (S_n) increases up to (n = 5), then starts decreasing.So, in that case, (S_n) is not always increasing or always decreasing. It first increases, then decreases.Therefore, depending on the initial term, (S_n) can either be always decreasing or first increasing then decreasing.Therefore, neither C nor D is always correct.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"the sum of the first (n) terms is denoted as (S_n). Which of the following is correct?\\"So, the options are about the relationship between (S_n) and (S_{n+1}). So, in some cases, (S_n) can be greater than or less than (S_{n+1}), depending on the term being added.Therefore, neither C nor D is always correct.Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \\"the sum of the first (n) terms is denoted as (S_n)\\", so (S_n) is defined for all (n geq 1). So, the behavior of (S_n) can vary depending on the sequence.Therefore, options C and D are not necessarily correct.So, going back, the only correct option is A.But wait, let me think again about options C and D. Maybe I'm missing something.Wait, in the problem statement, it's given that the common difference is less than 0, so the sequence is decreasing. So, if (a_1) is positive, the terms will eventually become negative, but if (a_1) is negative, the terms will always be negative.So, in the case where (a_1) is positive, (S_n) will first increase, reach a maximum, and then decrease. So, (S_n) is not always increasing or always decreasing.In the case where (a_1) is negative, (S_n) is always decreasing because each term is negative, so adding a negative term makes the sum smaller.But the problem doesn't specify whether (a_1) is positive or negative. It just says the common difference is less than 0.Therefore, depending on (a_1), (S_n) can either be always decreasing or first increasing then decreasing.So, in some cases, (S_n) can be greater than (S_{n+1}), and in other cases, (S_n) can be less than (S_{n+1}). Therefore, neither C nor D is always correct.Therefore, the only correct option is A.But wait, let me check the options again.A. (n a_{n} leqslant S_{n} leqslant n a_{1})B. (n a_{1} leqslant S_{n} leqslant n a_{n})C. (S_{n} geqslant S_{n+1})D. (S_{n} leqslant S_{n+1})So, A is correct because (S_n) is the average of (a_1) and (a_n) multiplied by (n), so it's between (n a_n) and (n a_1).B is incorrect because it reverses the inequality.C and D are not necessarily correct because (S_n) can be increasing or decreasing depending on the sequence.Therefore, the correct answer is A.But wait, hold on. Let me think about another example where (a_1) is positive, and the sequence becomes negative.Take (a_1 = 3), (d = -2). So, the sequence is 3, 1, -1, -3, -5, etc.Compute (S_1 = 3), (S_2 = 4), (S_3 = 3), (S_4 = 0), (S_5 = -5), etc.So, (S_1 = 3), (S_2 = 4), (S_3 = 3), (S_4 = 0), (S_5 = -5).So, (S_1 < S_2), (S_2 > S_3), (S_3 > S_4), (S_4 > S_5), etc.So, in this case, (S_n) increases from (n=1) to (n=2), then decreases from (n=2) onwards.So, in this case, (S_2 > S_3), so (S_n) is not always increasing or always decreasing.Therefore, neither C nor D is correct.So, the only correct option is A.Wait, but let me think about another case where (a_1) is positive, and the sequence never becomes negative. Is that possible?Wait, no, because if (d < 0), eventually, the terms will become negative. For example, (a_1 = 100), (d = -1). The terms will decrease by 1 each time, so eventually, they will reach 0 and become negative.Therefore, in all cases where (a_1 > 0) and (d < 0), (S_n) will first increase, reach a maximum, then decrease.In cases where (a_1 < 0) and (d < 0), (S_n) will always decrease.Therefore, in some cases, (S_n) can be increasing, and in others, decreasing. So, neither C nor D is always correct.Therefore, the only correct answer is A.Wait, but let me check the initial terms.If (a_1) is positive, (a_2 = a_1 + d). Since (d < 0), (a_2 < a_1). So, (a_2) could still be positive or negative.If (a_2) is positive, then (S_2 = a_1 + a_2 > a_1), so (S_2 > S_1).If (a_2) is negative, then (S_2 = a_1 + a_2). Depending on how negative (a_2) is, (S_2) could be greater or less than (S_1).Wait, no. If (a_1) is positive and (a_2) is negative, (S_2 = a_1 + a_2). If (a_2) is negative, (S_2 = a_1 + a_2 < a_1). So, (S_2 < S_1).Wait, but in the case where (a_1 = 3), (d = -2), (a_2 = 1), which is still positive. So, (S_2 = 4 > 3 = S_1). Then, (a_3 = -1), so (S_3 = 3 < 4 = S_2).So, in this case, (S_n) increases from (n=1) to (n=2), then decreases.But in another case, if (a_1 = 1), (d = -1), so (a_2 = 0), (a_3 = -1), etc.Compute (S_1 = 1), (S_2 = 1 + 0 = 1), (S_3 = 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0), (S_4 = -1), etc.So, (S_1 = 1), (S_2 = 1), (S_3 = 0), (S_4 = -1). So, (S_2 = S_1), (S_3 < S_2), etc.So, in this case, (S_n) is non-increasing from (n=2) onwards, but (S_2 = S_1).So, depending on the specific values, (S_n) can stay the same or decrease.Therefore, in some cases, (S_n) can be equal to (S_{n+1}), but not necessarily always.Therefore, neither C nor D is always correct.So, the only correct option is A.Wait, but let me think about another aspect. The problem says \\"the sum of the first (n) terms is denoted as (S_n). Which of the following is correct?\\"So, the options are about inequalities involving (S_n). So, A and B are about (S_n) being between (n a_n) and (n a_1), and C and D are about whether (S_n) is increasing or decreasing.We've established that A is correct because (S_n) is the average of (a_1) and (a_n) times (n), so it's between (n a_n) and (n a_1).But let me think about whether this holds for all (n).Yes, because regardless of whether (a_n) is positive or negative, the average of (a_1) and (a_n) will always be between (a_n) and (a_1), so multiplying by (n) preserves the inequality.Therefore, A is correct.So, the answer is A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"In the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, the parametric equation of line l is begin{cases} x=1- frac {1}{2}t  y= frac { sqrt {3}}{2}t end{cases} (where t is the parameter).

(Ⅰ) Write the standard equation of line l and the Cartesian coordinate equation of circle C;  (Ⅱ) If the Cartesian coordinates of point P are (1,0), and circle C intersects line l at points A and B, find the value of |PA|+|PB|.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem in front of me, and I need to solve it step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.First, part (Ⅰ) is asking me to write the standard equation of line ( l ) and the Cartesian coordinate equation of circle ( C ). Then, part (Ⅱ) is about finding the value of ( |PA| + |PB| ) where point ( P ) is at ( (1, 0) ), and points ( A ) and ( B ) are the intersections of circle ( C ) and line ( l ).Starting with part (Ⅰ). The parametric equations for line ( l ) are given as:[begin{cases}x = 1 - frac{1}{2} t y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} tend{cases}]where ( t ) is the parameter. I need to convert this parametric form into the standard Cartesian equation. I remember that to eliminate the parameter ( t ), I can solve one of the equations for ( t ) and substitute it into the other. Let me take the first equation:[x = 1 - frac{1}{2} t]Solving for ( t ):[x - 1 = -frac{1}{2} t Rightarrow t = -2(x - 1) Rightarrow t = 2(1 - x)]Now, substitute this expression for ( t ) into the second equation:[y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} t = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times 2(1 - x) = sqrt{3}(1 - x)]Simplify this:[y = sqrt{3} - sqrt{3}x]So, rearranging terms:[y = -sqrt{3}x + sqrt{3}]That's the standard equation of line ( l ). Alternatively, it can be written as:[sqrt{3}x + y = sqrt{3}]Either form is acceptable, but I think the slope-intercept form ( y = mx + b ) is probably the standard form they're asking for. So, I'll stick with ( y = -sqrt{3}x + sqrt{3} ).Now, moving on to the equation of circle ( C ). The polar equation is given as:[rho = 2sqrt{3} sin theta]I need to convert this into Cartesian coordinates. I remember that in polar coordinates, ( rho = 2a sin theta ) represents a circle with radius ( a ) centered at ( (0, a) ). So, in this case, ( 2a = 2sqrt{3} ), which means ( a = sqrt{3} ). Therefore, the circle should be centered at ( (0, sqrt{3}) ) with radius ( sqrt{3} ).But let me verify that by converting the polar equation to Cartesian. The general conversion formulas are:[rho = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, quad sin theta = frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}]Substituting into the given equation:[sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 2sqrt{3} times frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}]Multiply both sides by ( sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ):[x^2 + y^2 = 2sqrt{3} y]Bring all terms to one side:[x^2 + y^2 - 2sqrt{3} y = 0]To write this in standard form, I can complete the square for the ( y )-terms. Let's see:[x^2 + (y^2 - 2sqrt{3} y) = 0]Complete the square for ( y ):Take the coefficient of ( y ), which is ( -2sqrt{3} ), divide by 2 to get ( -sqrt{3} ), and square it to get ( 3 ). So, add and subtract 3:[x^2 + (y^2 - 2sqrt{3} y + 3 - 3) = 0 Rightarrow x^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 - 3 = 0 Rightarrow x^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3]So, the Cartesian equation of circle ( C ) is:[x^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3]That's a circle centered at ( (0, sqrt{3}) ) with radius ( sqrt{3} ). Perfect, that matches my initial thought.So, part (Ⅰ) is done. The standard equation of line ( l ) is ( y = -sqrt{3}x + sqrt{3} ), and the Cartesian equation of circle ( C ) is ( x^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 ).Moving on to part (Ⅱ). We have point ( P ) at ( (1, 0) ). Circle ( C ) intersects line ( l ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). We need to find ( |PA| + |PB| ).Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the points ( A ) and ( B ) where line ( l ) intersects circle ( C ), then compute the distances from ( P ) to each of these points and add them together.Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute ( |PA| + |PB| ) without explicitly finding ( A ) and ( B ). But let me first try the straightforward approach.First, let's find the points ( A ) and ( B ). Since they lie on both line ( l ) and circle ( C ), their coordinates satisfy both equations.We already have the equation of line ( l ) as ( y = -sqrt{3}x + sqrt{3} ). Let's substitute this into the equation of circle ( C ):[x^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3]Substituting ( y = -sqrt{3}x + sqrt{3} ):[x^2 + left( -sqrt{3}x + sqrt{3} - sqrt{3} right)^2 = 3 Simplify inside the square:[x^2 + (-sqrt{3}x)^2 = 3 Compute ( (-sqrt{3}x)^2 ):[x^2 + 3x^2 = 3 Combine like terms:[4x^2 = 3 Divide both sides by 4:[x^2 = frac{3}{4} Take square roots:[x = pm frac{sqrt{3}}{2}]So, the x-coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ) are ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) and ( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).Now, let's find the corresponding y-coordinates using the equation of line ( l ):For ( x = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ):[y = -sqrt{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + sqrt{3} = -frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3}]Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me compute it again:[y = -sqrt{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + sqrt{3} = -frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3}]Yes, that's correct. Similarly, for ( x = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ):[y = -sqrt{3} times left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) + sqrt{3} = frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3}]So, the coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ) are:[A left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, -frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right) quad text{and} quad B left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right)]Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the y-coordinates.For ( x = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ):[y = -sqrt{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + sqrt{3} = -frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3}]Yes, that's correct.For ( x = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ):[y = -sqrt{3} times left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) + sqrt{3} = frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3}]Yes, that seems right too.So, points ( A ) and ( B ) are as above.Now, point ( P ) is at ( (1, 0) ). We need to compute ( |PA| ) and ( |PB| ), then add them.Let me compute ( |PA| ) first.Coordinates of ( P ): ( (1, 0) )Coordinates of ( A ): ( left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, -frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right) )Distance formula:[|PA| = sqrt{ left( 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 + left( 0 - left( -frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right) right)^2 }]Simplify each component:First component (x-direction):[1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{2}]Second component (y-direction):[0 - left( -frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right) = frac{3}{2} - sqrt{3}]So, plug into the distance formula:[|PA| = sqrt{ left( frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{3}{2} - sqrt{3} right)^2 }]Compute each square:First square:[left( frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 = frac{(2 - sqrt{3})^2}{4} = frac{4 - 4sqrt{3} + 3}{4} = frac{7 - 4sqrt{3}}{4}]Second square:[left( frac{3}{2} - sqrt{3} right)^2 = left( frac{3}{2} right)^2 - 2 times frac{3}{2} times sqrt{3} + (sqrt{3})^2 = frac{9}{4} - 3sqrt{3} + 3 = frac{9}{4} + 3 - 3sqrt{3} = frac{21}{4} - 3sqrt{3}]Wait, hold on. Let me compute that again.Wait, ( left( frac{3}{2} - sqrt{3} right)^2 ) is:[left( frac{3}{2} right)^2 - 2 times frac{3}{2} times sqrt{3} + (sqrt{3})^2 = frac{9}{4} - 3sqrt{3} + 3]Convert 3 to fourths: ( 3 = frac{12}{4} )So, total:[frac{9}{4} + frac{12}{4} - 3sqrt{3} = frac{21}{4} - 3sqrt{3}]So, that's correct.Therefore, ( |PA| ) becomes:[|PA| = sqrt{ frac{7 - 4sqrt{3}}{4} + frac{21}{4} - 3sqrt{3} } = sqrt{ frac{7 - 4sqrt{3} + 21}{4} - 3sqrt{3} } = sqrt{ frac{28 - 4sqrt{3}}{4} - 3sqrt{3} }]Simplify ( frac{28 - 4sqrt{3}}{4} ):[frac{28}{4} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{4} = 7 - sqrt{3}]So, now:[|PA| = sqrt{7 - sqrt{3} - 3sqrt{3}} = sqrt{7 - 4sqrt{3}}]Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me see if I can simplify ( sqrt{7 - 4sqrt{3}} ). Maybe it can be expressed as ( sqrt{a} - sqrt{b} ) or something similar.Let me assume ( sqrt{7 - 4sqrt{3}} = sqrt{a} - sqrt{b} ). Then, squaring both sides:[7 - 4sqrt{3} = a + b - 2sqrt{ab}]Comparing the terms, we have:[a + b = 7 -2sqrt{ab} = -4sqrt{3}]From the second equation:[2sqrt{ab} = 4sqrt{3} Rightarrow sqrt{ab} = 2sqrt{3} Rightarrow ab = 12]So, we have:[a + b = 7 ab = 12]We need two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) such that their sum is 7 and product is 12. Let's see, factors of 12: 3 and 4. 3 + 4 = 7. Perfect.So, ( a = 4 ), ( b = 3 ). Therefore:[sqrt{7 - 4sqrt{3}} = sqrt{4} - sqrt{3} = 2 - sqrt{3}]Wait, let me check:[(2 - sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 4sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 - 4sqrt{3}]Yes, that's correct. So, ( |PA| = 2 - sqrt{3} ).Wait, hold on. The square root of a positive number is positive, so ( |PA| ) must be positive. Since ( 2 - sqrt{3} ) is approximately ( 2 - 1.732 = 0.267 ), which is positive, so that's fine.Now, let's compute ( |PB| ).Coordinates of ( B ): ( left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right) )Coordinates of ( P ): ( (1, 0) )Distance formula:[|PB| = sqrt{ left( 1 - left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) right)^2 + left( 0 - left( frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right) right)^2 }]Simplify each component:First component (x-direction):[1 - left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) = 1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{2 + sqrt{3}}{2}]Second component (y-direction):[0 - left( frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right) = -frac{3}{2} - sqrt{3}]So, plug into the distance formula:[|PB| = sqrt{ left( frac{2 + sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 + left( -frac{3}{2} - sqrt{3} right)^2 }]Compute each square:First square:[left( frac{2 + sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 = frac{(2 + sqrt{3})^2}{4} = frac{4 + 4sqrt{3} + 3}{4} = frac{7 + 4sqrt{3}}{4}]Second square:[left( -frac{3}{2} - sqrt{3} right)^2 = left( frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right)^2 = left( frac{3}{2} right)^2 + 2 times frac{3}{2} times sqrt{3} + (sqrt{3})^2 = frac{9}{4} + 3sqrt{3} + 3 = frac{9}{4} + 3 + 3sqrt{3} = frac{21}{4} + 3sqrt{3}]So, adding both squares:[frac{7 + 4sqrt{3}}{4} + frac{21}{4} + 3sqrt{3} = frac{7 + 4sqrt{3} + 21}{4} + 3sqrt{3} = frac{28 + 4sqrt{3}}{4} + 3sqrt{3} = 7 + sqrt{3} + 3sqrt{3} = 7 + 4sqrt{3}]Therefore, ( |PB| = sqrt{7 + 4sqrt{3}} ).Again, let's see if this can be simplified. Assume ( sqrt{7 + 4sqrt{3}} = sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} ). Squaring both sides:[7 + 4sqrt{3} = a + b + 2sqrt{ab}]Comparing terms:[a + b = 7 2sqrt{ab} = 4sqrt{3} Rightarrow sqrt{ab} = 2sqrt{3} Rightarrow ab = 12]Same as before, so ( a = 4 ), ( b = 3 ). Therefore:[sqrt{7 + 4sqrt{3}} = sqrt{4} + sqrt{3} = 2 + sqrt{3}]Check:[(2 + sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4sqrt{3}]Yes, correct. So, ( |PB| = 2 + sqrt{3} ).Now, we need to compute ( |PA| + |PB| ):[|PA| + |PB| = (2 - sqrt{3}) + (2 + sqrt{3}) = 4]Wait, that's nice! The ( sqrt{3} ) terms cancel out, leaving 4. So, the value is 4.Alternatively, I could have thought about this problem in terms of power of a point or something else, but since I went through the explicit calculation, I think 4 is the correct answer.But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this without computing all the distances.I remember that for a point outside a circle, the sum of the distances from the point to the intersection points of a line through the point with the circle can sometimes be related to the power of the point or something else. But I don't recall a direct formula for the sum of distances. However, in this case, since the line passes through the circle, and the point is outside, the distances PA and PB can be considered as the lengths from P to A and P to B.But in this case, since I computed them explicitly and they summed up to 4, which is a nice integer, I think that's correct.Alternatively, maybe using parametric equations to find t-values and compute the distances. Let me try that approach as a cross-check.Given the parametric equations of line ( l ):[x = 1 - frac{1}{2} t y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} t]We can substitute these into the circle equation:[x^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3]Substituting:[left( 1 - frac{1}{2} t right)^2 + left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} t - sqrt{3} right)^2 = 3]Let me compute each term.First term:[left( 1 - frac{1}{2} t right)^2 = 1 - t + frac{1}{4} t^2]Second term:[left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} t - sqrt{3} right)^2 = left( sqrt{3} left( frac{t}{2} - 1 right) right)^2 = 3 left( frac{t}{2} - 1 right)^2 = 3 left( frac{t^2}{4} - t + 1 right) = frac{3 t^2}{4} - 3 t + 3]Adding both terms:[1 - t + frac{1}{4} t^2 + frac{3 t^2}{4} - 3 t + 3 = 3]Combine like terms:- ( t^2 ) terms: ( frac{1}{4} t^2 + frac{3}{4} t^2 = t^2 )- ( t ) terms: ( -t - 3t = -4t )- Constants: ( 1 + 3 = 4 )So, equation becomes:[t^2 - 4t + 4 = 3 Rightarrow t^2 - 4t + 1 = 0]Solving this quadratic equation:[t = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{3}]So, the parameter ( t ) at points ( A ) and ( B ) are ( t = 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( t = 2 - sqrt{3} ).Now, let's find the coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ) using these ( t )-values.For ( t = 2 + sqrt{3} ):[x = 1 - frac{1}{2}(2 + sqrt{3}) = 1 - 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(2 + sqrt{3}) = sqrt{3} + frac{3}{2}]So, point ( A ) is ( left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, sqrt{3} + frac{3}{2} right) ). Wait, but earlier I had point ( A ) as ( left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, -frac{3}{2} + sqrt{3} right) ). Hmm, seems like a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I mixed up points ( A ) and ( B ). Let me check.Wait, when ( t = 2 + sqrt{3} ), x is negative, so that's point ( B ). When ( t = 2 - sqrt{3} ), which is approximately ( 2 - 1.732 = 0.267 ), positive, so x is positive, which is point ( A ).So, for ( t = 2 - sqrt{3} ):[x = 1 - frac{1}{2}(2 - sqrt{3}) = 1 - 1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(2 - sqrt{3}) = sqrt{3} - frac{3}{2}]So, point ( A ) is ( left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, sqrt{3} - frac{3}{2} right) ), which matches my previous result.Now, with these ( t )-values, can I compute ( |PA| + |PB| ) without computing the coordinates?Point ( P ) is at ( (1, 0) ). The parametric equations of line ( l ) are given with parameter ( t ). So, the distance from ( P ) to a general point on line ( l ) can be expressed in terms of ( t ).Let me denote a general point on line ( l ) as ( (x(t), y(t)) ). Then, the distance from ( P(1, 0) ) to ( (x(t), y(t)) ) is:[|PP(t)| = sqrt{(x(t) - 1)^2 + (y(t) - 0)^2}]Substitute ( x(t) = 1 - frac{1}{2} t ) and ( y(t) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} t ):[|PP(t)| = sqrt{ left(1 - frac{1}{2} t - 1 right)^2 + left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} t right)^2 } = sqrt{ left( -frac{1}{2} t right)^2 + left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} t right)^2 } = sqrt{ frac{1}{4} t^2 + frac{3}{4} t^2 } = sqrt{ t^2 } = |t|]Wait, that's interesting! So, the distance from ( P ) to any point on line ( l ) is simply ( |t| ). That's a huge simplification.Therefore, for points ( A ) and ( B ), which correspond to ( t = 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( t = 2 - sqrt{3} ), the distances ( |PA| ) and ( |PB| ) are ( |2 + sqrt{3}| ) and ( |2 - sqrt{3}| ), respectively.Since both ( 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( 2 - sqrt{3} ) are positive (as ( sqrt{3} approx 1.732 < 2 )), we can drop the absolute value signs:[|PA| = 2 + sqrt{3} |PB| = 2 - sqrt{3}]Therefore, ( |PA| + |PB| = (2 + sqrt{3}) + (2 - sqrt{3}) = 4 ).Wow, that was much simpler! I should have thought of that earlier. Using the parametric form and realizing that the distance from ( P ) to a point on ( l ) is just ( |t| ) is a clever shortcut. It avoids all the messy coordinate calculations and directly gives the distances.So, regardless of the method, the answer is 4. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.Just to recap, part (Ⅰ) was about converting parametric and polar equations to Cartesian, which I did step by step. Part (Ⅱ) required finding the sum of distances from a point to two intersection points, which I first did by finding coordinates and then realized a smarter way using the parameter ( t ).I think I'm confident with the results. The key takeaway is recognizing that in the parametric equation, the parameter ( t ) can directly relate to the distance from a specific point, which in this case was ( P(1, 0) ). That's a useful insight for future problems.**Final Answer**Ⅰ. The standard equation of line ( l ) is ( y = -sqrt{3}x + sqrt{3} ) and the Cartesian equation of circle ( C ) is ( x^2 + (y - sqrt{3})^2 = 3 ).Ⅱ. The value of ( |PA| + |PB| ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"At a nursery, 2006 babies sit in a circle. Suddenly each baby pokes the baby immediately to either its left or its right, with equal probability. What is the expected number of unpoked babies?","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here: there are 2006 babies sitting in a circle, and each baby pokes either the baby to their left or right with equal probability. I need to find the expected number of unpoked babies. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the scenario. Imagine a circle of 2006 babies. Each baby has two neighbors: one on the left and one on the right. Each baby independently decides to poke either their left neighbor or their right neighbor, each with a 50% chance. So, for each baby, there's a 50% chance they'll poke left and a 50% chance they'll poke right.Now, the question is about the expected number of babies who aren't poked by anyone. So, an unpoked baby is one who isn't poked by either of their neighbors. That means both the baby to their left doesn't poke them, and the baby to their right doesn't poke them either.Hmm, okay. So, for any given baby, the probability that they are not poked by their left neighbor is 0.5, because the left neighbor has a 50% chance to poke them or not. Similarly, the probability that they are not poked by their right neighbor is also 0.5. Since these two events are independent, the probability that both don't poke them is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. So, each baby has a 25% chance of being unpoked.Wait, hold on. Is that right? So, if each baby has a 25% chance of being unpoked, then the expected number of unpoked babies would be 2006 * 0.25, which is 501.5. But wait, 501.5 is not an integer, and the number of babies should be an integer. Hmm, but expectation doesn't have to be an integer, right? It's just the average outcome. So, maybe that's okay.But let me think again. Is the probability for each baby being unpoked actually 0.25? Because each baby's poking is independent, but the events of being poked by left and right neighbors are not entirely independent because the neighbors are also part of the same circle. Wait, no, actually, each baby's action is independent, so the probability that a baby is not poked by their left neighbor is 0.5, and similarly for the right neighbor. So, since the two events are independent, the combined probability is 0.25.But wait, hold on another second. Is the action of the left neighbor and the right neighbor independent? Let me clarify. Each baby independently decides to poke left or right, so the left neighbor's action doesn't affect the right neighbor's action. Therefore, the two events (left neighbor not poking me and right neighbor not poking me) are independent. So, the probability that both don't poke me is indeed 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.So, if each baby has a 0.25 probability of being unpoked, then the expected number of unpoked babies is 2006 * 0.25. Let me compute that: 2006 divided by 4 is 501.5. So, 501.5 is the expected number. But since we can't have half a baby, but expectation is a continuous measure, so it's okay.But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because sometimes in circular arrangements, dependencies can affect the probabilities, but in this case, each baby's poking is independent, so the expectation should still hold.Alternatively, maybe I can model this using linearity of expectation. Linearity of expectation says that the expected value of the sum is the sum of the expected values, regardless of dependencies. So, even if the events are dependent, the expectation can still be calculated by summing the individual expectations.So, let me define an indicator variable X_i for each baby i, where X_i = 1 if baby i is unpoked, and X_i = 0 otherwise. Then, the expected number of unpoked babies is E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_2006] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_2006}.Each E[X_i] is just the probability that baby i is unpoked, which we thought was 0.25. So, the total expectation is 2006 * 0.25 = 501.5.Wait, but let me think again. Is the probability for each baby being unpoked actually 0.25? Because in a circle, each baby is both a potential pocker and a potential pokee. So, maybe there's some overlap or dependency that I'm not considering.But no, actually, the actions are independent. Each baby independently decides to poke left or right, so the probability that a specific baby is not poked by their left neighbor is 0.5, and similarly for the right neighbor. So, the combined probability is 0.25, regardless of the circular arrangement.Wait, but let me test this with a smaller number of babies to see if it holds. Let's say there are 2 babies in a circle. Each baby pokes either left or right. So, baby 1 can poke baby 2 or baby 2 can poke baby 1. Wait, in this case, each baby has only one neighbor on each side, but since it's a circle, each baby has two neighbors, but in the case of 2 babies, each baby's left and right neighbor is the same baby.Wait, hold on, that might complicate things. Let me try with 3 babies instead.So, 3 babies in a circle: A, B, C. Each baby can poke left or right. Let's compute the expected number of unpoked babies.First, for each baby, the probability that they are not poked by their left neighbor and not poked by their right neighbor.For baby A: the left neighbor is C, and the right neighbor is B. The probability that C doesn't poke A is 0.5, and the probability that B doesn't poke A is 0.5. So, the probability that A is unpoked is 0.25.Similarly, for baby B: left neighbor is A, right neighbor is C. So, probability of not being poked by A is 0.5, and not being poked by C is 0.5. So, 0.25.Same for baby C: 0.25.So, the expected number of unpoked babies is 3 * 0.25 = 0.75.But let's compute it manually to verify.Each baby has two choices: poke left or right. So, for 3 babies, there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations.Let's list all possibilities:1. A pokes left (C), B pokes left (A), C pokes left (B)   - A pokes C, B pokes A, C pokes B   - Who is poked?     - C is poked by A     - A is poked by B     - B is poked by C   - So, all babies are poked. Unpoked babies: 02. A pokes left (C), B pokes left (A), C pokes right (A)   - A pokes C, B pokes A, C pokes A   - Who is poked?     - C is poked by A     - A is poked by B and C     - B is not poked   - Unpoked babies: B3. A pokes left (C), B pokes right (C), C pokes left (B)   - A pokes C, B pokes C, C pokes B   - Who is poked?     - C is poked by A and B     - B is poked by C     - A is not poked   - Unpoked babies: A4. A pokes left (C), B pokes right (C), C pokes right (A)   - A pokes C, B pokes C, C pokes A   - Who is poked?     - C is poked by A and B     - A is poked by C     - B is not poked   - Unpoked babies: B5. A pokes right (B), B pokes left (A), C pokes left (B)   - A pokes B, B pokes A, C pokes B   - Who is poked?     - B is poked by A and C     - A is poked by B     - C is not poked   - Unpoked babies: C6. A pokes right (B), B pokes left (A), C pokes right (A)   - A pokes B, B pokes A, C pokes A   - Who is poked?     - B is poked by A     - A is poked by B and C     - C is not poked   - Unpoked babies: C7. A pokes right (B), B pokes right (C), C pokes left (B)   - A pokes B, B pokes C, C pokes B   - Who is poked?     - B is poked by A and C     - C is poked by B     - A is not poked   - Unpoked babies: A8. A pokes right (B), B pokes right (C), C pokes right (A)   - A pokes B, B pokes C, C pokes A   - Who is poked?     - B is poked by A     - C is poked by B     - A is poked by C   - All babies are poked. Unpoked babies: 0Now, let's count the number of unpoked babies in each case:1. 02. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 0So, total unpoked babies across all 8 cases: 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6Average number of unpoked babies: 6 / 8 = 0.75Which is exactly 3 * 0.25 = 0.75. So, the calculation holds for n=3.Similarly, if I test with n=2, let's see:2 babies, A and B. Each can poke left or right.But in a circle of 2, each baby has two neighbors, but both are the same baby. So, for baby A, left neighbor is B, right neighbor is B. Similarly for baby B.Wait, so each baby has two neighbors, but in this case, both are the same. So, if baby A pokes left, it pokes B, and pokes right, it also pokes B. Similarly for baby B.So, in this case, each baby has only one unique neighbor, but they have two directions to poke.Wait, so let's see:Each baby can poke left or right, but both directions point to the same baby.So, for baby A, poking left is poking B, poking right is also poking B.Similarly, for baby B, poking left is poking A, poking right is poking A.So, in this case, each baby has two choices, but both choices result in poking the same baby.So, the possible configurations:1. A pokes left (B), B pokes left (A)   - A pokes B, B pokes A   - Both are poked. Unpoked babies: 02. A pokes left (B), B pokes right (A)   - A pokes B, B pokes A   - Both are poked. Unpoked babies: 03. A pokes right (B), B pokes left (A)   - A pokes B, B pokes A   - Both are poked. Unpoked babies: 04. A pokes right (B), B pokes right (A)   - A pokes B, B pokes A   - Both are poked. Unpoked babies: 0Wait, so in all cases, both babies are poked. So, the number of unpoked babies is always 0.But according to our previous formula, n=2, expected unpoked babies would be 2 * 0.25 = 0.5. But in reality, it's always 0.Hmm, that's a problem. So, our initial approach might be flawed for n=2.Wait, why is that? Because in n=2, each baby has only one unique neighbor, but two directions. So, if a baby pokes left or right, it's always poking the same baby. So, in this case, each baby is poked by both neighbors, because each neighbor has two chances to poke them.Wait, hold on. Let's think again.In the case of n=2, each baby has two neighbors, but both are the same baby. So, for baby A, the left neighbor is B, and the right neighbor is B. Similarly for baby B.So, the probability that baby A is not poked by B is the probability that B does not poke A. But B has two choices: poke left or poke right, both of which are A. So, regardless of B's choice, B pokes A. Therefore, baby A is always poked by B. Similarly, baby B is always poked by A.Therefore, in n=2, all babies are always poked. So, the expected number of unpoked babies is 0.But according to our initial formula, it's 2 * 0.25 = 0.5, which is incorrect.So, that suggests that our initial approach is wrong for n=2. Hmm, so what's the issue here?Wait, maybe the problem is that in n=2, each baby has two neighbors, but both are the same, so the events of being poked by left and right are not independent, but actually the same event. So, in n=2, the probability that a baby is not poked by their left neighbor is 0.5, but the probability that they are not poked by their right neighbor is also 0.5, but these two events are not independent because both are determined by the same baby's choice.Wait, no, in n=2, each baby has two neighbors, but both are the same baby. So, for baby A, the left neighbor is B, and the right neighbor is B. So, the probability that A is not poked by B is the probability that B does not poke A. But B has two choices: poke left (A) or poke right (A). So, regardless of B's choice, B pokes A. Therefore, the probability that A is not poked by B is 0.Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, if B pokes left, it pokes A, and if B pokes right, it pokes A. So, B always pokes A, so the probability that A is not poked by B is 0. Similarly, the probability that A is not poked by B is 0. So, the probability that A is not poked by both neighbors is 0 * 0 = 0.Therefore, in n=2, each baby is always poked, so the expected number of unpoked babies is 0.But in our initial approach, we considered the probability of not being poked by left and right neighbors as independent, each with probability 0.5, so 0.25. But in reality, for n=2, the two events are not independent; they are the same event, so the probability is 0.Therefore, our initial approach is incorrect for n=2. So, perhaps our initial approach is only valid for n >=3?Wait, but in n=3, it worked. So, maybe for n >=3, the initial approach is correct, but for n=2, it's different.But in our problem, n=2006, which is a large number, so maybe the initial approach is still valid.Wait, but let me think again. In n=2006, each baby has two distinct neighbors, left and right. So, the probability that a baby is not poked by their left neighbor is 0.5, and the probability that they are not poked by their right neighbor is 0.5, and these two events are independent because the left and right neighbors are different babies, each making independent choices.Therefore, in n=2006, the probability that a baby is not poked by either neighbor is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, so the expected number is 2006 * 0.25 = 501.5.But in n=2, the two neighbors are the same baby, so the two events are not independent, and the probability is 0.So, perhaps for n >=3, the initial approach is correct, but for n=2, it's different.Therefore, in our problem, since n=2006, which is much larger than 3, the initial approach is valid, and the expected number of unpoked babies is 501.5.But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to model this?Alternatively, perhaps we can model the number of unpoked babies as the number of fixed points in a permutation, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.Wait, another approach: For each baby, define the event that they are not poked by their left neighbor and not poked by their right neighbor. Then, the expected number is the sum over all babies of the probability of each such event.Since each baby's left and right neighbors are independent, the probability that both don't poke them is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, as before.Therefore, the expected number is 2006 * 0.25 = 501.5.But let me think about dependencies. Even though the events are dependent (because if one baby is unpoked, it affects the probability of their neighbors being unpoked), the linearity of expectation still holds regardless of dependencies.So, even though the events are not independent, the expectation can still be calculated as the sum of individual expectations.Therefore, the expected number is indeed 501.5.But wait, let me think about another angle. Maybe using the concept of derangements or something similar.Wait, no, derangements are about permutations where no element appears in its original position, which is a different problem.Alternatively, perhaps we can model the poking as a directed graph, where each baby points to either their left or right neighbor. Then, an unpoked baby is a node with in-degree 0.So, in this directed graph, each node has out-degree 1, since each baby pokes exactly one neighbor. The in-degree of each node is the number of babies poking them, which can be 0, 1, or 2.We are to find the expected number of nodes with in-degree 0.In such a graph, the expected number of nodes with in-degree 0 can be calculated as n * P(in-degree = 0).And as we calculated earlier, P(in-degree = 0) = 0.25, so the expectation is 2006 * 0.25 = 501.5.Alternatively, we can think of the entire process as each edge (from a baby to their left or right neighbor) being present with probability 0.5. Then, the in-degree of each node is the sum of two independent Bernoulli random variables, each with probability 0.5. So, the probability that the in-degree is 0 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25.Therefore, the expected number is n * 0.25.So, all these approaches lead to the same result.But just to make sure, let me think about another small case, say n=4.For n=4, let's compute the expected number of unpoked babies.Using our formula, it should be 4 * 0.25 = 1.But let's compute it manually.Each baby can poke left or right, so 2^4 = 16 configurations.But this might take a while, but let me try a few.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the probability for a specific baby being unpoked, which should be 0.25, so the expectation is 1.Alternatively, since the linearity of expectation holds, regardless of dependencies, the expectation should be 1.But let me try to compute it for n=4.Wait, maybe it's too time-consuming, but I can think that for each baby, the probability of being unpoked is 0.25, so the expectation is 1.Therefore, for n=4, the expected number is 1.Alternatively, let me think about the variance or something, but that's not necessary here.So, in conclusion, for n=2006, the expected number of unpoked babies is 2006 * 0.25 = 501.5.But the problem is asking for the expected number, so 501.5 is acceptable, even though it's a fractional number.But wait, 501.5 is equal to 1003/2, so maybe we can write it as a fraction.But in the problem statement, it's just asking for the expected number, so 501.5 is fine.Alternatively, since 2006 divided by 4 is 501.5, that's correct.Therefore, the expected number of unpoked babies is 501.5.But wait, let me check once more.Each baby has two neighbors, each with a 50% chance of poking them. So, the probability that a baby is not poked by either neighbor is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Therefore, the expected number is n * 0.25.Yes, that seems correct.So, I think I've thought through this problem thoroughly, checked it with smaller cases, and each time the logic holds. So, I'm confident that the expected number of unpoked babies is 501.5.**Final Answer**The expected number of unpoked babies is boxed{501.5}."},{"question":"What is the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors?","answer":"To determine the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors, I start by understanding the relationship between a number's prime factorization and its number of factors.A positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime factors raised to their respective exponents. For example, a number ( N ) can be written as ( N = p_1^{a_1} times p_2^{a_2} times dots times p_k^{a_k} ), where ( p_1, p_2, dots, p_k ) are distinct prime numbers and ( a_1, a_2, dots, a_k ) are their corresponding exponents.The total number of distinct positive factors of ( N ) is given by multiplying one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization. This is expressed as:[text{Number of factors} = (a_1 + 1) times (a_2 + 1) times dots times (a_k + 1)]Given that we need exactly five factors, I set up the equation:[(a_1 + 1) times (a_2 + 1) times dots times (a_k + 1) = 5]Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express it as a product of integers greater than 1 is ( 5 = 5 times 1 ). This implies that the number must have a single prime factor raised to the 4th power, as ( a_1 + 1 = 5 ) leads to ( a_1 = 4 ).Therefore, the smallest such number is ( 2^4 = 16 ). The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, which confirms that it has exactly five distinct positive factors."},{"question":"Bill thought he bought 70 chihuahuas, but some of them turned out to be rats. If the number of rats was 6 times the number of chihuahuas, how many rats did he buy?","answer":"First, I'll define the variables. Let ( C ) represent the number of chihuahuas and ( R ) represent the number of rats.According to the problem, Bill thought he bought 70 chihuahuas, but some of them turned out to be rats.

This gives us the second equation:[ R = 6C ]Now, I'll substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for ( C ):[ C + 6C = 70 ][ 7C = 70 ][ C = 10 ]With the value of ( C ), I can find ( R ) using the second equation:[ R = 6 times 10 = 60 ]Therefore, Bill bought 60 rats."},{"question":"Mom asks Xiao Ming to boil water and make tea for guests.

The hobbit Bilbo knows all the gnomes, but he cannot see how they are seated as his eyes are covered. Bilbo can name two any gnomes, and all the gnomes will chorus in response, telling him how many gnomes are sitting between these two gnomes (along the shortest arc). Can Bilbo find out at least one pair of adjacent sitting gnomes by asking no more than 50 questions?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about 99 gnomes sitting around a round table. Bilbo, the hobbit, knows all the gnomes but can't see how they're seated because his eyes are covered. He can name any two gnomes, and all the gnomes will chorus back, telling him how many are sitting between those two along the shortest arc. The question is, can Bilbo figure out at least one pair of adjacent gnomes by asking no more than 50 questions?Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. First, the setup: 99 gnomes in a circle. Bilbo can't see them, but he can query pairs and get the number of gnomes between them. So, if he asks about two gnomes, the response will be a number between 0 and 49, since the table is round and the shortest arc can't be more than half the table. For 99 gnomes, half is 49.5, so they probably round down to 49.So, the goal is to find at least one pair of adjacent gnomes. That means two gnomes with exactly one gnome between them, right? Because in a circle, adjacency would mean the minimal distance. So, if two gnomes are adjacent, the number of gnomes between them is 0, but wait, no. Wait, if you have two gnomes sitting next to each other, the number of gnomes between them is zero, but actually, no—wait, if they're adjacent, the number of seats between them is one? Wait, no, hold on.Wait, let me clarify. If two gnomes are sitting next to each other, how many gnomes are between them? If they're adjacent, there are zero gnomes between them. Because they're sitting right next to each other. So, if Bilbo asks about two adjacent gnomes, the response would be 0. But if he asks about two gnomes with one gnome between them, the response would be 1, and so on.Wait, but hold on. If you have two gnomes, the number of gnomes between them is the count of gnomes along the shortest arc. So, if they're adjacent, the number is 0. If they have one gnome between them, it's 1, and so on up to 49, since beyond that, the other arc would be shorter.So, the key is that Bilbo wants to find a pair with 0 gnomes between them, i.e., adjacent. So, the question is, can he do this with 50 questions?I think the answer is yes, but I need to figure out how.So, let's think about strategies. One approach is to model this as a graph problem. Each gnome is a node, and each question is an edge with a weight equal to the number of gnomes between them. So, the graph is a circular graph with 99 nodes, and each edge has a weight between 0 and 49.But wait, actually, the graph isn't just a simple circular graph because Bilbo is querying arbitrary pairs, not just adjacent ones. So, the graph is more like a complete graph where each edge has a weight corresponding to the number of gnomes between them.But how does this help? Maybe we can model the problem as trying to find an edge with weight 0.But how can Bilbo efficiently find such an edge with only 50 questions?Alternatively, maybe we can think in terms of information theory. Each question gives Bilbo some information about the seating arrangement. How much information does each question give?Each question can result in 50 possible answers (0 to 49). So, each question gives log2(50) ≈ 5.64 bits of information. But the total number of possible seating arrangements is (99-1)! = 98! due to circular permutations. The logarithm of that is enormous, so information-theoretically, 50 questions are nowhere near enough to determine the entire arrangement. But we don't need the entire arrangement, just at least one adjacent pair.So, maybe it's possible with fewer questions because we don't need complete information.Another approach: think about the problem probabilistically. If Bilbo randomly picks pairs, what's the chance he finds an adjacent pair? There are 99 gnomes, so 99 adjacent pairs. The total number of possible pairs is C(99,2) = 4851. So, the probability of randomly selecting an adjacent pair is 99/4851 ≈ 0.0204, or about 2%. So, if he asks 50 questions randomly, the expected number of adjacent pairs he finds is 50 * 0.0204 ≈ 1.02. So, on average, he might find one adjacent pair. But this is probabilistic, and the problem is asking if he can guarantee finding one with 50 questions, not just probabilistically.So, we need a deterministic strategy.Wait, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node is connected to others with edges labeled by the distance. If we can find a Hamiltonian cycle, but that's probably not helpful.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of a spanning tree. If Bilbo can construct a spanning tree with certain properties, he might be able to deduce adjacency.Wait, another idea: suppose Bilbo fixes one gnome, say G1, and then queries G1 with every other gnome. That would take 98 questions, which is more than 50, so that's not feasible.Alternatively, perhaps he can use a divide and conquer approach. Since the table is circular, maybe he can partition the gnomes into groups and narrow down the possible adjacents.Wait, let's think about the distances. Each distance corresponds to a chord in the circle. If Bilbo can find two gnomes with distance 1, that would mean they are adjacent. But how?Alternatively, think about the problem as trying to find a pair with distance 0. So, if he can find such a pair, he's done.Wait, but the problem is that Bilbo doesn't know the seating arrangement, so he can't target specific pairs. He needs a systematic way.Wait, here's an idea: use the concept of a \\"distance matrix.\\" If Bilbo can construct a distance matrix, he can look for zeros, which indicate adjacency. But constructing a full distance matrix would require C(99,2) questions, which is way too many.But maybe he doesn't need the full matrix. Maybe he can find a way to identify an adjacent pair with fewer questions.Wait, another approach: consider that in a circle, the distance between two gnomes is the minimum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise counts. So, if Bilbo can somehow triangulate the position of a gnome relative to others, he might be able to find an adjacent pair.Alternatively, think about it as a graph where each node has degree 2 (each gnome has two neighbors). So, the graph is a cycle. If Bilbo can find any edge of this cycle, he's found an adjacent pair.But how can he do that with only 50 questions?Wait, here's a thought: if Bilbo can find a gnome that has a distance of 1 from another, that would mean they are adjacent. But how can he ensure that?Alternatively, perhaps he can use a strategy where he selects a gnome, say G1, and then queries G1 with other gnomes, keeping track of the distances. If he finds two gnomes that are both at distance 1 from G1, then those two would be adjacent to each other. Wait, no, because G1 is between them, so the distance between them would be 2.Wait, let me clarify. If G1 is adjacent to G2 and G3, then G2 and G3 would be two seats apart from each other, right? Because G1 is between them. So, the distance between G2 and G3 would be 2.So, if Bilbo queries G2 and G3, he would get a distance of 2, not 0. So, that doesn't help.Alternatively, if he queries G1 with G2, he gets distance 0 (if they are adjacent) or 1, etc. Wait, no, if G1 and G2 are adjacent, the distance is 0. If they have one gnome between them, the distance is 1, etc.Wait, no, correction: If G1 and G2 are adjacent, the number of gnomes between them is 0. If they have one gnome between them, the number is 1, and so on.So, if Bilbo queries G1 and G2, and gets 0, he knows they are adjacent. If he gets 1, they have one gnome between them, etc.So, if he can find a pair with distance 0, he's done.But how can he do this systematically?Wait, here's an idea inspired by the concept of a \\"doubling\\" strategy. Suppose Bilbo starts by querying pairs in a way that each subsequent query can potentially halve the search space.But I'm not sure how to apply that here.Alternatively, think about it as a problem of finding a zero in a circular array. Each query gives the value at a certain position. But it's not exactly the same.Wait, another approach: consider that in a circle of 99 gnomes, each gnome has two neighbors. So, there are 99 edges (adjacent pairs). If Bilbo can find any of these edges, he's done.So, the problem reduces to finding at least one edge in a hidden graph with 99 nodes and 99 edges (a cycle). Each query reveals the distance between two nodes, which is the minimal number of edges between them.But how can he find an edge with 50 queries?Wait, here's a strategy: use the concept of a \\"distance oracle.\\" If Bilbo can fix a starting point and then perform a binary search around the circle, he might be able to locate an adjacent pair.But without knowing the direction, it's tricky.Wait, perhaps he can fix a gnome, say G1, and then query G1 with other gnomes in a way that allows him to determine the positions of others relative to G1.But again, with only 50 questions, he can't query G1 with all others.Wait, another idea: use the pigeonhole principle. If Bilbo makes 50 queries, each potentially giving a distance, perhaps he can find two queries that are adjacent.But how?Wait, suppose he queries 50 pairs. Each pair has a distance between 0 and 49. If he can arrange the queries such that at least two of them are adjacent, then he can find an adjacent pair.But how can he ensure that?Wait, maybe not. Because the 50 pairs could all be non-adjacent.Wait, but there are 99 gnomes, so 99 seats. If he queries 50 pairs, each pair can be thought of as covering two seats. So, 50 pairs cover 100 seats, but since there are only 99, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one seat is covered twice. But that doesn't necessarily mean that two pairs share a common gnome, but even if they do, it doesn't guarantee that the shared gnome is adjacent to someone.Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.Wait, another angle: think of the problem as trying to find a pair with distance 0. So, if Bilbo can find any pair with distance 0, he's done. So, the question is, can he design 50 queries such that at least one of them is a pair with distance 0.But how can he ensure that? Because he doesn't know where the adjacent pairs are.Wait, maybe he can use a strategy where he queries pairs in such a way that every possible adjacent pair is covered in his queries. But with 50 queries, he can only cover 50 pairs, but there are 99 adjacent pairs. So, unless he can cover all 99 with 50 queries, which is impossible, he can't guarantee it.Wait, but perhaps he can use overlapping queries to cover multiple adjacent pairs.Wait, for example, if he queries G1-G2, G2-G3, G3-G4, etc., but he doesn't know the order, so he can't do that.Wait, no, because he doesn't know the seating order, so he can't sequentially query adjacent pairs.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a graph where each node is connected to others with edges labeled by the distance. If he can find a triangle where two edges have distance 1, then the third edge would have distance 2, but that might not help.Alternatively, think about it as a system of equations. Each query gives an equation about the distance between two nodes. If he can set up enough equations, he can solve for the positions.But with 50 equations, it's still not enough to solve for 99 variables.Wait, perhaps another way: use the concept of a \\"distance labeling.\\" If Bilbo can assign labels to gnomes based on their distances from a fixed point, he might be able to reconstruct the circle.But again, without knowing the starting point, it's difficult.Wait, here's a different idea: use the fact that in a circle, the distances between gnomes have certain properties. For example, if two gnomes are k apart, then the distance between them is k or 99 - k, whichever is smaller.But since the responses are the minimal distance, it's always k if k <= 49.Wait, so if Bilbo can find two gnomes with distance 1, that would mean they are adjacent. So, how can he find such a pair?Wait, perhaps he can use a strategy where he selects a gnome, say G1, and then queries G1 with other gnomes, keeping track of the distances. If he finds a gnome G2 such that the distance between G1 and G2 is 1, then he's found an adjacent pair. But if not, he can move on.But with 50 questions, he can only query 50 pairs. If he queries G1 with 50 other gnomes, he might find an adjacent pair if one of those 50 is adjacent to G1. But there are only two gnomes adjacent to G1, so the chance is low.Wait, but he can do better. Instead of fixing G1, he can vary his queries to cover more potential adjacents.Wait, here's a strategy inspired by the \\"20 questions\\" game. If Bilbo can perform a binary search around the circle, he can potentially locate an adjacent pair.But how?Wait, suppose he starts by querying two gnomes, say G1 and G2. If the distance is d, then he knows they are d apart. Then, he can query G1 and G3, and so on, effectively performing a binary search to find the minimal distance.But without knowing the direction, it's tricky.Wait, another idea: use the concept of a \\"doubling\\" strategy. Start by querying pairs that are 1 apart, then 2, then 4, etc., effectively covering the circle in log steps.But I'm not sure.Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that in a circle of 99 gnomes, the number of possible distances is 50 (0 to 49). So, if Bilbo makes 50 queries, each potentially giving a unique distance, he might be able to cover all possible distances, but that doesn't directly help.Wait, but if he can find two gnomes with distance 0, he's done. So, perhaps he can design his queries to cover all possible pairs that could be adjacent.But there are 99 adjacent pairs, so he can't cover all with 50 queries.Wait, but maybe he can use a strategy where each query has a high probability of hitting an adjacent pair, but since we need a guarantee, probability isn't enough.Wait, another angle: think of the problem as a graph where each node has two edges (adjacent pairs). So, the graph is a cycle. If Bilbo can find any edge, he's done. So, the problem reduces to finding an edge in a cycle graph with 99 nodes, using 50 queries.But how?Wait, here's a possible strategy: use the fact that in a cycle, the sum of distances around the cycle is 99. So, if Bilbo can find a set of distances that add up to 99, he can find a cycle, but I'm not sure how that helps.Wait, another idea: use the concept of a \\"distance matrix\\" and look for triangles where the sum of two sides equals the third. But without knowing the actual distances, it's hard.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a graph where each node is connected to others with edges labeled by the distance. If Bilbo can find a triangle where two edges have distance 1, then the third edge would have distance 2, but that doesn't directly help.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think simpler.If Bilbo can ask 50 questions, each time asking about a pair of gnomes. If he can arrange his questions such that every possible adjacent pair is included in at least one of his questions, then he can guarantee finding an adjacent pair. But there are 99 adjacent pairs, so he can't cover all with 50 questions.But wait, maybe he can cover all possible adjacent pairs by overlapping his queries. For example, if he queries G1-G2, G2-G3, ..., G50-G51, that's 50 queries, covering 51 gnomes. But there are 99 gnomes, so he's missing 48. So, he hasn't covered all adjacent pairs.Alternatively, if he queries non-consecutive pairs, but that might not help.Wait, perhaps a better strategy is to use the fact that in a circle, the number of edges is equal to the number of nodes. So, 99 edges. If Bilbo can find a way to cover all edges with 50 queries, but that's not possible.Wait, another idea: use the concept of a \\"matching.\\" A matching is a set of edges without common vertices. If Bilbo can find a matching that covers all nodes, but with 99 nodes, a matching can cover at most 49 pairs, leaving one node uncovered. But that doesn't help directly.Wait, perhaps he can use a strategy where he queries pairs in such a way that each query potentially reveals information about multiple possible adjacents.Wait, here's a thought: if Bilbo queries a pair and gets a distance d, then he knows that the two gnomes are d apart. If he can find another pair that shares a gnome and has a distance of d+1 or d-1, he might be able to triangulate the position.But this seems too vague.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that with 50 queries, Bilbo can potentially cover 100 gnome positions (since each query involves two gnomes). But there are only 99 gnomes, so by the pigeonhole principle, at least one gnome is involved in two queries. If those two queries involve the same gnome and have distances that differ by 1, then the other gnomes in those queries might be adjacent.Wait, let me think. Suppose Bilbo queries G1-G2 with distance d, and G1-G3 with distance d+1. Then, G2 and G3 might be adjacent. Because if G1 is d apart from G2, and d+1 apart from G3, then G2 and G3 are 1 apart. So, their distance would be 1, meaning they are adjacent.Wait, that seems promising. So, if Bilbo can find two queries involving the same gnome where the distances differ by 1, then the other two gnomes in those queries are adjacent.So, here's the strategy:1. Fix a gnome, say G1.2. Query G1 with 50 other gnomes, say G2, G3, ..., G51.3. For each query, record the distance d_i between G1 and G_i.4. Look for two gnomes G_a and G_b such that |d_a - d_b| = 1.5. Then, query G_a and G_b. If their distance is 1, they are adjacent.Wait, but step 5 would require an additional query, which would exceed the 50 question limit.Wait, but maybe we can do it without step 5.Wait, if we have two gnomes G_a and G_b such that |d_a - d_b| = 1, then the distance between G_a and G_b must be 1, because in a circle, the distance between two points is the minimal difference between their positions.Wait, let me clarify. Suppose G1 is at position 0. G_a is at position d_a, and G_b is at position d_b. If |d_a - d_b| = 1, then the distance between G_a and G_b is 1, meaning they are adjacent.Therefore, if Bilbo can find two gnomes G_a and G_b such that their distances from G1 differ by 1, then G_a and G_b are adjacent.So, the strategy is:- Query G1 with 50 other gnomes, getting 50 distances.- Among these 50 distances, look for two that differ by exactly 1.- If such a pair exists, those two gnomes are adjacent.- If not, then all distances are at least 2 apart, which would mean that G1 is not adjacent to any of the 50 gnomes, but since G1 has only two neighbors, this would imply that the two neighbors are among the remaining 48 gnomes (since 99 - 1 - 50 = 48). But wait, 99 - 1 - 50 = 48, so there are 48 gnomes not queried with G1. But G1 has only two neighbors, so if neither neighbor was among the 50 queried, then the two neighbors are among the 48 not queried. But then, Bilbo hasn't queried them, so he doesn't know.Wait, but this approach might not cover all cases. Because if the two neighbors of G1 are not among the 50 queried, then Bilbo won't find them this way.So, perhaps this strategy isn't foolproof.Wait, but let's think about it. If Bilbo queries G1 with 50 other gnomes, the probability that neither of G1's neighbors is among those 50 is (48/98)*(47/97)*... but we need a guarantee, not a probability.So, perhaps this approach can't guarantee finding an adjacent pair because the two neighbors might not be among the 50 queried.Wait, but maybe we can adjust the strategy. Instead of fixing G1, maybe vary the starting gnome.Wait, here's another idea: use multiple starting points. For example, query G1 with 25 gnomes, and G2 with 25 gnomes. Then, among these 50 queries, look for two gnomes whose distances from G1 and G2 differ by 1. But this seems complicated.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that in a circle of 99 gnomes, the number of pairs with distance 0 is 99, and the total number of pairs is 4851. So, the density is low, but with 50 queries, we can cover a significant portion.Wait, but again, without a systematic way, it's hard to guarantee.Wait, here's a different angle: consider that each query can potentially eliminate a certain number of possibilities. If Bilbo can design his queries to eliminate as many non-adjacent pairs as possible, he can narrow down the search.But I'm not sure how to quantify that.Wait, another thought: use the concept of a \\"distance matrix\\" and look for a zero. But again, without constructing the full matrix, it's hard.Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that with 50 queries, Bilbo can cover 100 gnome positions (since each query involves two gnomes). But there are only 99 gnomes, so by the pigeonhole principle, at least one gnome is involved in two queries. If those two queries have distances that differ by 1, then the other gnomes in those queries are adjacent.Wait, let's formalize this:Suppose Bilbo makes 50 queries, each involving two gnomes. Since there are 99 gnomes, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one gnome is involved in at least two queries. Let's say gnome G is involved in two queries: G-A and G-B, with distances d1 and d2 respectively.If |d1 - d2| = 1, then the distance between A and B is 1, meaning they are adjacent.Therefore, if Bilbo can ensure that in his 50 queries, there exists at least one gnome G that is involved in two queries where the distances differ by 1, then he can identify an adjacent pair.But how can he ensure that?Well, if he makes 50 queries, each involving a unique pair, but ensuring that for some gnome G, two of its queries have distances differing by 1.But how can he do that without knowing the distances in advance?Wait, perhaps he can use a systematic way of querying pairs such that for each gnome, he queries it with gnomes at distances that are consecutive.But without knowing the distances, he can't do that.Wait, maybe a better approach is to realize that in any set of 50 queries, there must be at least one gnome involved in two queries where the distances differ by 1.But is that necessarily true?Wait, let's think about it. If Bilbo makes 50 queries, each involving two gnomes, then the total number of gnome participations is 100. Since there are 99 gnomes, one gnome must be involved in at least two queries.Let's say gnome G is involved in two queries: G-A and G-B, with distances d1 and d2.Now, the possible differences between d1 and d2 can range from 0 to 49.But is it guaranteed that for some G, |d1 - d2| = 1?Not necessarily. It's possible that all differences are greater than 1.Wait, but in a circle, the distances are arranged such that for any gnome G, the distances to other gnomes are all distinct modulo 99. So, for any G, the distances to other gnomes are 0,1,2,...,49,50,...,98, but since the minimal distance is taken, it's 0,1,2,...,49.Wait, no, actually, for any G, the minimal distances to other gnomes are 0,1,2,...,49, each appearing exactly twice (except for distance 0, which appears once).Wait, no, in a circle of 99, each distance from 1 to 49 appears exactly twice for each gnome: once in each direction.Wait, actually, for a circle with an odd number of nodes, each distance from 1 to (n-1)/2 appears twice, and the distance (n-1)/2 appears once if n is odd.Wait, 99 is odd, so (99-1)/2 = 49. So, for each gnome, the distances to others are 0,1,2,...,49, each appearing exactly twice except for distance 49, which appears once.Wait, no, actually, for each gnome, the distances to others are 0 (itself), and for each k from 1 to 49, there are two gnomes at distance k (one in each direction). So, for each k from 1 to 49, there are two gnomes at that distance.Therefore, for any gnome G, the distances to others are 0,1,1,2,2,...,49,49.So, if Bilbo queries G with 50 other gnomes, he will get 50 distances, which are 1,1,2,2,...,25,25,26,26,...,49,49, but wait, 50 is even, so he can't have 50 unique distances. Wait, actually, each distance from 1 to 49 appears twice, so 98 gnomes. But since he's querying 50, he might get some distances repeated.Wait, but in any case, if he queries 50 pairs involving G, he will have 50 distances, each from 1 to 49, possibly with repeats.Now, the key is that in these 50 distances, there must be at least two distances that are consecutive integers. Because if you have 50 numbers from 1 to 49, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one number must appear at least twice. But that's not directly helpful.Wait, but actually, if you have 50 numbers from 1 to 49, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one number appears at least twice. But we need consecutive numbers.Wait, perhaps a better way: consider that the distances are 1 to 49, and we have 50 queries. So, the average distance is around 25, but that doesn't help.Wait, perhaps think of it as a sequence of 50 distances. If we sort them, there must be at least two consecutive numbers somewhere in the sequence.But is that necessarily true?Wait, no. For example, you could have all even numbers, but since 50 is more than 25, you can't have all even numbers without repeats.Wait, actually, the maximum number of non-consecutive numbers you can have in 1 to 49 is 25 (all odds or all evens). But since we have 50 numbers, which is more than 25, we must have at least one pair of consecutive numbers.Wait, yes! Because if you try to avoid consecutive numbers, the maximum number of numbers you can choose is 25 (either all odds or all evens). But since we have 50 numbers, which is double that, we must have at least one pair of consecutive numbers.Wait, but actually, in our case, the distances are not necessarily unique. So, even if we have repeats, the key is that in 50 distances, there must be at least two distances that are consecutive integers.Wait, let me think carefully. Suppose we have 50 distances, each between 1 and 49. If we try to arrange them so that no two are consecutive, what's the maximum number we can have?In the best case, we can have all even numbers or all odd numbers, which gives us 25 numbers. But since we have 50 numbers, which is double that, we must have at least one pair of consecutive numbers.Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because even if we have repeats, the maximum number of non-consecutive numbers is still 25. So, if we have 50 numbers, even with repeats, we must have at least one pair of consecutive numbers.Wait, actually, no. Because if you have 50 numbers, each being either 1 or 2, you can have 50 numbers without any consecutive numbers beyond 1 and 2. Wait, no, because 1 and 2 are consecutive.Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something.Wait, let's think of it as a sequence of numbers. If you have 50 numbers, each between 1 and 49, can you arrange them such that no two are consecutive?The maximum number of non-consecutive numbers you can have in 1 to 49 is 25 (e.g., all odds). But since we have 50 numbers, which is more than 25, we must have at least one pair of consecutive numbers.Wait, but actually, that's not necessarily true because you can have multiple instances of the same number. For example, you can have 50 instances of the number 1, which are all the same, so no two are consecutive in the sense of differing by 1.Wait, but in our case, the distances are not necessarily unique. So, if Bilbo queries G with 50 other gnomes, he could get 50 distances, some of which might be the same. So, it's possible that all distances are, say, 1, or all are 25, etc.Therefore, the earlier reasoning doesn't hold because we can have all distances being the same, avoiding consecutive numbers.Wait, so perhaps that approach doesn't work.Wait, but in reality, for any gnome G, the distances to others are 1,1,2,2,...,49,49. So, if Bilbo queries G with 50 other gnomes, he will get 50 distances, which are a subset of these. Since there are 98 other gnomes, each with a unique distance (each distance from 1 to 49 appears twice), but he's only querying 50, so he might get some distances repeated.But the key is that in these 50 distances, there must be at least one pair of consecutive numbers.Wait, let's think about it differently. The distances are from 1 to 49, each appearing twice. If Bilbo queries 50 pairs, he's selecting 50 distances from these 98 (since each distance appears twice). So, the number of possible distinct distances is 49. Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one distance must appear at least ⎡50/49⎤ = 2 times.But that doesn't necessarily give us consecutive distances.Wait, perhaps another approach: consider that the distances are arranged in a circle. If Bilbo queries 50 pairs, he can potentially cover all possible distances, but I'm not sure.Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to think of a different strategy.Wait, here's a different idea inspired by the concept of a \\"covering code.\\" If Bilbo can design his queries such that every possible adjacent pair is \\"covered\\" by at least one query, then he can guarantee finding an adjacent pair. But with 50 queries, he can cover 100 gnome positions, but there are 99 gnomes, so it's possible that he covers all except one. But since each query covers two gnomes, it's possible that all adjacent pairs are covered.Wait, but there are 99 adjacent pairs, so to cover all, he needs at least 50 queries (since each query can cover two adjacent pairs if they share a gnome). Wait, no, each query is a pair, not a trio.Wait, perhaps if he arranges his queries such that each query overlaps with the next, like a sliding window.For example, query G1-G2, G2-G3, G3-G4, ..., G50-G51. That's 50 queries, covering 51 gnomes. But there are 99 gnomes, so he's missing 48. Therefore, he hasn't covered all adjacent pairs.But if he does this for multiple starting points, maybe he can cover all.Wait, but with 50 queries, it's impossible to cover all 99 adjacent pairs.Wait, another idea: use the fact that in a circle, the sum of distances around the circle is 99. So, if Bilbo can find a set of distances that add up to 99, he can find a cycle, but I'm not sure.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the problem again.We have 99 gnomes in a circle. Bilbo can ask about any two, and get the minimal distance. He needs to find at least one adjacent pair (distance 0) with no more than 50 questions.Wait, but the problem says \\"at least one pair of adjacent sitting gnomes.\\" So, he doesn't need to find all, just one.Wait, here's a simple strategy:1. Choose any gnome, say G1.2. Query G1 with 50 other gnomes: G2, G3, ..., G51.3. For each query, if the distance is 0, he's found an adjacent pair.4. If none of the distances are 0, then G1's two neighbors are among the remaining 48 gnomes (since 99 - 1 - 50 = 48).5. Now, choose another gnome, say G52, and query G52 with 50 other gnomes, but this would exceed the 50 question limit.Wait, so this approach doesn't work because it requires more than 50 questions.Wait, but perhaps instead of fixing G1, he can vary his queries to cover more potential adjacents.Wait, here's a better idea inspired by the \\"double elimination\\" method:1. Divide the 99 gnomes into two groups: A and B, each with 49 gnomes, and one leftover gnome, say G1.2. Query all possible pairs between group A and group B. There are 49*49 = 2401 pairs, which is way too many.Wait, no, that's not feasible.Wait, perhaps instead, use a strategy where each query potentially eliminates a gnome from being adjacent to another.Wait, but I'm not sure.Wait, here's a different approach inspired by the concept of a \\"distance oracle.\\" If Bilbo can find a gnome that has a distance of 1 from another, he's done. So, he can perform a binary search for such a pair.But without knowing the order, it's tricky.Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that in a circle, the number of pairs with distance 1 is 99, and the total number of pairs is 4851. So, the probability of randomly selecting a pair with distance 1 is 99/4851 ≈ 0.0204, as I thought earlier.But with 50 questions, the expected number of adjacent pairs found is 50 * 0.0204 ≈ 1.02, so on average, he might find one. But the problem is asking if he can guarantee finding one, not just probabilistically.Wait, but maybe there's a deterministic way to ensure that at least one adjacent pair is among the 50 queries.Wait, here's a thought: if Bilbo can arrange his 50 queries such that every possible adjacent pair is included in at least one query, then he can guarantee finding one. But with 99 adjacent pairs, he can't cover all with 50 queries.Wait, but perhaps he can use the fact that each query can cover two adjacent pairs if they share a common gnome.Wait, for example, querying G1-G2 covers the adjacent pair G1-G2 if they are adjacent, and also potentially covers G2-G3 if G2 is queried with G3.But without knowing the order, it's hard to ensure.Wait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that in any set of 50 queries, there must be at least one adjacent pair. But I don't think that's necessarily true.Wait, for example, Bilbo could query pairs that are all separated by at least two seats, thus avoiding all adjacent pairs.But the problem is asking if he can find at least one adjacent pair with 50 questions, not whether he must find one.So, the question is whether there exists a strategy that guarantees finding at least one adjacent pair within 50 questions.Given that, perhaps the answer is yes, and the strategy involves querying pairs in such a way that the responses allow deducing an adjacent pair.Wait, here's a possible strategy inspired by the concept of a \\"distance matrix\\" and looking for a zero:1. Choose a gnome, say G1.2. Query G1 with 50 other gnomes: G2, G3, ..., G51.3. For each query, record the distance d_i.4. Now, among these 50 distances, look for any two gnomes G_a and G_b such that d_a + d_b + 1 = 99. Because if G1 is d_a away from G_a in one direction and d_b away from G_b in the other direction, then G_a and G_b would be adjacent if d_a + d_b + 1 = 99.Wait, let me clarify. If G1 is at position 0, G_a is at position d_a, and G_b is at position 99 - d_b (since it's the other direction). Then, the distance between G_a and G_b would be |d_a - (99 - d_b)|. If this equals 1, then they are adjacent.But this seems complicated.Wait, perhaps a simpler way: if G1 is d_a away from G_a in one direction, and d_b away from G_b in the other direction, then the distance between G_a and G_b is |d_a + d_b - 99|. If this equals 1, they are adjacent.Wait, but without knowing the direction, it's hard to apply.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of modular arithmetic. The distance between G_a and G_b is min(|d_a - d_b|, 99 - |d_a - d_b|). So, if |d_a - d_b| = 1, then they are adjacent.Therefore, if among the 50 distances from G1, there are two distances that differ by 1, then the corresponding gnomes are adjacent.So, the strategy is:1. Query G1 with 50 other gnomes, getting 50 distances.2. Check if any two distances differ by 1.3. If yes, then those two gnomes are adjacent.4. If no, then G1's two neighbors are among the remaining 48 gnomes, and we can repeat the process with another gnome.But wait, we only have 50 questions. If we spend 50 questions on G1, we can't query another gnome.Wait, but perhaps we can do better. If we query G1 with 25 gnomes, and another gnome G2 with 25 gnomes, that's 50 questions. Then, among these 50 queries, look for two gnomes whose distances from G1 and G2 differ by 1, indicating they are adjacent.But this is getting too vague.Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that with 50 queries, Bilbo can cover enough pairs to guarantee that at least one adjacent pair is included.But I'm not sure how to formalize this.Wait, here's a different angle: consider that each query can potentially identify a non-adjacent pair, but we need to find an adjacent one. So, perhaps the strategy is to eliminate non-adjacent pairs until we're left with an adjacent one.But with 50 queries, it's not clear.Wait, another idea: use the concept of a \\"distance labeling.\\" Assign each gnome a label based on their distance from a fixed point. If two gnomes have labels that are consecutive, they are adjacent.But without knowing the labels, it's hard.Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and the strategy is to query pairs in such a way that the responses allow deducing an adjacent pair.But I'm not entirely sure, but given the time I've spent, I think the answer is yes, Bilbo can find at least one adjacent pair with 50 questions."},{"question":"Miriam has five times as many albums as Katrina.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand the problem. I need to count all 100-digit numbers where each digit is either 0, 1, or 3, and the number is even. So, the number has 100 digits, which means the first digit can't be 0 because that would make it a 99-digit number. Got it.Since it's a 100-digit number, the first digit must be either 1 or 3. The other digits can be 0, 1, or 3. But wait, the number also has to be even. For a number to be even, its last digit must be even. Looking at the allowed digits: 0, 1, 3. Among these, only 0 is even. So, the last digit has to be 0. That simplifies things a bit.So, breaking it down:1. The first digit: can be 1 or 3. So, 2 choices.2. The last digit: must be 0. So, only 1 choice.3. The middle digits (digits 2 to 99): each can be 0, 1, or 3. So, 3 choices for each.Therefore, the total number of such numbers should be the product of the number of choices for each digit.Let me write that out:Total numbers = (choices for first digit) × (choices for digits 2 to 99) × (choices for last digit)Plugging in the numbers:Total numbers = 2 × (3^98) × 1Wait, why 3^98? Because digits 2 to 99 are 98 digits, each with 3 choices. Yeah, that makes sense.So, simplifying, it's 2 × 3^98.But let me double-check. Is there any restriction I might have missed? The number has to be 100 digits, so first digit can't be 0, which I considered. The number has to be even, so last digit must be 0, which I also considered. The middle digits can be 0, 1, or 3, which is 3 choices each. So, yeah, that seems right.Just to make sure, let me think about a smaller case. Suppose instead of 100 digits, we have a 2-digit number. How many such even numbers would there be?First digit: 1 or 3 (2 choices)Last digit: 0 (1 choice)Total: 2 × 1 = 2 numbers. Let's list them: 10 and 30. Yep, that's correct.Another test: 3-digit numbers. First digit: 2 choices, middle digit: 3 choices, last digit: 1 choice. So, total 2 × 3 × 1 = 6 numbers.Listing them: 100, 110, 130, 300, 310, 330. That's six numbers, which seems right.So, scaling this up to 100 digits, the logic holds. First digit: 2 choices, middle 98 digits: 3^98 choices, last digit: 1 choice. So, total is 2 × 3^98.Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using permutations or combinations, but in this case, since each digit is independent, it's just a matter of multiplying the number of choices for each position.Alternatively, the total number of 100-digit numbers with digits 0,1,3 is 2 × 3^99 (since first digit 2 choices, others 3 each). But since we need only even numbers, which are half of all numbers? Wait, no, not exactly, because not all numbers end with 0,1,3. Only those ending with 0 are even.So, in the total set, the last digit can be 0,1,3. So, the probability that a number is even is 1/3, since only 0 is even. Therefore, the number of even numbers would be (2 × 3^99) × (1/3) = 2 × 3^98, which matches our earlier result.That's a good consistency check. So, both approaches give the same answer, which is reassuring.Therefore, I think the answer is 2 multiplied by 3 raised to the power of 98.**Final Answer**The number of such 100-digit even numbers is boxed{2 times 3^{98}}."},{"question":"Compute cos 210^circ.","answer":"To compute the cosine of 210 degrees, I first recognize that 210 degrees is located in the third quadrant of the unit circle.

The reference angle helps simplify the calculation since I know the cosine of 30 degrees is √3/2.Finally, since cosine is negative in the third quadrant, I apply the negative sign to the cosine of the reference angle. This results in the cosine of 210 degrees being -√3/2."},{"question":"Let t(x) = sqrt{3x+1} and f(x)=5-t(x). What is t(f(5))?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find t(f(5)). Hmm, let me break it down step by step. First, I know that t(x) is defined as the square root of (3x + 1), so t(x) = sqrt(3x + 1). Then, f(x) is given as 5 minus t(x), which means f(x) = 5 - sqrt(3x + 1). Alright, so I need to find t(f(5)). That means I have to first find f(5) and then plug that result into t(x). Let me start by calculating f(5). To find f(5), I substitute x with 5 in the function f(x). So, f(5) = 5 - sqrt(3*5 + 1). Let me compute the inside of the square root first. 3 times 5 is 15, and adding 1 gives me 16. So, sqrt(16) is 4. Therefore, f(5) = 5 - 4, which equals 1. Wait, so f(5) is 1. Now, I need to find t(f(5)), which is t(1). So, I substitute x with 1 in the function t(x). That gives me t(1) = sqrt(3*1 + 1). Let me compute that. 3 times 1 is 3, plus 1 is 4. The square root of 4 is 2. So, putting it all together, t(f(5)) is 2. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, f(5): 3*5 is 15, plus 1 is 16, sqrt(16) is 4, so 5 - 4 is 1. That seems right. Then, t(1): 3*1 is 3, plus 1 is 4, sqrt(4) is 2. Yep, that looks correct. I think I got it. So, the final answer should be 2.**Final Answer**The value of ( t(f(5)) ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"When using the completing the square method to solve the quadratic equation x^{2}+6x-1=0, and transforming it into the form left(x+aright)^{2}=b, the value of a+b is ______.","answer":"To solve the quadratic equation ( x^2 + 6x - 1 = 0 ) using the completing the square method, I will follow these steps.First, I move the constant term to the other side of the equation to isolate the variable terms:[ x^2 + 6x = 1 ]Next, I determine the value needed to complete the square.

Cards inscribed with squares of integers are removed, and the remaining cards are renumbered starting from 1.Then, the operation of removing the squares is repeated. How many times must this operation be repeated to remove all the cards?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 900 cards numbered from 1 to 900. The task is to remove all the cards that are perfect squares, then renumber the remaining cards starting from 1. Then, repeat this operation of removing squares until all cards are removed. I need to figure out how many times this operation must be repeated to remove all the cards.Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's understand the initial setup. We have 900 cards, each labeled with a unique natural number from 1 to 900. So, the first operation is to remove all the perfect squares. Perfect squares are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., up to 900. I need to find how many perfect squares are there between 1 and 900.To find the number of perfect squares, I can take the square root of 900, which is 30. So, there are 30 perfect squares between 1 and 900. That means, after the first operation, we remove 30 cards, leaving us with 900 - 30 = 870 cards.Now, the remaining 870 cards are renumbered starting from 1. So, the first card after renumbering is 1, the next is 2, and so on up to 870. Then, we perform the same operation again: remove all perfect squares from this new set.Wait, so in the second operation, we're looking for perfect squares in the range 1 to 870. Let me calculate how many perfect squares are there in this new range. The square root of 870 is approximately 29.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a square, we take the integer part, which is 29. So, there are 29 perfect squares in the second operation. That means we remove 29 cards, leaving us with 870 - 29 = 841 cards.Again, these 841 cards are renumbered from 1 to 841. Now, the third operation involves removing perfect squares from 1 to 841. The square root of 841 is exactly 29, so there are 29 perfect squares here. Removing these 29 cards leaves us with 841 - 29 = 812 cards.Wait, hold on. That seems a bit odd because 29 squared is 841, so the number of perfect squares should be 29, right? So, removing 29 cards each time. But let me check the numbers again.First operation: 900 cards, remove 30 squares, left with 870.Second operation: 870 cards, remove 29 squares, left with 841.Third operation: 841 cards, remove 29 squares, left with 812.Wait, that doesn't seem right because 841 is a perfect square itself (29 squared), so when we remove the squares, we should remove 29 cards, but 841 is included in the count. So, after removing 29 squares, we have 841 - 29 = 812.But hold on, 812 is not a perfect square, so the next operation would be on 812 cards.Fourth operation: 812 cards. The square root of 812 is approximately 28.5, so we take 28. So, we remove 28 squares, leaving us with 812 - 28 = 784 cards.Fifth operation: 784 cards. The square root of 784 is 28, so we remove 28 squares, leaving us with 784 - 28 = 756 cards.Wait, but 784 is 28 squared, so the number of squares is 28. So, removing 28 leaves 756.Continuing this pattern:Sixth operation: 756 cards. Square root is approximately 27.5, so 27 squares removed. 756 - 27 = 729.Seventh operation: 729 cards. Square root is 27, so remove 27 squares. 729 - 27 = 702.Eighth operation: 702 cards. Square root is approximately 26.5, so 26 squares removed. 702 - 26 = 676.Ninth operation: 676 cards. Square root is 26, so remove 26 squares. 676 - 26 = 650.Tenth operation: 650 cards. Square root is approximately 25.5, so 25 squares removed. 650 - 25 = 625.Eleventh operation: 625 cards. Square root is 25, so remove 25 squares. 625 - 25 = 600.Twelfth operation: 600 cards. Square root is approximately 24.5, so 24 squares removed. 600 - 24 = 576.Thirteenth operation: 576 cards. Square root is 24, so remove 24 squares. 576 - 24 = 552.Fourteenth operation: 552 cards. Square root is approximately 23.5, so 23 squares removed. 552 - 23 = 529.Fifteenth operation: 529 cards. Square root is 23, so remove 23 squares. 529 - 23 = 506.Sixteenth operation: 506 cards. Square root is approximately 22.5, so 22 squares removed. 506 - 22 = 484.Seventeenth operation: 484 cards. Square root is 22, so remove 22 squares. 484 - 22 = 462.Eighteenth operation: 462 cards. Square root is approximately 21.5, so 21 squares removed. 462 - 21 = 441.Nineteenth operation: 441 cards. Square root is 21, so remove 21 squares. 441 - 21 = 420.Twentieth operation: 420 cards. Square root is approximately 20.5, so 20 squares removed. 420 - 20 = 400.Twenty-first operation: 400 cards. Square root is 20, so remove 20 squares. 400 - 20 = 380.Twenty-second operation: 380 cards. Square root is approximately 19.5, so 19 squares removed. 380 - 19 = 361.Twenty-third operation: 361 cards. Square root is 19, so remove 19 squares. 361 - 19 = 342.Twenty-fourth operation: 342 cards. Square root is approximately 18.5, so 18 squares removed. 342 - 18 = 324.Twenty-fifth operation: 324 cards. Square root is 18, so remove 18 squares. 324 - 18 = 306.Twenty-sixth operation: 306 cards. Square root is approximately 17.5, so 17 squares removed. 306 - 17 = 289.Twenty-seventh operation: 289 cards. Square root is 17, so remove 17 squares. 289 - 17 = 272.Twenty-eighth operation: 272 cards. Square root is approximately 16.5, so 16 squares removed. 272 - 16 = 256.Twenty-ninth operation: 256 cards. Square root is 16, so remove 16 squares. 256 - 16 = 240.Thirtieth operation: 240 cards. Square root is approximately 15.5, so 15 squares removed. 240 - 15 = 225.Thirty-first operation: 225 cards. Square root is 15, so remove 15 squares. 225 - 15 = 210.Thirty-second operation: 210 cards. Square root is approximately 14.5, so 14 squares removed. 210 - 14 = 196.Thirty-third operation: 196 cards. Square root is 14, so remove 14 squares. 196 - 14 = 182.Thirty-fourth operation: 182 cards. Square root is approximately 13.5, so 13 squares removed. 182 - 13 = 169.Thirty-fifth operation: 169 cards. Square root is 13, so remove 13 squares. 169 - 13 = 156.Thirty-sixth operation: 156 cards. Square root is approximately 12.5, so 12 squares removed. 156 - 12 = 144.Thirty-seventh operation: 144 cards. Square root is 12, so remove 12 squares. 144 - 12 = 132.Thirty-eighth operation: 132 cards. Square root is approximately 11.5, so 11 squares removed. 132 - 11 = 121.Thirty-ninth operation: 121 cards. Square root is 11, so remove 11 squares. 121 - 11 = 110.Fortieth operation: 110 cards. Square root is approximately 10.5, so 10 squares removed. 110 - 10 = 100.Forty-first operation: 100 cards. Square root is 10, so remove 10 squares. 100 - 10 = 90.Forty-second operation: 90 cards. Square root is approximately 9.5, so 9 squares removed. 90 - 9 = 81.Forty-third operation: 81 cards. Square root is 9, so remove 9 squares. 81 - 9 = 72.Forty-fourth operation: 72 cards. Square root is approximately 8.5, so 8 squares removed. 72 - 8 = 64.Forty-fifth operation: 64 cards. Square root is 8, so remove 8 squares. 64 - 8 = 56.Forty-sixth operation: 56 cards. Square root is approximately 7.5, so 7 squares removed. 56 - 7 = 49.Forty-seventh operation: 49 cards. Square root is 7, so remove 7 squares. 49 - 7 = 42.Forty-eighth operation: 42 cards. Square root is approximately 6.5, so 6 squares removed. 42 - 6 = 36.Forty-ninth operation: 36 cards. Square root is 6, so remove 6 squares. 36 - 6 = 30.Fiftieth operation: 30 cards. Square root is approximately 5.5, so 5 squares removed. 30 - 5 = 25.Fifty-first operation: 25 cards. Square root is 5, so remove 5 squares. 25 - 5 = 20.Fifty-second operation: 20 cards. Square root is approximately 4.5, so 4 squares removed. 20 - 4 = 16.Fifty-third operation: 16 cards. Square root is 4, so remove 4 squares. 16 - 4 = 12.Fifty-fourth operation: 12 cards. Square root is approximately 3.5, so 3 squares removed. 12 - 3 = 9.Fifty-fifth operation: 9 cards. Square root is 3, so remove 3 squares. 9 - 3 = 6.Fifty-sixth operation: 6 cards. Square root is approximately 2.5, so 2 squares removed. 6 - 2 = 4.Fifty-seventh operation: 4 cards. Square root is 2, so remove 2 squares. 4 - 2 = 2.Fifty-eighth operation: 2 cards. Square root is approximately 1.5, so 1 square removed. 2 - 1 = 1.Fifty-ninth operation: 1 card. Square root is 1, so remove 1 square. 1 - 1 = 0.Wait, so after 59 operations, all cards are removed. But that seems like a lot. Is there a pattern or a formula that can help me find the number of operations without listing each step?Let me think. Each operation removes the square numbers from the current set of cards. After each operation, the number of cards decreases by the number of squares in that range. The number of squares in a range from 1 to N is floor(sqrt(N)). So, each time, the number of cards becomes N - floor(sqrt(N)).So, starting with N0 = 900.N1 = 900 - floor(sqrt(900)) = 900 - 30 = 870.N2 = 870 - floor(sqrt(870)) = 870 - 29 = 841.N3 = 841 - floor(sqrt(841)) = 841 - 29 = 812.Wait, but 841 is 29 squared, so floor(sqrt(841)) is 29, so N3 = 841 - 29 = 812.Similarly, N4 = 812 - floor(sqrt(812)) = 812 - 28 = 784.N5 = 784 - floor(sqrt(784)) = 784 - 28 = 756.Wait, 784 is 28 squared, so floor(sqrt(784)) is 28, so N5 = 756.Continuing this way, each time N decreases by floor(sqrt(N)).I can see that each time, the number of cards reduces by approximately sqrt(N), but it's not exactly a straightforward sequence.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a sequence where each term is N_{k+1} = N_k - floor(sqrt(N_k)).We need to find the smallest k such that N_k = 0.But calculating this manually for 59 steps is tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or a mathematical approach.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as repeatedly subtracting the integer square roots until we reach zero.But I don't recall a direct formula for this. Maybe I can approximate the number of steps.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of times we can subtract the square root of the current number until it reaches zero.But since each step reduces N by roughly sqrt(N), the number of steps would be roughly proportional to the integral of 1/sqrt(x) from 1 to N, which is 2*sqrt(N). But this is a rough approximation.For N=900, 2*sqrt(900)=60. So, approximately 60 steps. But in my manual calculation, it took 59 steps. That seems close.Wait, but in the manual calculation, it took 59 steps, which is just one less than 60. So, maybe the exact number is 59.But let me check if my manual calculation was correct.Wait, let me recount the steps quickly:Starting from 900, each operation reduces N by floor(sqrt(N)).1. 900 - 30 = 8702. 870 - 29 = 8413. 841 - 29 = 8124. 812 - 28 = 7845. 784 - 28 = 7566. 756 - 27 = 7297. 729 - 27 = 7028. 702 - 26 = 6769. 676 - 26 = 65010. 650 - 25 = 62511. 625 - 25 = 60012. 600 - 24 = 57613. 576 - 24 = 55214. 552 - 23 = 52915. 529 - 23 = 50616. 506 - 22 = 48417. 484 - 22 = 46218. 462 - 21 = 44119. 441 - 21 = 42020. 420 - 20 = 40021. 400 - 20 = 38022. 380 - 19 = 36123. 361 - 19 = 34224. 342 - 18 = 32425. 324 - 18 = 30626. 306 - 17 = 28927. 289 - 17 = 27228. 272 - 16 = 25629. 256 - 16 = 24030. 240 - 15 = 22531. 225 - 15 = 21032. 210 - 14 = 19633. 196 - 14 = 18234. 182 - 13 = 16935. 169 - 13 = 15636. 156 - 12 = 14437. 144 - 12 = 13238. 132 - 11 = 12139. 121 - 11 = 11040. 110 - 10 = 10041. 100 - 10 = 9042. 90 - 9 = 8143. 81 - 9 = 7244. 72 - 8 = 6445. 64 - 8 = 5646. 56 - 7 = 4947. 49 - 7 = 4248. 42 - 6 = 3649. 36 - 6 = 3050. 30 - 5 = 2551. 25 - 5 = 2052. 20 - 4 = 1653. 16 - 4 = 1254. 12 - 3 = 955. 9 - 3 = 656. 6 - 2 = 457. 4 - 2 = 258. 2 - 1 = 159. 1 - 1 = 0Yes, that's 59 operations.But wait, the approximation was 2*sqrt(900)=60, which is very close to 59. So, it's about 60 operations.But since in the manual count, it took 59 steps, maybe the answer is 59.But let me think again. Is there a way to model this as a recurrence relation?Let me define N_k as the number of cards after k operations.N_{k+1} = N_k - floor(sqrt(N_k)).We start with N_0 = 900.We need to find the smallest k such that N_k = 0.This is similar to repeatedly subtracting the integer square root of the current number until it reaches zero.I recall that the number of steps required for such a process is roughly proportional to 2*sqrt(N), but slightly less because each step subtracts a bit more than the previous step.But in our case, it's exactly 59 steps.Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a known result for this.Wait, I found a similar problem before where the number of steps to reduce N to zero by subtracting the integer square root each time is approximately 2*sqrt(N). But in our case, it's 59, which is just one less than 60.But perhaps the exact number is 59.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the manual count.Wait, let me recount the steps more carefully.Starting from N0=900.1. N1=900-30=8702. N2=870-29=8413. N3=841-29=8124. N4=812-28=7845. N5=784-28=7566. N6=756-27=7297. N7=729-27=7028. N8=702-26=6769. N9=676-26=65010. N10=650-25=62511. N11=625-25=60012. N12=600-24=57613.

N59=1-1=0Yes, that's 59 operations. So, the answer is 59.But wait, let me think again. Is there a smarter way to compute this without listing all 59 steps?I think the key is that each operation removes floor(sqrt(N)) cards, so the number of operations is roughly the sum of 1/(sqrt(N)) from N=1 to N=900, but that's not exactly correct because each step depends on the previous.Alternatively, maybe it's similar to the Josephus problem, but I don't think so.Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as N_{k+1} = N_k - sqrt(N_k), but since we're dealing with integers, it's floor(sqrt(N_k)).But integrating 1/sqrt(x) from 1 to 900 gives 2*sqrt(900) - 2*sqrt(1) = 60 - 2 = 58. So, approximately 58 steps, but in reality, it's 59.So, the integral approximation gives 58, but the actual number is 59.Therefore, the answer is 59.But wait, let me check if I can find a formula or a better way.I found a resource that says the number of steps to reduce N to zero by subtracting floor(sqrt(N)) each time is approximately 2*sqrt(N) - c, where c is a constant.In our case, 2*sqrt(900)=60, so 60 - c=59, so c=1.So, the formula would be approximately 2*sqrt(N) - 1.But let me test this with smaller N.For example, N=1:Steps: 1 operation.Formula: 2*sqrt(1) -1=2-1=1. Correct.N=2:1. Remove 1 square, left with 1.2. Remove 1 square, done.Total steps:2.Formula: 2*sqrt(2) -1≈2.828-1≈1.828≈2. Correct.N=3:1. Remove 1 square, left with 2.2. Remove 1 square, left with1.3. Remove 1 square, done.Total steps:3.Formula:2*sqrt(3)-1≈3.464-1≈2.464≈2. But actual steps are 3. Hmm, discrepancy.Wait, maybe the formula is not exact.Alternatively, perhaps the number of steps is roughly 2*sqrt(N) - c, where c is around 1 or 2.But in our case, N=900, 2*sqrt(900)=60, steps=59, so c=1.So, the formula would be 2*sqrt(N) -1.But for N=3, 2*sqrt(3)-1≈2.464, which is less than 3, so the formula underestimates.But for larger N, the approximation becomes better.So, for N=900, it's 60-1=59.Therefore, the answer is 59.Alternatively, perhaps it's exactly 2*sqrt(N) -1 when N is a perfect square.Wait, N=900 is a perfect square (30^2). So, 2*30 -1=59.Similarly, N=4:1. Remove 2 squares (1,4), left with 2.2. Remove 1 square (1), left with1.3. Remove 1 square, done.Total steps:3.Formula:2*sqrt(4)-1=4-1=3. Correct.N=9:1. Remove 3 squares (1,4,9), left with6.2. Remove 2 squares (1,4), left with4.3. Remove 2 squares (1,4), left with2.4. Remove 1 square (1), left with1.5. Remove 1 square, done.Total steps:5.Formula:2*sqrt(9)-1=6-1=5. Correct.N=16:1. Remove 4 squares, left with12.2. Remove 3 squares, left with9.3. Remove 3 squares, left with6.4. Remove 2 squares, left with4.5. Remove 2 squares, left with2.6. Remove 1 square, left with1.7. Remove 1 square, done.Total steps:7.Formula:2*sqrt(16)-1=8-1=7. Correct.So, it seems that when N is a perfect square, the number of steps is exactly 2*sqrt(N) -1.Therefore, for N=900, which is 30^2, the number of steps is 2*30 -1=59.Therefore, the answer is 59.So, I can conclude that the number of operations needed is 59.**Final Answer**The number of operations needed is boxed{59}."},{"question":"Find the differential equation whose general solution is the function ( y = C_1 x + C_2 ), where ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) are arbitrary constants.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find a differential equation whose general solution is ( y = C_1 x + C_2 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when given a general solution with arbitrary constants, the number of constants tells me the order of the differential equation. In this case, there are two constants, ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ), so the differential equation should be second-order. Alright, so I need to eliminate these constants to form a differential equation. Let me start by differentiating the given solution to see how the constants relate to the derivatives of ( y ). First, let's write down the given solution:[ y = C_1 x + C_2 ]If I take the first derivative with respect to ( x ), I get:[ y' = frac{d}{dx}(C_1 x + C_2) = C_1 ]So, the first derivative ( y' ) is equal to ( C_1 ). Now, if I take the second derivative with respect to ( x ), that should eliminate the constant ( C_1 ):[ y'' = frac{d}{dx}(C_1) = 0 ]So, the second derivative ( y'' ) is zero. Hmm, so putting that together, the differential equation is simply:[ y'' = 0 ]Is that all? Let me verify. If I solve ( y'' = 0 ), integrating once gives ( y' = C_1 ), and integrating again gives ( y = C_1 x + C_2 ), which matches the given general solution. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think if there's another way this could be approached, maybe by forming a first-order equation. But no, since there are two arbitrary constants, the differential equation must be second-order. A first-order equation can only have one arbitrary constant in its general solution. Alternatively, could I have approached this by expressing ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) in terms of ( y ) and its derivatives? Let me try that. From the original equation:[ y = C_1 x + C_2 ]We can solve for ( C_2 ):[ C_2 = y - C_1 x ]But from the first derivative, we know ( C_1 = y' ). So substituting that into the equation for ( C_2 ):[ C_2 = y - y' x ]But ( C_2 ) is a constant, so its derivative should be zero. Let's take the derivative of both sides:[ frac{d}{dx}(C_2) = frac{d}{dx}(y - y' x) ]Which simplifies to:[ 0 = y' - (y'' x + y') ]Simplifying the right-hand side:[ 0 = y' - y'' x - y' ][ 0 = - y'' x ]So, ( y'' x = 0 ). Hmm, this suggests that either ( y'' = 0 ) or ( x = 0 ). But ( x = 0 ) is just a single point, not a general solution. Therefore, the only meaningful condition is ( y'' = 0 ). So, that confirms it again. The differential equation is ( y'' = 0 ). Let me think if there's another perspective. Maybe using the concept of linear differential equations. Since the solution is linear in ( x ), the differential equation should be linear as well. A second-order linear differential equation would have the form:[ a(x) y'' + b(x) y' + c(x) y = d(x) ]In our case, since the solution is ( y = C_1 x + C_2 ), which is a polynomial of degree 1, the differential equation should not involve any lower-degree terms beyond constants. If I plug ( y = C_1 x + C_2 ) into the general form, let's see:[ a(x) (0) + b(x) (C_1) + c(x) (C_1 x + C_2) = d(x) ]Simplifying:[ b(x) C_1 + c(x) (C_1 x + C_2) = d(x) ]For this to hold for all ( x ) and for arbitrary constants ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ), the coefficients of ( C_1 x ), ( C_1 ), and ( C_2 ) must each be zero except for the right-hand side. Looking at the terms:- The coefficient of ( C_1 x ) is ( c(x) ). So, ( c(x) = 0 ).- The coefficient of ( C_1 ) is ( b(x) + c(x) ). Since ( c(x) = 0 ), this reduces to ( b(x) = 0 ).- The coefficient of ( C_2 ) is ( c(x) ), which is already zero.- The right-hand side is ( d(x) ), which must also be zero because there are no other terms left.Therefore, all coefficients ( a(x) ), ( b(x) ), ( c(x) ), and ( d(x) ) must be zero except for ( a(x) ), which can be arbitrary. But since ( a(x) ) is multiplied by ( y'' ), which is zero, the equation simplifies to ( 0 = 0 ), which is trivial. Wait, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I should have considered a different approach. But earlier, by directly differentiating, I found that ( y'' = 0 ), which is a valid second-order differential equation. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation in terms of operators. The solution ( y = C_1 x + C_2 ) suggests that the differential operator annihilates ( y ). Since ( y ) is a linear function, the second derivative operator ( D^2 ) where ( D = frac{d}{dx} ) would annihilate it. So, ( D^2 y = 0 ), which is ( y'' = 0 ). Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the differential equation is ( y'' = 0 ). Just to recap:1. Given ( y = C_1 x + C_2 ).2. First derivative: ( y' = C_1 ).3. Second derivative: ( y'' = 0 ).4. Therefore, the differential equation is ( y'' = 0 ).I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. It seems straightforward, but I guess sometimes the simplest solutions are the correct ones. Another way to think about it is that the general solution is a linear function, which is a solution to the equation whose characteristic equation has roots at zero with multiplicity two. Wait, no, actually, for linear functions, the differential equation is ( y'' = 0 ), which corresponds to a characteristic equation ( r^2 = 0 ), giving a repeated root at zero. So, that aligns with the theory. The characteristic equation would be ( r^2 = 0 ), leading to the general solution ( y = C_1 e^{0 x} + C_2 x e^{0 x} = C_1 + C_2 x ), which is exactly what we have. Therefore, all signs point to ( y'' = 0 ) being the correct differential equation. I think I've covered multiple approaches: direct differentiation, operator approach, and characteristic equation. All lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The differential equation is boxed{y'' = 0}."},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, if a_3=3 and a_6=24, then the value of a_8 is.","answer":"First, I recognize that in a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio ( r ).Given that ( a_3 = 3 ) and ( a_6 = 24 ), I can express these terms using the general formula for a geometric sequence:[a_n = a_1 times r^{n-1}]So, ( a_3 = a_1 times r^{2} = 3 ) and ( a_6 = a_1 times r^{5} = 24 ).To find the common ratio ( r ), I divide the equation for ( a_6 ) by the equation for ( a_3 ):[frac{a_6}{a_3} = frac{a_1 times r^{5}}{a_1 times r^{2}} = r^{3} = frac{24}{3} = 8][r = sqrt[3]{8} = 2]Now that I have ( r = 2 ), I can substitute it back into the equation for ( a_3 ) to find ( a_1 ):[a_1 times 2^{2} = 3][a_1 times 4 = 3][a_1 = frac{3}{4}]Finally, to find ( a_8 ), I use the general formula again:[a_8 = a_1 times r^{7} = frac{3}{4} times 2^{7} = frac{3}{4} times 128 = 96]"},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: left(2a+bright)-2left(3a-2bright), where a=-1, b=2.","answer":"First, I need to simplify the expression ((2a + b) - 2(3a - 2b)).I'll start by distributing the (-2) across the terms inside the parentheses.

(2^{3} cdot P_{3}^{3})D. Not less than 49","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of integer solutions to the equation (x^{1988} + y^{1988} + z^{1988} = 7^{1990}). The options are A. 0, B. 1, C. (2^{3} cdot P_{3}^{3}), and D. Not less than 49. Hmm, that's a pretty high exponent, 1988. I wonder if that's a typo or if it's intentional. But okay, let's go with it.First, I should note that 1988 is an even number, so any integer raised to the 1988th power will be non-negative. That means (x^{1988}), (y^{1988}), and (z^{1988}) are all non-negative. So, the left side of the equation is the sum of three non-negative numbers, and the right side is (7^{1990}), which is a positive number.So, we're looking for integers x, y, z such that when each is raised to the 1988th power and summed, they equal (7^{1990}). Since all terms are non-negative, each of x, y, z must satisfy (|x|^{1988} leq 7^{1990}), same for y and z. So, (|x| leq 7^{1990/1988}). Let me compute that exponent: 1990 divided by 1988 is approximately 1.000999... So, (7^{1.000999}) is just a bit more than 7. But since x must be an integer, (|x|) can be at most 7, right? Because 7^1 is 7, and 7^{1.001} is still less than 8, so the integer part is 7.Therefore, x, y, z must each be integers between -7 and 7, inclusive. But actually, since we're raising them to an even power, the sign doesn't matter. So, we can consider x, y, z as non-negative integers from 0 to 7, and then account for the sign later.So, the equation simplifies to (a^{1988} + b^{1988} + c^{1988} = 7^{1990}), where a, b, c are integers from 0 to 7. Now, let's compute what (7^{1990}) is in terms of (7^{1988}). Since 1990 is 1988 + 2, so (7^{1990} = 7^{1988} times 7^2 = 7^{1988} times 49). So, the equation becomes (a^{1988} + b^{1988} + c^{1988} = 49 times 7^{1988}).But wait, (a^{1988}) can be 0, 1, (7^{1988}), or something in between? Wait, no, because a is from 0 to 7. So, (a^{1988}) is either 0 or (k^{1988}) where k is from 1 to 7. But 1^{1988} is 1, 2^{1988} is a huge number, but let's see:Wait, hold on. 7^{1988} is a massive number, but 49 * 7^{1988} is even bigger. But if a, b, c are each at most 7, then each term (a^{1988}) is at most (7^{1988}). So, the maximum sum of three such terms is 3 * 7^{1988}, which is much less than 49 * 7^{1988}. So, that can't be. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the equation.Wait, let me double-check. The original equation is (x^{1988} + y^{1988} + z^{1988} = 7^{1990}). So, 7^{1990} is 7^{1988 + 2} = 7^{1988} * 7^2 = 49 * 7^{1988}. So, the right-hand side is 49 times 7^{1988}. The left-hand side is the sum of three terms, each of which is at most 7^{1988}. So, the maximum possible sum is 3 * 7^{1988}, which is 3 * 7^{1988}. But 49 * 7^{1988} is way bigger than that. So, that suggests that there are no solutions because the left side can't reach the right side.Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, is the answer A. 0? Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider modulo something. Since 1988 is divisible by 4, because 1988 divided by 4 is 497, so yes, 1988 is a multiple of 4. So, maybe I can consider the equation modulo 7 or something.Let me try modulo 7. Let's see, since 7 is a prime, and 1988 is a multiple of 4, which is 4*497. So, 1988 is 0 mod 4. So, perhaps Fermat's little theorem applies here? Wait, Fermat's little theorem says that for a prime p, and integer a not divisible by p, a^{p-1} ≡ 1 mod p. But 1988 is not p-1 for any prime p, unless p is 1989, which is not prime. So, maybe that's not helpful.Alternatively, maybe consider modulo 7^2, which is 49. Let me see. So, 7^{1990} is obviously 0 mod 49. So, the right-hand side is 0 mod 49. So, the left-hand side must also be 0 mod 49. So, (x^{1988} + y^{1988} + z^{1988} equiv 0 mod 49).Now, let's consider each term (x^{1988}) mod 49. Since 49 is 7^2, and 1988 is a multiple of φ(49), where φ is Euler's totient function. φ(49) = 49*(1 - 1/7) = 42. So, 1988 divided by 42 is 47.333... So, 1988 = 42*47 + 14. So, 1988 ≡ 14 mod 42. So, by Euler's theorem, for any x not divisible by 7, x^{42} ≡ 1 mod 49. Therefore, x^{1988} = x^{42*47 + 14} = (x^{42})^{47} * x^{14} ≡ 1^{47} * x^{14} ≡ x^{14} mod 49.So, for x not divisible by 7, x^{1988} ≡ x^{14} mod 49. For x divisible by 7, x^{1988} ≡ 0 mod 49.So, let's consider cases for x, y, z.Case 1: All of x, y, z are divisible by 7. Then, each term is 0 mod 49, so their sum is 0 mod 49, which matches the RHS.Case 2: Exactly two of x, y, z are divisible by 7. Then, the sum would be x^{1988} + 0 + 0 ≡ x^{14} mod 49. But x is not divisible by 7, so x^{14} mod 49 is not 0. Therefore, the sum would be non-zero mod 49, which doesn't match the RHS.Case 3: Exactly one of x, y, z is divisible by 7. Then, the sum would be x^{14} + y^{14} + 0 mod 49. Again, both x and y are not divisible by 7, so their 14th powers mod 49 are non-zero. So, the sum is non-zero mod 49, which doesn't match.Case 4: None of x, y, z are divisible by 7. Then, the sum is x^{14} + y^{14} + z^{14} mod 49. Each term is non-zero, so the sum is non-zero mod 49, which doesn't match.Therefore, the only case where the sum is 0 mod 49 is when all x, y, z are divisible by 7. So, x = 7a, y = 7b, z = 7c, where a, b, c are integers.Substituting back into the original equation:((7a)^{1988} + (7b)^{1988} + (7c)^{1988} = 7^{1990})Simplify:(7^{1988}a^{1988} + 7^{1988}b^{1988} + 7^{1988}c^{1988} = 7^{1990})Factor out (7^{1988}):(7^{1988}(a^{1988} + b^{1988} + c^{1988}) = 7^{1990})Divide both sides by (7^{1988}):(a^{1988} + b^{1988} + c^{1988} = 7^{2} = 49)So, now we have a similar equation but with smaller exponents and a smaller target: (a^{1988} + b^{1988} + c^{1988} = 49), where a, b, c are integers.But 1988 is still a large exponent. Let's see what possible values a, b, c can take.Since 1988 is even, each term is non-negative. So, a, b, c can be any integers such that (|a|^{1988} leq 49). Let's compute the possible values.Compute (k^{1988}) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., until (k^{1988}) exceeds 49.- 0^{1988} = 0- 1^{1988} = 1- 2^{1988}: Hmm, 2^10 is 1024, which is already 1024, so 2^1988 is way larger than 49. Similarly, 3^{1988} is even bigger. So, the only possible values for a, b, c are 0, 1, or -1, because 2^{1988} is way beyond 49.Wait, but 2^{1988} is massive, so any |a| >= 2 would result in (a^{1988}) being way larger than 49. Therefore, the only possible values for a, b, c are -1, 0, or 1.So, now the equation reduces to (a^{1988} + b^{1988} + c^{1988} = 49), where each of a, b, c is -1, 0, or 1.But let's compute the possible sums:Each term can be either 0 or 1, since (-1)^{1988} = 1, and 0^{1988} = 0. So, the sum can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.But the equation requires the sum to be 49, which is way larger than 3. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.Therefore, going back, since a, b, c must be such that their 1988th powers sum to 49, but they can only contribute 0 or 1 each, the maximum sum is 3, which is much less than 49. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for a, b, c, which implies that there are no integer solutions for x, y, z either.Therefore, the number of integer solutions is 0, which is option A.Wait, but hold on. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any possible cases. For example, could a, b, c be larger in absolute value but still have their 1988th power sum to 49? But as I saw earlier, any |a| >= 2 would make (a^{1988}) way larger than 49, so no, that's not possible.Alternatively, maybe considering that 7^{1990} is a multiple of 7^{1988}, but even so, when we scaled down, we still ended up with a sum that was too small. So, yeah, I think 0 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Given an equilateral triangle, what is the ratio of the area of its circumscribed circle to the area of its inscribed circle?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given an equilateral triangle, what is the ratio of the area of its circumscribed circle to the area of its inscribed circle? Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. That should make things symmetric, which might help in calculations. I also recall that both the circumscribed circle (circumcircle) and the inscribed circle (incircle) have their centers at the centroid of the triangle, which is also the center of the triangle.So, maybe I can find the radii of both circles and then compute the areas. Once I have the areas, I can take their ratio. That sounds like a plan.Let me denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as 'a'. Since all sides are equal, this should simplify things.First, I need to find the radius of the circumscribed circle. I think the formula for the radius (R) of the circumcircle of an equilateral triangle is R = a / (√3). Let me verify that.Alternatively, I remember that in any triangle, the radius of the circumcircle can be found using the formula R = (a * b * c) / (4 * area). Since it's an equilateral triangle, a = b = c, so R = (a^3) / (4 * area). But I need to find the area first.Wait, the area (A) of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula A = (√3 / 4) * a^2. So, plugging that into the circumradius formula, R = (a^3) / (4 * (√3 / 4) * a^2). Simplifying that, the 4s cancel out, and one a cancels, so R = a / √3. Okay, so that confirms the first formula. Good.Now, moving on to the radius of the inscribed circle (r). I think the formula for the inradius of an equilateral triangle is r = (a * √3) / 6. Let me see if that makes sense.Alternatively, I remember that the inradius can be found using the formula r = A / s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. For an equilateral triangle, the semi-perimeter (s) is (3a)/2. So, plugging in, r = (√3 / 4 * a^2) / (3a / 2). Let's compute that.First, the area is (√3 / 4) * a^2, and the semi-perimeter is (3a)/2. So, r = (√3 / 4 * a^2) / (3a / 2) = (√3 / 4 * a^2) * (2 / 3a) = (√3 / 4 * 2 / 3) * (a^2 / a) = (√3 / 6) * a. So, r = (a√3)/6. Yep, that matches the formula I remembered. Good.So now, I have R = a / √3 and r = (a√3)/6. Now, I need to find the ratio of the areas of the circumcircle to the incircle.The area of a circle is π times the radius squared. So, the area of the circumcircle is πR², and the area of the incircle is πr². Therefore, the ratio is (πR²) / (πr²) = (R²) / (r²). The π cancels out, so I just need to compute (R / r)².Let me compute R / r first. R is a / √3, and r is (a√3)/6. So, R / r = (a / √3) / (a√3 / 6). Let me simplify this.First, the a's cancel out: (1 / √3) / (√3 / 6). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so this becomes (1 / √3) * (6 / √3) = (6) / (√3 * √3) = 6 / 3 = 2. So, R / r = 2.Therefore, the ratio of the areas is (R / r)² = 2² = 4. So, the area of the circumscribed circle is 4 times the area of the inscribed circle.Wait, that seems a bit large. Let me double-check my calculations.Starting again, R = a / √3, r = (a√3)/6.Compute R / r:(a / √3) divided by (a√3 / 6) = (a / √3) * (6 / a√3) = (6a) / (√3 * a√3) = 6 / (3) = 2. Yeah, that's correct. So, R is twice as long as r.Therefore, since area is proportional to the square of the radius, the ratio is 4:1.Hmm, that seems correct. Let me think about it another way. If the radius is doubled, the area becomes four times as large. So, if the circumradius is twice the inradius, then the area of the circumcircle is four times the area of the incircle.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the areas directly.Area of circumcircle: πR² = π(a / √3)² = π(a² / 3).Area of incircle: πr² = π((a√3)/6)² = π((a² * 3)/36) = π(a² / 12).So, the ratio is (π(a² / 3)) / (π(a² / 12)) = (1/3) / (1/12) = (1/3) * (12/1) = 4. Yep, same result.So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the ratio is 4:1.Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me go through the steps once more.1. Side length of equilateral triangle: a.2. Area of triangle: (√3 / 4) * a².3. Circumradius (R): a / √3.4. Inradius (r): (a√3)/6.5. Area of circumcircle: πR² = π(a² / 3).6. Area of incircle: πr² = π((a√3)/6)² = π(a² * 3 / 36) = π(a² / 12).7. Ratio: (π(a² / 3)) / (π(a² / 12)) = (1/3) / (1/12) = 4.Yes, that's consistent. So, the ratio is 4:1.Alternatively, if I think about the relationship between R and r in an equilateral triangle, I know that R = 2r. Because in an equilateral triangle, the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, so the circumradius is twice the inradius.Therefore, since area is proportional to the square of the radius, the ratio of areas is (2)^2 = 4.So, that's another way to see it.Therefore, I can confidently say that the ratio of the area of the circumscribed circle to the inscribed circle is 4:1.**Final Answer**The ratio is boxed{4}."},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, it is known that a_1 + a_3 = 8 and a_5 + a_7 = 4. Find the value of a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + a_{15}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by a common ratio, which is usually denoted as ( r ). So, the general form of a geometric sequence is ( a_1, a_1 r, a_1 r^2, a_1 r^3, ldots ). That means the ( n )-th term can be written as ( a_n = a_1 r^{n-1} ).The problem says that ( a_1 + a_3 = 8 ) and ( a_5 + a_7 = 4 ). I need to find ( a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + a_{15} ).Let me write down what each of these terms is in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( r ).- ( a_1 ) is just ( a_1 ).- ( a_3 ) is ( a_1 r^{2} ).- ( a_5 ) is ( a_1 r^{4} ).- ( a_7 ) is ( a_1 r^{6} ).- Similarly, ( a_9 = a_1 r^{8} ), ( a_{11} = a_1 r^{10} ), ( a_{13} = a_1 r^{12} ), and ( a_{15} = a_1 r^{14} ).So, the given equations are:1. ( a_1 + a_3 = a_1 + a_1 r^{2} = 8 )2. ( a_5 + a_7 = a_1 r^{4} + a_1 r^{6} = 4 )I can factor out ( a_1 ) from both equations:1. ( a_1 (1 + r^{2}) = 8 )2. ( a_1 r^{4} (1 + r^{2}) = 4 )Hmm, that looks interesting. Both equations have ( a_1 (1 + r^{2}) ) as a factor. Let me denote ( S = a_1 (1 + r^{2}) ). Then, from the first equation, ( S = 8 ). From the second equation, ( S r^{4} = 4 ).So, substituting ( S = 8 ) into the second equation:( 8 r^{4} = 4 )Divide both sides by 8:( r^{4} = frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2} )So, ( r^{4} = frac{1}{2} ). That means ( r^{2} = sqrt{frac{1}{2}} ) or ( r^{2} = -sqrt{frac{1}{2}} ). But since ( r^{2} ) can't be negative (because any real number squared is non-negative), we discard the negative root. So,( r^{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) or ( r^{2} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ).Wait, actually, ( sqrt{frac{1}{2}} ) is equal to ( frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ), so that's correct.But let me write it as ( r^2 = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). Alternatively, ( r^2 = 2^{-1/2} ). Hmm, maybe it's better to write it as ( r^2 = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ). Either way, it's the same.Now, going back to the first equation, ( S = a_1 (1 + r^{2}) = 8 ). Since ( S = 8 ), and ( S = a_1 (1 + r^{2}) ), we can solve for ( a_1 ):( a_1 = frac{8}{1 + r^{2}} )We already know ( r^{2} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ), so let's plug that in:( a_1 = frac{8}{1 + frac{1}{sqrt{2}}} )Let me rationalize the denominator:First, ( 1 + frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{sqrt{2}} )So,( a_1 = frac{8}{frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{sqrt{2}}} = 8 times frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2} + 1} )Multiply numerator and denominator by ( sqrt{2} - 1 ) to rationalize:( a_1 = 8 times frac{sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} - 1)}{(sqrt{2} + 1)(sqrt{2} - 1)} )Simplify the denominator:( (sqrt{2} + 1)(sqrt{2} - 1) = 2 - 1 = 1 )So, the denominator is 1, which is nice.The numerator:( sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} - 1) = 2 - sqrt{2} )Therefore,( a_1 = 8 (2 - sqrt{2}) = 16 - 8 sqrt{2} )Okay, so ( a_1 = 16 - 8 sqrt{2} ).Now, I need to find ( a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + a_{15} ).Let me write each term in terms of ( a_1 ) and ( r ):- ( a_9 = a_1 r^{8} )- ( a_{11} = a_1 r^{10} )- ( a_{13} = a_1 r^{12} )- ( a_{15} = a_1 r^{14} )So, adding them up:( a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + a_{15} = a_1 r^{8} + a_1 r^{10} + a_1 r^{12} + a_1 r^{14} )Factor out ( a_1 r^{8} ):( a_1 r^{8} (1 + r^{2} + r^{4} + r^{6}) )Hmm, so that's ( a_1 r^{8} times (1 + r^{2} + r^{4} + r^{6}) )I can factor this further or perhaps recognize it as a geometric series.Wait, ( 1 + r^{2} + r^{4} + r^{6} ) is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio ( r^{2} ), with 4 terms.The sum of a geometric series is ( S = frac{1 - r^{n}}{1 - r} ), where ( n ) is the number of terms.So, in this case, ( S = frac{1 - (r^{2})^{4}}{1 - r^{2}} = frac{1 - r^{8}}{1 - r^{2}} )But wait, let me check:Wait, actually, the sum of ( 1 + r^{2} + r^{4} + r^{6} ) is indeed ( frac{1 - r^{8}}{1 - r^{2}} ), since each term is multiplied by ( r^{2} ) each time, and there are 4 terms.So, substituting back into the expression:( a_1 r^{8} times frac{1 - r^{8}}{1 - r^{2}} )So, ( a_1 r^{8} times frac{1 - r^{8}}{1 - r^{2}} )But let me compute ( 1 - r^{8} ). Since ( r^{4} = frac{1}{2} ), then ( r^{8} = (r^{4})^{2} = left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 = frac{1}{4} ). So, ( 1 - r^{8} = 1 - frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4} )Similarly, ( 1 - r^{2} = 1 - frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ). Let me compute that:( 1 - frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2} - 1}{sqrt{2}} )So, putting it all together:( a_1 r^{8} times frac{frac{3}{4}}{frac{sqrt{2} - 1}{sqrt{2}}} )Simplify the fraction:( frac{frac{3}{4}}{frac{sqrt{2} - 1}{sqrt{2}}} = frac{3}{4} times frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{2} - 1} = frac{3 sqrt{2}}{4 (sqrt{2} - 1)} )Again, let's rationalize the denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by ( sqrt{2} + 1 ):( frac{3 sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} + 1)}{4 (sqrt{2} - 1)(sqrt{2} + 1)} )Denominator simplifies to ( 4 (2 - 1) = 4 times 1 = 4 )Numerator:( 3 sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} + 1) = 3 (2 + sqrt{2}) = 6 + 3 sqrt{2} )So, the entire expression becomes:( frac{6 + 3 sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{3 (2 + sqrt{2})}{4} )So, now, going back to the expression:( a_1 r^{8} times frac{3 (2 + sqrt{2})}{4} )We already have ( a_1 = 16 - 8 sqrt{2} ) and ( r^{8} = frac{1}{4} ), so let's substitute those in:( (16 - 8 sqrt{2}) times frac{1}{4} times frac{3 (2 + sqrt{2})}{4} )Simplify step by step.First, compute ( (16 - 8 sqrt{2}) times frac{1}{4} ):( frac{16}{4} - frac{8 sqrt{2}}{4} = 4 - 2 sqrt{2} )So, now we have:( (4 - 2 sqrt{2}) times frac{3 (2 + sqrt{2})}{4} )Let me compute ( (4 - 2 sqrt{2}) times (2 + sqrt{2}) ) first, then multiply by ( frac{3}{4} ).Multiply ( (4 - 2 sqrt{2})(2 + sqrt{2}) ):Use the distributive property:( 4 times 2 + 4 times sqrt{2} - 2 sqrt{2} times 2 - 2 sqrt{2} times sqrt{2} )Compute each term:- ( 4 times 2 = 8 )- ( 4 times sqrt{2} = 4 sqrt{2} )- ( -2 sqrt{2} times 2 = -4 sqrt{2} )- ( -2 sqrt{2} times sqrt{2} = -2 times 2 = -4 )Now, add them all together:( 8 + 4 sqrt{2} - 4 sqrt{2} - 4 )Simplify:( (8 - 4) + (4 sqrt{2} - 4 sqrt{2}) = 4 + 0 = 4 )Wow, that simplified nicely to 4.So, ( (4 - 2 sqrt{2})(2 + sqrt{2}) = 4 )Therefore, going back to the expression:( 4 times frac{3}{4} = 3 )So, the entire expression simplifies to 3.Therefore, ( a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + a_{15} = 3 ).Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I found ( r^4 = 1/2 ), so ( r^2 = 1/sqrt{2} ). That seems correct.2. Then, ( a_1 = 8 / (1 + 1/sqrt{2}) ), which I rationalized to ( 16 - 8 sqrt{2} ). Let me verify that:( 1 + 1/sqrt{2} = (sqrt{2} + 1)/sqrt{2} )So, ( 8 / ((sqrt{2} + 1)/sqrt{2}) = 8 sqrt{2} / (sqrt{2} + 1) )Multiply numerator and denominator by ( sqrt{2} - 1 ):( 8 sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} - 1) / ( (sqrt{2} + 1)(sqrt{2} - 1) ) = 8 sqrt{2} (sqrt{2} - 1) / 1 )Which is ( 8 (2 - sqrt{2}) = 16 - 8 sqrt{2} ). Correct.3. Then, for ( a_9 + a_{11} + a_{13} + a_{15} ), I expressed it as ( a_1 r^8 (1 + r^2 + r^4 + r^6) ). That seems right.4. Then, I recognized the sum ( 1 + r^2 + r^4 + r^6 ) as a geometric series with 4 terms, common ratio ( r^2 ), so the sum is ( (1 - r^8)/(1 - r^2) ). Since ( r^8 = (r^4)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 ), so numerator is ( 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 ). Denominator ( 1 - r^2 = 1 - 1/sqrt{2} ), which is ( (sqrt{2} - 1)/sqrt{2} ). So, the ratio is ( (3/4) / ( (sqrt{2} - 1)/sqrt{2} ) = (3 sqrt{2}) / (4 (sqrt{2} - 1)) ). Then, rationalizing gives ( (6 + 3 sqrt{2}) / 4 ). That seems correct.5. Then, ( a_1 r^8 ) is ( (16 - 8 sqrt{2}) times (1/4) = 4 - 2 sqrt{2} ). Correct.6. Then, multiplying ( (4 - 2 sqrt{2}) times (6 + 3 sqrt{2}) / 4 ). Wait, actually, no, I think I messed up a step here. Wait, no, actually, in the previous step, I had:Wait, actually, no, let me go back. After computing the ratio, I had:( a_1 r^8 times frac{3 (2 + sqrt{2})}{4} )But ( a_1 r^8 = (16 - 8 sqrt{2}) times (1/4) = 4 - 2 sqrt{2} ). So, then:( (4 - 2 sqrt{2}) times frac{3 (2 + sqrt{2})}{4} )Which is ( (4 - 2 sqrt{2}) times (2 + sqrt{2}) times frac{3}{4} )Then, I computed ( (4 - 2 sqrt{2})(2 + sqrt{2}) ) as 4, which is correct.So, 4 times ( frac{3}{4} ) is 3. So, yes, the final result is 3.Therefore, I think my steps are correct, and the answer is 3.**Final Answer**boxed{3}"},{"question":"Find the remainder when 12^{2012} is divided by 5.","answer":"To find the remainder when (12^{2012}) is divided by 5, I can use modular arithmetic.First, I simplify the base modulo 5.

There is a pile of 100 stones on the table. The boys take turns making moves, with Kolya going first. On a turn, the player divides a pile that contains more than one stone into two smaller piles. The winner is the one who, after making their move, leaves only piles with one stone each. Can Kolya ensure that he wins regardless of Vitya's moves?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Kolya and Vitya are playing a game with 100 stones. They take turns splitting piles, and the goal is to be the one who leaves only piles with one stone each. Kolya goes first. I need to figure out if Kolya can always win, no matter what Vitya does.Hmm, let me try to understand the game better. So, starting with one pile of 100 stones. Each turn, a player splits a pile into two smaller piles. The game ends when all piles are single stones, and the person who makes that last move wins.Wait, so the game is about splitting piles until you can't split anymore, and the last person to split wins. So it's similar to some kind of impartial game, maybe like Nim or something else.Let me think about smaller numbers to see if I can find a pattern. Maybe if I analyze smaller piles, I can figure out the winning strategy.Let's start with n=1. If there's only one stone, the game is already over, so the player who just moved wins. But in this case, since the game starts with 100, n=1 is the terminal state.For n=2: There's one pile of 2 stones. The first player can split it into two piles of 1 each. Then the game ends, and the first player wins. So n=2 is a winning position.n=3: The first player can split it into 1 and 2. Then the second player can split the pile of 2 into two 1s, winning the game. So n=3 is a losing position for the first player.Wait, is that right? Let me check. If Kolya splits 3 into 1 and 2, then Vitya can split the 2 into two 1s, making all piles single stones, so Vitya wins. So yes, n=3 is a losing position for the first player.n=4: The first player can split into 1 and 3. Then the second player is faced with a pile of 3, which we just saw is a losing position. So if Kolya splits 4 into 1 and 3, Vitya is forced into a losing position, meaning Kolya can win. Alternatively, Kolya could split 4 into 2 and 2. Then Vitya can split one of the 2s into two 1s, leaving piles of 2, 1, 1. Then Kolya can split the remaining 2 into two 1s, winning. Wait, so both splits seem to lead to Kolya winning? Or does it?Wait, if Kolya splits 4 into 2 and 2, Vitya can split one 2 into 1 and 1, leaving piles of 2,1,1. Then it's Kolya's turn, and he can split the remaining 2 into two 1s, making all piles single stones, so Kolya wins. So yes, n=4 is a winning position.Wait, but earlier when n=3, the first player loses. So maybe the losing positions are odd numbers? Let me check n=5.n=5: The first player can split into 1 and 4. Then the second player can split the 4 into 1 and 3, which is a losing position for the first player. Wait, no, if Kolya splits 5 into 1 and 4, Vitya can split 4 into 1 and 3, leaving piles of 1,1,3. Then it's Kolya's turn, and he has to split the 3. If he splits 3 into 1 and 2, Vitya can split the 2 into two 1s, winning. So Kolya would lose. Alternatively, if Kolya splits 5 into 2 and 3. Then Vitya can split the 3 into 1 and 2, leaving piles of 2,1,2. Then Kolya can split one of the 2s into two 1s, leaving 2,1,1,1. Then Vitya splits the remaining 2 into two 1s, winning. So either way, n=5 seems to be a losing position for the first player.Wait, so n=2: win, n=3: lose, n=4: win, n=5: lose. So it seems like even numbers are winning positions, and odd numbers are losing positions? Let me check n=6.n=6: Kolya can split into 1 and 5. Then Vitya is faced with 5, which is a losing position. So Kolya can win. Alternatively, Kolya could split into 3 and 3. Then Vitya can split one 3 into 1 and 2, leaving piles of 3,1,2. Then Kolya can split the remaining 3 into 1 and 2, leaving 1,2,1,2. Then Vitya can split a 2 into two 1s, leaving 1,1,1,2. Then Kolya splits the last 2 into two 1s, winning. So yes, n=6 is a winning position.Wait, but if Kolya splits into 3 and 3, Vitya can choose to split one 3 into 1 and 2, but maybe Kolya can choose a better split. Alternatively, Kolya could split 6 into 2 and 4. Then Vitya can split 4 into 1 and 3, leaving 2,1,3. Then Kolya can split 3 into 1 and 2, leaving 2,1,1,2. Then Vitya splits a 2 into two 1s, leaving 2,1,1,1,1. Then Kolya splits the last 2 into two 1s, winning. So regardless of how Kolya splits, he can force a win. So n=6 is a win.Wait, so the pattern seems to be that even numbers are winning positions, odd numbers are losing positions. Let me check n=7.n=7: If Kolya splits into 1 and 6, Vitya can split 6 into 1 and 5, leaving 1,1,5. Then Kolya is faced with 5, which is a losing position. Alternatively, if Kolya splits 7 into 3 and 4. Then Vitya can split 4 into 1 and 3, leaving 3,1,3. Then Kolya can split a 3 into 1 and 2, leaving 1,2,1,3. Then Vitya can split the 3 into 1 and 2, leaving 1,2,1,1,2. Then Kolya splits a 2 into two 1s, leaving 1,1,1,1,2. Then Vitya splits the last 2 into two 1s, winning. So n=7 is a losing position for Kolya.So it seems like the losing positions are when n is odd, and winning positions when n is even. So starting from 100, which is even, Kolya can win.Wait, but let me think again. Because when n=3, which is odd, the first player loses. n=5, first player loses. n=7, first player loses. So if n is even, first player can win by splitting into 1 and (n-1), which is odd, forcing the second player into a losing position.Wait, but in n=4, splitting into 1 and 3, which is odd, forces the second player into a losing position. Similarly, for n=6, splitting into 1 and 5, which is odd, forces the second player into a losing position.So the strategy is: if you have an even number, split it into 1 and (n-1), which is odd, forcing the opponent into a losing position. If you have an odd number, any split will result in two piles, one of which is even, allowing the opponent to split the even pile into 1 and (even-1), which is odd, and so on.Wait, but in n=3, if the first player splits into 1 and 2, then the second player can split the 2 into two 1s, winning. So for odd n, the first player cannot force a win.Similarly, for n=5, splitting into 1 and 4, then the second player splits 4 into 1 and 3, which is odd, and then the first player is forced to split 3 into 1 and 2, allowing the second player to win.So the key seems to be that even numbers are winning positions, odd numbers are losing positions. Therefore, since 100 is even, Kolya can win by always splitting into 1 and (n-1), forcing Vitya into an odd number, which is a losing position.But wait, let me think about n=4 again. If Kolya splits into 2 and 2, then Vitya can split one 2 into two 1s, leaving 2,1,1. Then Kolya can split the remaining 2 into two 1s, winning. So regardless of how Kolya splits, he can win. So maybe the strategy is more general.Alternatively, maybe the Grundy numbers or Nimbers are involved here. Each pile can be considered as a heap in Nim, and the Grundy number for a pile of size n is the mex (minimum excludant) of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable from n.So let's compute Grundy numbers for small n:n=1: terminal position, Grundy number 0.n=2: can split into (1,1). The Grundy number is mex{Grundy(1)+Grundy(1)} = mex{0+0}=1.n=3: can split into (1,2). Grundy number is mex{Grundy(1)+Grundy(2)} = mex{0+1}=1.Wait, but earlier analysis suggested n=3 is a losing position, which would correspond to Grundy number 0. Hmm, maybe my initial analysis was wrong.Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the game rules. In this game, the last person to move wins, which is a normal play convention. So in normal play, positions with Grundy number 0 are losing positions.So let's recast:n=1: Grundy number 0 (losing).n=2: can split into (1,1). The Grundy number is mex{Grundy(1)+Grundy(1)} = mex{0+0}=1 (winning).n=3: can split into (1,2). The Grundy number is mex{Grundy(1)+Grundy(2)} = mex{0+1}=1 (winning). Wait, but earlier I thought n=3 was losing.Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine n=3.If n=3, Kolya splits into 1 and 2. Then Vitya can split the 2 into two 1s, making all piles single stones, so Vitya wins. So n=3 is a losing position for Kolya, meaning Grundy number 0.But according to the Grundy number calculation, n=3 should have Grundy number 1, which contradicts.Wait, perhaps the Grundy number calculation is incorrect because the game is not equivalent to Nim. In Nim, you can split a heap into any two heaps, but the Grundy number is calculated based on the XOR of the two resulting heaps. Wait, no, in this game, each move is splitting one heap into two, so the Grundy number for a heap of size n is the mex of the Grundy numbers of all possible splits.Wait, let's clarify. For a heap of size n, the possible moves are to split it into two heaps of sizes a and b, where a + b = n and a, b >=1. The Grundy number G(n) is the mex of all possible G(a) XOR G(b) for all a + b = n.Wait, no, in standard impartial games, when you split a heap into two, the Grundy number is the mex of the XOR of the Grundy numbers of the resulting heaps. So for each possible split into a and b, compute G(a) XOR G(b), then take the mex of all those values to get G(n).Wait, let me try that.n=1: G(1)=0.n=2: can split into (1,1). So G(1) XOR G(1) = 0 XOR 0 = 0. So mex{0} = 1. So G(2)=1.n=3: can split into (1,2). So G(1) XOR G(2) = 0 XOR 1 = 1. So mex{1} = 0. So G(3)=0.n=4: can split into (1,3) and (2,2).For (1,3): G(1) XOR G(3) = 0 XOR 0 = 0.For (2,2): G(2) XOR G(2) = 1 XOR 1 = 0.So mex{0,0}=1. So G(4)=1.n=5: can split into (1,4), (2,3).For (1,4): G(1) XOR G(4) = 0 XOR 1 = 1.For (2,3): G(2) XOR G(3) = 1 XOR 0 = 1.So mex{1,1}=0. So G(5)=0.n=6: can split into (1,5), (2,4), (3,3).For (1,5): G(1) XOR G(5)=0 XOR 0=0.For (2,4): G(2) XOR G(4)=1 XOR 1=0.For (3,3): G(3) XOR G(3)=0 XOR 0=0.So mex{0,0,0}=1. So G(6)=1.n=7: can split into (1,6), (2,5), (3,4).For (1,6): G(1) XOR G(6)=0 XOR 1=1.For (2,5): G(2) XOR G(5)=1 XOR 0=1.For (3,4): G(3) XOR G(4)=0 XOR 1=1.So mex{1,1,1}=0. So G(7)=0.So the pattern is G(n)=0 when n is odd, and G(n)=1 when n is even.Therefore, the Grundy number for a heap of size n is 0 if n is odd, and 1 if n is even.So in this game, the Grundy number is 1 for even n, 0 for odd n.Therefore, the initial heap of 100 stones has G(100)=1, which is a winning position for the first player, Kolya.Therefore, Kolya can always win by making the right moves.But wait, let me think about how exactly Kolya can enforce the win. Since the Grundy number is 1, which is non-zero, it's a winning position. So Kolya can make a move that leads to a position with Grundy number 0.Given that the Grundy number is 1 for even n, Kolya needs to split 100 into two heaps whose Grundy numbers XOR to 0. Since G(100)=1, he needs to split it into two heaps where G(a) XOR G(b)=0, which means G(a)=G(b).Since G(n)=0 for odd n, and G(n)=1 for even n, Kolya can split 100 into two even heaps, because then G(a)=1 and G(b)=1, so G(a) XOR G(b)=0.Alternatively, he can split it into one odd and one odd heap, but 100 is even, so splitting into two odds would require both a and b to be odd, which is possible only if 100 is even, which it is. For example, 99 and 1, both odd.Wait, but if he splits into two odd heaps, then each has G=0, so G(a) XOR G(b)=0 XOR 0=0, which is a losing position for Vitya.Alternatively, if he splits into two even heaps, each with G=1, so G(a) XOR G(b)=1 XOR 1=0, also a losing position for Vitya.So either way, Kolya can split 100 into two heaps, both even or both odd, leading to a position with Grundy number 0, which is a losing position for Vitya.Therefore, Kolya can ensure victory by making such a split on his first move.So, in conclusion, yes, Kolya can ensure he wins regardless of Vitya's moves."},{"question":"Use the Horner's method to calculate the value of the polynomial f(x) = x^5 + 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 7x^2 - 9x + 11 when x = 4.","answer":"Okay, so I need to calculate the value of the polynomial ( f(x) = x^5 + 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 7x^2 - 9x + 11 ) when ( x = 4 ) using Horner's method. Hmm, I remember Horner's method is a way to evaluate polynomials more efficiently by reducing the number of multiplications. Let me try to recall how it works.First, I think Horner's method involves rewriting the polynomial in a nested form. So instead of computing each term separately, we can factor out the x step by step. For a polynomial like ( f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + dots + a_1x + a_0 ), Horner's method would express it as ( f(x) = (...((a_nx + a_{n-1})x + a_{n-2})x + ...)x + a_0 ). That way, each step only requires one multiplication and one addition, which is more efficient.Let me write down the given polynomial and its coefficients:( f(x) = x^5 + 3x^4 - 5x^3 + 7x^2 - 9x + 11 )So, the coefficients are: 1 (for ( x^5 )), 3 (for ( x^4 )), -5 (for ( x^3 )), 7 (for ( x^2 )), -9 (for ( x )), and 11 (constant term). Since we're evaluating at ( x = 4 ), we can set up the Horner's method computation step by step. I think we start with the leading coefficient and then multiply by x and add the next coefficient, repeating this process until we reach the constant term.Let me list the coefficients in order: 1, 3, -5, 7, -9, 11.Starting with the leading coefficient, which is 1.Step 1: Multiply by x (which is 4) and add the next coefficient.So, 1 * 4 = 4. Then, 4 + 3 = 7.Step 2: Take the result (7), multiply by x (4), and add the next coefficient (-5).7 * 4 = 28. Then, 28 + (-5) = 23.Step 3: Take 23, multiply by 4, add the next coefficient (7).23 * 4 = 92. 92 + 7 = 99.Step 4: Take 99, multiply by 4, add the next coefficient (-9).99 * 4 = 396. 396 + (-9) = 387.Step 5: Take 387, multiply by 4, add the last coefficient (11).387 * 4 = 1548. 1548 + 11 = 1559.So, according to these steps, the value of the polynomial at x = 4 is 1559.Wait, let me verify this because sometimes I might make a multiplication error. Let me go through each step again.Starting with 1.1 * 4 = 4. 4 + 3 = 7. That's correct.7 * 4 = 28. 28 + (-5) = 23. Still correct.23 * 4 = 92. 92 + 7 = 99. Right.99 * 4 = 396. 396 + (-9) = 387. Correct.387 * 4 = 1548. 1548 + 11 = 1559. Hmm, seems consistent.But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the polynomial the standard way and see if I get the same result.Compute each term:( x^5 = 4^5 = 1024 )( 3x^4 = 3*(4^4) = 3*256 = 768 )( -5x^3 = -5*(4^3) = -5*64 = -320 )( 7x^2 = 7*(4^2) = 7*16 = 112 )( -9x = -9*4 = -36 )( 11 ) is just 11.Now, add all these together:1024 + 768 = 17921792 - 320 = 14721472 + 112 = 15841584 - 36 = 15481548 + 11 = 1559.Wait, that's the same result as Horner's method. So, 1559 is correct.I think I did it right both ways, so I can be confident that the value is indeed 1559.**Final Answer**The value of the polynomial at ( x = 4 ) is boxed{1559}."},{"question":"Let M be a non-empty set, M subseteq {1, 2, 3}, and M contains at least one odd number.

Since each element can either be included or excluded, there are ( 2^3 = 8 ) total subsets, including the empty set. Excluding the empty set, there are ( 8 - 1 = 7 ) non-empty subsets.Next, identify the subsets that do not contain any odd numbers. The even numbers in the set are ({2}). The subsets of ({2}) are the empty set and ({2}). Excluding the empty set, there is only ( 1 ) non-empty subset without any odd numbers.Finally, subtract the number of subsets without odd numbers from the total number of non-empty subsets to find the number of subsets that contain at least one odd number: ( 7 - 1 = 6 )."},{"question":"As shown in the figure, five circles are each tangent to lines ( L_{1} ) and ( L_{2} ) and are sequentially tangent to each other. If the radius of the largest circle is 18 and the radius of the smallest circle is 8, what is the radius of the middle circle?(A) 12(B) 12.5(C) 13(D) 13.5(E) 14","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem with five circles, each tangent to two lines, L1 and L2, and they're also sequentially tangent to each other. The largest circle has a radius of 18, and the smallest one is 8. I need to find the radius of the middle circle. The options are 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, and 14. Hmm, okay.First, I should visualize the figure. There are two lines, L1 and L2, which are probably intersecting at some angle, forming a sort of angle between them. The circles are each tangent to both lines, so they must be inscribed within that angle. Also, they're sequentially tangent to each other, meaning each circle is tangent to the next one in the sequence. So, starting from the largest circle, which is radius 18, then the next one is smaller, and so on until the smallest, which is radius 8.Since all the circles are tangent to both lines, they must all lie along the angle bisector of L1 and L2. That makes sense because the center of each circle has to be equidistant from both lines, which is the definition of the angle bisector. So, all the centers lie on this bisector.Now, because the circles are sequentially tangent, the distance between the centers of two consecutive circles should be equal to the sum of their radii. That's a key point. So, if I denote the radii of the five circles as r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, where r1 = 18 and r5 = 8, then the distance between the centers of r1 and r2 is r1 + r2, between r2 and r3 is r2 + r3, and so on.But wait, the centers are also lying along the angle bisector. So, the distance between centers isn't just the sum of radii; it's also related to the angle between L1 and L2. Hmm, maybe I need to consider similar triangles or something like that.Let me think. If I consider the angle between L1 and L2, say θ, then the distance from the vertex of the angle to each center can be related to the radius of each circle. The distance from the vertex to the center of a circle with radius r is d = r / sin(θ/2). I remember this formula from some geometry problems before. So, each center is located at a distance of d_i = r_i / sin(θ/2) from the vertex.Therefore, the distance between two consecutive centers, say between r_i and r_{i+1}, would be |d_i - d_{i+1}|. But since the circles are sequentially tangent, this distance should also equal r_i + r_{i+1}. So, putting these together:|d_i - d_{i+1}| = r_i + r_{i+1}But since the circles are getting smaller, each subsequent center is closer to the vertex. So, d_i > d_{i+1}, meaning d_i - d_{i+1} = r_i + r_{i+1}.Substituting d_i = r_i / sin(θ/2):(r_i / sin(θ/2)) - (r_{i+1} / sin(θ/2)) = r_i + r_{i+1}Factor out 1 / sin(θ/2):(r_i - r_{i+1}) / sin(θ/2) = r_i + r_{i+1}Let me rearrange this equation:(r_i - r_{i+1}) = (r_i + r_{i+1}) * sin(θ/2)Hmm, so this gives a relationship between consecutive radii and the angle θ. Maybe I can denote k = sin(θ/2), so the equation becomes:r_i - r_{i+1} = k (r_i + r_{i+1})Let me solve for k:k = (r_i - r_{i+1}) / (r_i + r_{i+1})So, k is a constant for all consecutive circles because the angle θ is fixed. Therefore, the ratio (r_i - r_{i+1}) / (r_i + r_{i+1}) is the same for each pair of consecutive circles.That means the sequence of radii forms a geometric progression? Or maybe something else. Let me check.Suppose we have five circles, so four intervals between them. Let me denote the radii as r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, with r1 = 18 and r5 = 8.Given that the ratio (r_i - r_{i+1}) / (r_i + r_{i+1}) is constant, let's denote this ratio as k. So, for each i from 1 to 4:(r_i - r_{i+1}) = k (r_i + r_{i+1})So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me solve it.Let me rearrange the equation:r_i - r_{i+1} = k r_i + k r_{i+1}Bring all terms to one side:r_i - k r_i - r_{i+1} - k r_{i+1} = 0Factor:r_i (1 - k) - r_{i+1} (1 + k) = 0So,r_i (1 - k) = r_{i+1} (1 + k)Therefore,r_{i+1} = r_i * (1 - k) / (1 + k)So, each subsequent radius is a multiple of the previous one by a factor of (1 - k)/(1 + k). Let me denote this factor as q, so q = (1 - k)/(1 + k). Then,r_{i+1} = q r_iSo, the radii form a geometric sequence with common ratio q.Therefore, starting from r1 = 18, we have:r2 = q r1r3 = q r2 = q^2 r1r4 = q r3 = q^3 r1r5 = q r4 = q^4 r1But we know that r5 = 8, so:q^4 r1 = 8Given that r1 = 18,q^4 * 18 = 8So,q^4 = 8 / 18 = 4 / 9Therefore,q = (4/9)^{1/4}Let me compute that. 4/9 is (2/3)^2, so (4/9)^{1/4} = (2/3)^{1/2} = sqrt(2/3). Wait, is that correct?Wait, (4/9)^{1/4} = ( (2^2)/(3^2) )^{1/4} = (2/3)^{2*(1/4)} = (2/3)^{1/2} = sqrt(2/3). Yes, that's correct.So, q = sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.8165.But let me keep it as sqrt(2/3) for exactness.Therefore, the radii are:r1 = 18r2 = 18 * sqrt(2/3)r3 = 18 * (sqrt(2/3))^2 = 18 * (2/3) = 12r4 = 18 * (sqrt(2/3))^3r5 = 18 * (sqrt(2/3))^4 = 18 * (4/9) = 8Wait, so r3 is 12? That's one of the options, option A. But the question asks for the radius of the middle circle, which is r3. So, is it 12? But hold on, let me verify.Wait, let me compute r2 and r4 to make sure.r2 = 18 * sqrt(2/3) ≈ 18 * 0.8165 ≈ 14.696r4 = 18 * (sqrt(2/3))^3 = 18 * (2/3) * sqrt(2/3) ≈ 18 * (0.6667) * 0.8165 ≈ 18 * 0.5443 ≈ 9.797So, the radii are approximately:18, 14.7, 12, 9.8, 8.So, the middle one is 12, which is option A.But wait, the options include 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14. So, 12 is an option, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake because 12 seems straightforward, but the problem is structured with five circles, so perhaps it's a different progression.Wait, let me think again. Maybe I oversimplified.I assumed that the ratio k is constant, which led me to a geometric progression. But is that the case?Wait, the key was that (r_i - r_{i+1}) / (r_i + r_{i+1}) is constant, which is k = sin(theta/2). So, that ratio is constant, which does lead to a geometric progression.Therefore, the radii are in geometric progression with ratio q = (1 - k)/(1 + k). So, that seems correct.Given that, since r5 = q^4 r1, we found q = (4/9)^{1/4} = sqrt(2/3). Therefore, r3 = q^2 r1 = (2/3) * 18 = 12. So, that should be correct.But wait, let me verify with another approach.Alternatively, perhaps using Descartes' Circle Theorem? But that's usually for mutually tangent circles, not necessarily in a line. Hmm, maybe not applicable here.Alternatively, maybe considering similar triangles.Since each circle is tangent to both lines, the distance from the vertex to each center is d_i = r_i / sin(theta/2). So, the distance between centers is d_i - d_{i+1} = (r_i - r_{i+1}) / sin(theta/2). But since the circles are tangent, the distance between centers is r_i + r_{i+1}. Therefore,(r_i - r_{i+1}) / sin(theta/2) = r_i + r_{i+1}Which is the same equation as before, leading to k = sin(theta/2) = (r_i - r_{i+1}) / (r_i + r_{i+1})So, same conclusion.Therefore, the radii form a geometric progression with ratio q = (1 - k)/(1 + k). So, with four steps from r1 to r5, q^4 = 8/18 = 4/9, so q = (4/9)^{1/4} = sqrt(2/3). Therefore, r3 = q^2 * r1 = (2/3)*18 = 12.So, yeah, 12 is the answer, which is option A.But wait, the options are (A) 12, (B) 12.5, (C) 13, (D) 13.5, (E) 14. So, 12 is an option, but I thought maybe it's more complicated.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the ratio is the same for each step? Let me check.If I have five circles, each tangent to the lines and each tangent to the next, then the ratio between consecutive radii is constant. So, it's a geometric progression.Given that, with r1 = 18, r5 = 8, and four intervals, so q^4 = 8/18 = 4/9, so q = (4/9)^(1/4). So, q is the fourth root of 4/9.But 4/9 is (2/3)^2, so the fourth root is sqrt(2/3). So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, the radii are:r1 = 18r2 = 18 * sqrt(2/3)r3 = 18 * (2/3)r4 = 18 * (2/3) * sqrt(2/3)r5 = 18 * (4/9) = 8So, r3 is indeed 12.Therefore, the answer is 12, which is option A.But wait, in the options, 12 is A, but the problem is from an Olympiad, so maybe it's more tricky. Let me think again.Wait, is the progression geometric? Because each step, the ratio is (1 - k)/(1 + k), which is a constant, so yes, it's a geometric progression.Alternatively, maybe the radii form an arithmetic progression? But no, because the ratio is constant, not the difference.Wait, if it were arithmetic, then the difference between radii would be constant, but in this case, the ratio (r_i - r_{i+1}) / (r_i + r_{i+1}) is constant, which is different.So, unless I made a miscalculation, it seems that 12 is correct.Wait, let me compute the exact value of r3.Given that q = sqrt(2/3), so q squared is 2/3.Therefore, r3 = r1 * q^2 = 18 * (2/3) = 12. So, yes, 12 is exact.Therefore, the radius of the middle circle is 12, which is option A.But wait, I just realized that the problem says \\"five circles are each tangent to lines L1 and L2 and are sequentially tangent to each other.\\" So, does that mean that each circle is tangent to both lines and also tangent to the previous and next circle? So, in that case, the first circle is tangent to L1, L2, and the second circle; the second is tangent to L1, L2, first, and third; and so on.But in my previous reasoning, I considered that the distance between centers is r_i + r_{i+1}, but actually, each circle is tangent to both lines and the adjacent circles. So, is there a different relationship?Wait, maybe my initial assumption is correct because the distance between centers is still the sum of radii since they are tangent. The fact that they are also tangent to the lines doesn't affect the distance between centers; it just constrains their positions along the angle bisector.Therefore, my previous reasoning should still hold.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the curvatures. In some problems, curvature is defined as 1/radius, and if circles are tangent, their curvatures satisfy certain relations. But in this case, since all circles are tangent to two lines, it's more about similar triangles.Wait, another approach: Let's consider the homothety that maps the largest circle to the smallest circle. A homothety is a transformation that scales objects about a point. Since all circles are tangent to the same two lines, the homothety center is the intersection point of L1 and L2.So, the homothety that maps the largest circle (radius 18) to the smallest circle (radius 8) will have a scale factor of 8/18 = 4/9. The homothety center is the vertex where L1 and L2 meet.Since there are five circles, the homothety maps each circle to the next one. So, the scale factor between consecutive circles is (4/9)^{1/4}, because after four applications, it goes from 18 to 8.Therefore, the radii form a geometric progression with ratio (4/9)^{1/4} = sqrt(2/3), as before. So, the middle circle, which is the third one, has radius 18 * (sqrt(2/3))^2 = 18 * (2/3) = 12.So, again, 12 is the answer.Therefore, I think 12 is correct, which is option A.But wait, just to make sure, let me compute the radii step by step.Given r1 = 18.r2 = r1 * sqrt(2/3) ≈ 18 * 0.8165 ≈ 14.696r3 = r2 * sqrt(2/3) ≈ 14.696 * 0.8165 ≈ 12r4 = r3 * sqrt(2/3) ≈ 12 * 0.8165 ≈ 9.797r5 = r4 * sqrt(2/3) ≈ 9.797 * 0.8165 ≈ 8So, yes, r5 is approximately 8, which matches the given. So, the progression is correct.Therefore, the middle circle, r3, is exactly 12.So, the answer is 12, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Find the solution to the equation ( y'' = 2 ), satisfying the following initial conditions: ( y = 1 ) and ( y' = 2 ) at ( x = 0 ).","answer":"Okay, so I need to solve this differential equation ( y'' = 2 ) with the initial conditions ( y(0) = 1 ) and ( y'(0) = 2 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with second-order differential equations, I usually need to integrate twice to find the general solution. Since ( y'' = 2 ) is a constant, integrating once should give me ( y' ), and integrating again will give me ( y ).Let me start by integrating ( y'' = 2 ) with respect to ( x ). So, the first integration should be:( y' = int 2 , dx )Integrating 2 with respect to ( x ) gives ( 2x + C ), where ( C ) is the constant of integration. So, ( y' = 2x + C ).Now, I have the expression for ( y' ), but I need to find ( y ). So, I'll integrate ( y' ) again:( y = int (2x + C) , dx )Let me compute that integral step by step. The integral of ( 2x ) is ( x^2 ), and the integral of ( C ) with respect to ( x ) is ( Cx ). So, putting it together, I get:( y = x^2 + Cx + D )Where ( D ) is another constant of integration. So, now I have the general solution: ( y = x^2 + Cx + D ).But I need to find the specific solution that satisfies the initial conditions ( y(0) = 1 ) and ( y'(0) = 2 ). Let me apply these conditions one by one.First, let's find ( y(0) ). Plugging ( x = 0 ) into the general solution:( y(0) = (0)^2 + C(0) + D = D )But we know ( y(0) = 1 ), so that means ( D = 1 ). Great, so now the solution becomes:( y = x^2 + Cx + 1 )Next, let's find ( y'(0) ). I already have ( y' = 2x + C ) from earlier. Plugging ( x = 0 ) into this:( y'(0) = 2(0) + C = C )We are given that ( y'(0) = 2 ), so that means ( C = 2 ). Perfect, so now plugging ( C = 2 ) back into the solution:( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 )Hmm, let me double-check to make sure this satisfies both the differential equation and the initial conditions.First, let's compute ( y'' ). Starting from ( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 ), the first derivative is ( y' = 2x + 2 ), and the second derivative is ( y'' = 2 ). That's exactly the differential equation given, so that checks out.Now, checking the initial conditions. At ( x = 0 ):( y(0) = (0)^2 + 2(0) + 1 = 1 ), which matches.And ( y'(0) = 2(0) + 2 = 2 ), which also matches.So, it seems like everything works out. Therefore, the specific solution is ( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 ).Wait a second, that looks familiar. ( x^2 + 2x + 1 ) is a perfect square. It can be written as ( (x + 1)^2 ). Let me confirm that:( (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 ). Yep, that's correct. So, another way to write the solution is ( y = (x + 1)^2 ). That might be a more compact way to express it.But both forms are correct, so depending on what's preferred, either is acceptable. Since the problem didn't specify a particular form, both are fine.Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:1. Start with ( y'' = 2 ).2. Integrate once to get ( y' = 2x + C ).3. Integrate again to get ( y = x^2 + Cx + D ).4. Apply initial conditions:   - ( y(0) = 1 ) gives ( D = 1 ).   - ( y'(0) = 2 ) gives ( C = 2 ).5. Substitute ( C ) and ( D ) back into the general solution to get ( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 ).6. Verify by computing ( y'' ) and checking initial conditions.Everything seems to line up. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients, so the process is pretty standard.Just to visualize, the solution ( y = (x + 1)^2 ) is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at ( (-1, 0) ). At ( x = 0 ), it's at ( y = 1 ), which matches the initial condition. The slope at ( x = 0 ) is 2, which is also given. So, the graph makes sense too.I think I'm confident that this is the correct solution. No steps seem missing or incorrectly applied.**Final Answer**The solution to the differential equation is boxed{(x + 1)^2}."},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_1=1, and a_4=8, then a_7= _________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me see. It says that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, the first term a₁ is 1, and the fourth term a₄ is 8. I need to find the seventh term, a₇. Hmm, okay.First, let me remember what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a₁ * r^(n-1). Yeah, that sounds right.Given that a₁ is 1, so the first term is 1. Then, a₄ is 8. Let me write that down. So, a₄ = a₁ * r^(4-1) = 1 * r³ = r³. And they say a₄ is 8, so that means r³ = 8. Okay, so if r³ is 8, then r must be the cube root of 8. What's the cube root of 8? Well, 2 * 2 * 2 is 8, so r is 2. Got it.So, the common ratio r is 2. Now, I need to find a₇. Using the same formula, a₇ = a₁ * r^(7-1) = 1 * r⁶. Since r is 2, that's 2⁶. Let me calculate 2⁶. 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, and 2^6 is 64. So, a₇ is 64.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with a₁ = 1, then a₄ = 8. So, a₄ = a₁ * r³ = 8. So, 1 * r³ = 8, so r³ = 8, which gives r = 2. Then, a₇ = a₁ * r⁶ = 1 * 2⁶ = 64. Yeah, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think about how each term is multiplied by 2 each time. So, starting from a₁ = 1, then a₂ = 1 * 2 = 2, a₃ = 2 * 2 = 4, a₄ = 4 * 2 = 8. Yep, that's consistent with what they gave. Then, a₅ = 8 * 2 = 16, a₆ = 16 * 2 = 32, and a₇ = 32 * 2 = 64. So, same result. That makes me more confident that 64 is the right answer.I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward. The key was recognizing that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by the common ratio, so finding r was essential. Once I had r, I could just apply the formula for the seventh term.Just to recap: a₁ = 1, a₄ = 8. So, using the formula, I found r³ = 8, so r = 2. Then, using r = 2, I found a₇ = 2⁶ = 64. Yep, that all lines up.I guess another way to think about it is that the terms are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,... So, the seventh term is 64. Yep, that's consistent.I don't think I need to consider any other possibilities here. Since it's a geometric sequence, the ratio is constant, so once I found r, it's just a matter of applying it each time. I don't see any alternative interpretations of the problem that would lead to a different answer.So, yeah, I think I'm confident that a₇ is 64.**Final Answer**The seventh term is boxed{64}."},{"question":"Given that -4leq xleq-2 and 2leq yleq4, what is the largest possible value of frac{x+y}{x}?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that ( -4 leq x leq -2 ) and ( 2 leq y leq 4 ), what is the largest possible value of ( frac{x + y}{x} ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what the expression ( frac{x + y}{x} ) represents. Maybe I can simplify it or rewrite it in a way that makes it easier to analyze. Let me try that.So, ( frac{x + y}{x} ) can be split into two fractions: ( frac{x}{x} + frac{y}{x} ). Simplifying that, it becomes ( 1 + frac{y}{x} ). Okay, so now the expression is ( 1 + frac{y}{x} ). That might be easier to work with.Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression given the ranges of ( x ) and ( y ). Since both ( x ) and ( y ) have ranges, I should consider how each variable affects the expression.Let me think about ( frac{y}{x} ). Since ( x ) is negative (because ( -4 leq x leq -2 )) and ( y ) is positive (because ( 2 leq y leq 4 )), the fraction ( frac{y}{x} ) will be negative. That means ( frac{y}{x} ) is a negative number, so adding it to 1 will make the entire expression less than 1. So, the expression ( 1 + frac{y}{x} ) is less than 1.Wait, so if I need the largest possible value of this expression, which is less than 1, I need to make ( frac{y}{x} ) as close to 0 as possible from the negative side. Because adding a number close to 0 (but negative) to 1 will give a value close to 1, which is the largest possible value.Alternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. Let me consider the expression ( frac{x + y}{x} ). Since ( x ) is negative, the sign of the entire fraction will depend on the numerator. Let's see: ( x + y ). Since ( x ) is negative and ( y ) is positive, ( x + y ) could be positive or negative depending on the magnitudes of ( x ) and ( y ).Wait, actually, ( x ) is between -4 and -2, and ( y ) is between 2 and 4. So, let's see the possible values of ( x + y ). The smallest ( x + y ) can be is when ( x ) is at its minimum and ( y ) is at its minimum: ( -4 + 2 = -2 ). The largest ( x + y ) can be is when ( x ) is at its maximum and ( y ) is at its maximum: ( -2 + 4 = 2 ). So, ( x + y ) can range from -2 to 2.But since ( x ) is negative, the fraction ( frac{x + y}{x} ) can be positive or negative. Let me see:If ( x + y ) is positive, then ( frac{x + y}{x} ) is negative because ( x ) is negative.If ( x + y ) is negative, then ( frac{x + y}{x} ) is positive because both numerator and denominator are negative.Wait, that's interesting. So, depending on whether ( x + y ) is positive or negative, the expression can be negative or positive. So, to find the maximum value, I need to see whether the positive or negative case gives a larger value.But since positive numbers are larger than negative numbers, if ( frac{x + y}{x} ) can be positive, then the maximum value will come from the positive case. So, I need to find when ( x + y ) is negative because that will make the fraction positive.So, when is ( x + y ) negative? When ( y < -x ). Since ( x ) is negative, ( -x ) is positive. So, ( y < -x ) implies that ( y ) is less than the absolute value of ( x ). Given that ( y ) is between 2 and 4, and ( -x ) is between 2 and 4 as well (since ( x ) is between -4 and -2). So, ( y ) can be less than or equal to ( -x ) or greater than ( -x ).Wait, so if ( y ) is less than ( -x ), then ( x + y ) is negative, and ( frac{x + y}{x} ) is positive. If ( y ) is greater than ( -x ), then ( x + y ) is positive, and ( frac{x + y}{x} ) is negative.Therefore, to get the maximum value of ( frac{x + y}{x} ), we need to maximize the positive case, which occurs when ( x + y ) is as negative as possible (since dividing by a negative ( x ) would flip the sign and make it positive). Alternatively, maybe I need to think about how to maximize ( frac{x + y}{x} ).Let me consider the expression ( frac{x + y}{x} = 1 + frac{y}{x} ). Since ( x ) is negative, ( frac{y}{x} ) is negative. So, ( 1 + frac{y}{x} ) is less than 1. To maximize this expression, I need to minimize the magnitude of ( frac{y}{x} ), i.e., make ( frac{y}{x} ) as close to zero as possible from the negative side.So, ( frac{y}{x} ) is minimized in magnitude when ( y ) is as small as possible and ( x ) is as large as possible in magnitude (i.e., as negative as possible). Wait, no, actually, ( frac{y}{x} ) is equal to ( -frac{y}{|x|} ). So, to minimize the magnitude, we need to minimize ( frac{y}{|x|} ). That occurs when ( y ) is as small as possible and ( |x| ) is as large as possible.So, ( y ) is minimized at 2, and ( |x| ) is maximized at 4. Therefore, ( frac{y}{|x|} ) is minimized at ( frac{2}{4} = 0.5 ). Therefore, ( frac{y}{x} = -0.5 ), so ( 1 + frac{y}{x} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 ).Wait, but is that the maximum? Let me check another point. Suppose ( y ) is 4 and ( x ) is -2. Then ( frac{y}{x} = frac{4}{-2} = -2 ), so ( 1 + (-2) = -1 ). That's less than 0.5.Alternatively, if ( y ) is 2 and ( x ) is -2, then ( frac{y}{x} = frac{2}{-2} = -1 ), so ( 1 + (-1) = 0 ). That's less than 0.5.If ( y ) is 4 and ( x ) is -4, then ( frac{y}{x} = frac{4}{-4} = -1 ), so ( 1 + (-1) = 0 ). Still less than 0.5.Wait, so when ( y ) is 2 and ( x ) is -4, ( frac{y}{x} = frac{2}{-4} = -0.5 ), so ( 1 + (-0.5) = 0.5 ). That seems to be the maximum.But let me think again. Maybe I should approach this using calculus or some optimization technique. Since ( x ) and ( y ) are within intervals, the maximum of the function ( f(x, y) = frac{x + y}{x} ) will occur at one of the endpoints of the intervals.So, let's consider the four corner points of the domain defined by ( x ) and ( y ):1. ( x = -4 ), ( y = 2 )2. ( x = -4 ), ( y = 4 )3. ( x = -2 ), ( y = 2 )4. ( x = -2 ), ( y = 4 )Let me compute ( f(x, y) ) at each of these points.1. ( f(-4, 2) = frac{-4 + 2}{-4} = frac{-2}{-4} = 0.5 )2. ( f(-4, 4) = frac{-4 + 4}{-4} = frac{0}{-4} = 0 )3. ( f(-2, 2) = frac{-2 + 2}{-2} = frac{0}{-2} = 0 )4. ( f(-2, 4) = frac{-2 + 4}{-2} = frac{2}{-2} = -1 )So, among these four points, the maximum value is 0.5 at the point ( (-4, 2) ).But wait, is that the only possibility? What if the maximum occurs somewhere inside the domain, not necessarily at the corners? Let me check.To do that, I can consider the function ( f(x, y) = frac{x + y}{x} = 1 + frac{y}{x} ). Let's see if this function has any critical points inside the domain.First, let's compute the partial derivatives.The partial derivative with respect to ( x ):( frac{partial f}{partial x} = frac{d}{dx}left(1 + frac{y}{x}right) = 0 + left(-frac{y}{x^2}right) = -frac{y}{x^2} )The partial derivative with respect to ( y ):( frac{partial f}{partial y} = frac{d}{dy}left(1 + frac{y}{x}right) = 0 + frac{1}{x} = frac{1}{x} )To find critical points, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero.So,1. ( -frac{y}{x^2} = 0 )2. ( frac{1}{x} = 0 )Looking at equation 2: ( frac{1}{x} = 0 ). This equation has no solution because ( frac{1}{x} ) can never be zero for any finite ( x ). Therefore, there are no critical points inside the domain. That means the maximum must occur on the boundary of the domain.Since the maximum occurs on the boundary, and we've already evaluated the function at all four corners, which gave us the maximum value of 0.5, that must be the maximum.Alternatively, I can also consider the edges of the domain.Let me check the edges:1. Edge where ( x = -4 ), ( y ) varies from 2 to 4.2. Edge where ( x = -2 ), ( y ) varies from 2 to 4.3. Edge where ( y = 2 ), ( x ) varies from -4 to -2.4. Edge where ( y = 4 ), ( x ) varies from -4 to -2.For each edge, I can express ( f(x, y) ) as a function of a single variable and find its maximum.Starting with edge 1: ( x = -4 ), ( y ) from 2 to 4.( f(-4, y) = frac{-4 + y}{-4} = frac{y - 4}{-4} = frac{4 - y}{4} = 1 - frac{y}{4} )This is a linear function in ( y ) with a negative slope, so it's decreasing as ( y ) increases. Therefore, the maximum occurs at ( y = 2 ):( f(-4, 2) = 1 - frac{2}{4} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 )Edge 2: ( x = -2 ), ( y ) from 2 to 4.( f(-2, y) = frac{-2 + y}{-2} = frac{y - 2}{-2} = frac{2 - y}{2} = 1 - frac{y}{2} )Again, linear in ( y ) with a negative slope. Maximum at ( y = 2 ):( f(-2, 2) = 1 - frac{2}{2} = 1 - 1 = 0 )Edge 3: ( y = 2 ), ( x ) from -4 to -2.( f(x, 2) = frac{x + 2}{x} = 1 + frac{2}{x} )Since ( x ) is negative, ( frac{2}{x} ) is negative. Let's see how this function behaves as ( x ) increases from -4 to -2.At ( x = -4 ): ( 1 + frac{2}{-4} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 )At ( x = -2 ): ( 1 + frac{2}{-2} = 1 - 1 = 0 )So, as ( x ) increases from -4 to -2, ( f(x, 2) ) decreases from 0.5 to 0. Therefore, the maximum on this edge is 0.5 at ( x = -4 ).Edge 4: ( y = 4 ), ( x ) from -4 to -2.( f(x, 4) = frac{x + 4}{x} = 1 + frac{4}{x} )Again, ( x ) is negative, so ( frac{4}{x} ) is negative. Let's see the behavior as ( x ) increases from -4 to -2.At ( x = -4 ): ( 1 + frac{4}{-4} = 1 - 1 = 0 )At ( x = -2 ): ( 1 + frac{4}{-2} = 1 - 2 = -1 )So, as ( x ) increases, ( f(x, 4) ) decreases from 0 to -1. Therefore, the maximum on this edge is 0 at ( x = -4 ).So, summarizing the maximums on each edge:- Edge 1: 0.5- Edge 2: 0- Edge 3: 0.5- Edge 4: 0Therefore, the maximum value of ( f(x, y) ) on the entire domain is 0.5, achieved at the point ( (-4, 2) ).Just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider if there's any other point inside the domain where the function could be higher. But since we already checked the partial derivatives and found no critical points, and all the edge maxima are accounted for, I think 0.5 is indeed the maximum.Another way to think about this is to rewrite the expression:( frac{x + y}{x} = 1 + frac{y}{x} )Since ( x ) is negative, ( frac{y}{x} ) is negative. So, to maximize ( 1 + frac{y}{x} ), we need to make ( frac{y}{x} ) as least negative as possible, which happens when ( y ) is as small as possible and ( |x| ) is as large as possible. That is, ( y = 2 ) and ( x = -4 ). Plugging these in gives ( 1 + frac{2}{-4} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 ), which confirms our earlier result.So, after considering all possible approaches—evaluating corner points, checking edges, using partial derivatives, and analyzing the expression—it seems clear that the largest possible value of ( frac{x + y}{x} ) is ( 0.5 ).**Final Answer**The largest possible value is boxed{dfrac{1}{2}}."},{"question":"In a geometric sequence {a_{n}}, if a_{1}+a_{2}=2 and a_{5}+a_{6}=4, then a_{9}+a_{10}=______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to remember what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, if the first term is a₁, then the second term is a₁ * r, the third term is a₁ * r², and so on. So, in general, the nth term is a₁ * r^(n-1).Alright, the problem says that in this geometric sequence {aₙ}, a₁ + a₂ = 2 and a₅ + a₆ = 4. I need to find a₉ + a₁₀.Let me write down what I know:a₁ + a₂ = 2Since it's a geometric sequence, a₂ = a₁ * r. So, substituting that in:a₁ + a₁ * r = 2Which can be factored as:a₁ (1 + r) = 2  ...(1)Similarly, for a₅ + a₆ = 4.a₅ is the fifth term, which is a₁ * r⁴, and a₆ is a₁ * r⁵. So:a₁ * r⁴ + a₁ * r⁵ = 4Factor out a₁ * r⁴:a₁ * r⁴ (1 + r) = 4  ...(2)Now, I have two equations:From equation (1): a₁ (1 + r) = 2From equation (2): a₁ * r⁴ (1 + r) = 4Hmm, so if I divide equation (2) by equation (1), I can eliminate a₁ (1 + r):(a₁ * r⁴ (1 + r)) / (a₁ (1 + r)) ) = 4 / 2Simplify:r⁴ = 2So, r⁴ = 2. Therefore, r = 2^(1/4). But wait, 2^(1/4) is the fourth root of 2, which is approximately 1.1892, but I can just leave it as 2^(1/4) for exactness.But hold on, since r is a common ratio in a geometric sequence, it can be positive or negative, right? So, technically, r could be 2^(1/4) or -2^(1/4). Hmm, but let me think about whether both are possible.If r is negative, then the terms of the sequence would alternate in sign. Let me check if that's possible with the given information.From equation (1): a₁ (1 + r) = 2If r is negative, say r = -2^(1/4), then 1 + r would be 1 - 2^(1/4). Let me compute 2^(1/4). Since 2^(1/4) is about 1.1892, so 1 - 1.1892 is approximately -0.1892. So, 1 + r is negative in this case.Then, a₁ would be 2 divided by (1 + r), which would be 2 / (-0.1892) ≈ -10.576. So, a₁ is negative.But then, let's see if that affects the other terms. a₅ and a₆ would be a₁ * r⁴ and a₁ * r⁵. Since r⁴ is positive regardless of r being positive or negative, because any even power makes it positive. So, a₅ is a₁ * r⁴, which would be negative * positive = negative. Similarly, a₆ is a₁ * r⁵, which is negative * (negative or positive). Wait, r⁵ would be negative if r is negative, because 5 is odd. So, a₆ would be negative * negative = positive.So, a₅ is negative and a₆ is positive. So, a₅ + a₆ would be negative + positive. But the problem says a₅ + a₆ = 4, which is positive. So, is that possible?Let me compute a₅ + a₆ with r = -2^(1/4):a₅ = a₁ * r⁴ = a₁ * (2^(1/4))^4 = a₁ * 2Similarly, a₆ = a₁ * r⁵ = a₁ * r * r⁴ = a₁ * r * 2So, a₅ + a₆ = 2 a₁ + 2 a₁ rBut from equation (1): a₁ (1 + r) = 2, so 2 a₁ (1 + r) = 4. Therefore, a₅ + a₆ = 4, which matches the given condition. So, even if r is negative, it still works because the negative signs cancel out in the sum.So, both r = 2^(1/4) and r = -2^(1/4) are possible. Therefore, we have two possibilities for r.But let's see if the value of a₁ is consistent in both cases.Case 1: r = 2^(1/4)From equation (1): a₁ (1 + 2^(1/4)) = 2So, a₁ = 2 / (1 + 2^(1/4))Case 2: r = -2^(1/4)From equation (1): a₁ (1 - 2^(1/4)) = 2So, a₁ = 2 / (1 - 2^(1/4))Which is approximately 2 / (-0.1892) ≈ -10.576 as I calculated earlier.So, both cases are possible. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities when computing a₉ + a₁₀.But wait, let's see if a₉ + a₁₀ is the same in both cases.Compute a₉ + a₁₀:a₉ = a₁ * r⁸a₁₀ = a₁ * r⁹So, a₉ + a₁₀ = a₁ * r⁸ + a₁ * r⁹ = a₁ * r⁸ (1 + r)Similarly, let's express this in terms of known quantities.From equation (1): a₁ (1 + r) = 2From equation (2): a₁ * r⁴ (1 + r) = 4Notice that a₉ + a₁₀ = a₁ * r⁸ (1 + r) = (a₁ * r⁴ (1 + r)) * r⁴ = 4 * r⁴Because a₁ * r⁴ (1 + r) is 4, so multiplying by r⁴ gives 4 * r⁴.But we know that r⁴ = 2, so 4 * r⁴ = 4 * 2 = 8.Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of whether r is positive or negative, r⁴ is 2, so 4 * r⁴ is 8. Therefore, a₉ + a₁₀ = 8.So, even though r could be positive or negative, the result is the same because r⁴ is positive in both cases.Therefore, the answer is 8.But let me double-check that.Given that a₉ + a₁₀ = a₁ * r⁸ + a₁ * r⁹ = a₁ * r⁸ (1 + r)We know from equation (1) that a₁ (1 + r) = 2, so a₁ = 2 / (1 + r)So, substitute that into a₉ + a₁₀:a₉ + a₁₀ = (2 / (1 + r)) * r⁸ (1 + r) = 2 * r⁸But since r⁴ = 2, r⁸ = (r⁴)^2 = 2² = 4Therefore, a₉ + a₁₀ = 2 * 4 = 8Yes, that's another way to see it. So, regardless of the value of r, as long as r⁴ = 2, then a₉ + a₁₀ is 8.Therefore, the answer is 8.I think that makes sense. Let me recap:Given a geometric sequence with a₁ + a₂ = 2 and a₅ + a₆ = 4.Expressed in terms of a₁ and r:a₁(1 + r) = 2a₁ r⁴(1 + r) = 4Dividing the second equation by the first gives r⁴ = 2.Then, a₉ + a₁₀ = a₁ r⁸ (1 + r) = (a₁ r⁴ (1 + r)) * r⁴ = 4 * 2 = 8.So, yeah, 8 is the answer.**Final Answer**boxed{8}"},{"question":"If the arc length corresponding to a central angle of 2 radians is 4 cm, then the area of the sector enclosed by this central angle is      cm<sup>2</sup>.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: If the arc length corresponding to a central angle of 2 radians is 4 cm, then the area of the sector enclosed by this central angle is ____ cm². Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that the arc length (let's call it ( s )) of a circle is related to the radius (( r )) and the central angle (( theta )) in radians by the formula:[ s = r theta ]So, in this problem, they've given me that the arc length ( s ) is 4 cm, and the central angle ( theta ) is 2 radians. I need to find the area of the sector. But before I can find the area, I think I need to find the radius first because the area formula for a sector involves the radius as well.Let me write down the given values:- Arc length (( s )) = 4 cm- Central angle (( theta )) = 2 radiansUsing the arc length formula:[ s = r theta ]I can plug in the values I have:[ 4 = r times 2 ]Hmm, so to solve for ( r ), I can divide both sides by 2:[ r = frac{4}{2} = 2 text{ cm} ]Okay, so the radius of the circle is 2 cm. Now, moving on to finding the area of the sector. I recall that the area of a sector (( A )) is given by the formula:[ A = frac{1}{2} r^2 theta ]Where:- ( r ) is the radius- ( theta ) is the central angle in radiansI have both ( r ) and ( theta ) now. Let me plug those values into the formula:[ A = frac{1}{2} times (2)^2 times 2 ]Calculating step by step:First, square the radius:[ (2)^2 = 4 ]Then multiply by the central angle:[ 4 times 2 = 8 ]Now, multiply by ( frac{1}{2} ):[ frac{1}{2} times 8 = 4 ]So, the area of the sector is 4 cm². Wait, let me double-check that because sometimes I mix up the formulas.Arc length is ( s = r theta ), which I used correctly. Then area is ( frac{1}{2} r^2 theta ). Plugging in 2 for ( r ) and 2 for ( theta ):[ frac{1}{2} times 4 times 2 = frac{1}{2} times 8 = 4 ]Yeah, that seems right. So, the area is indeed 4 cm². I don't think I made any calculation errors here. Let me visualize it just to be sure.Imagine a circle with radius 2 cm. A central angle of 2 radians would correspond to an arc length of 4 cm, which we calculated. The sector formed by this angle would be like a slice of the circle. The area of this slice is 4 cm². That seems reasonable because the area of the entire circle would be ( pi r^2 = pi times 4 = 4pi ) cm², which is approximately 12.57 cm². Since 2 radians is a bit less than a third of the full circle (which is ( 2pi ) radians, approximately 6.28 radians), the sector area should be a bit less than a third of the total area. A third of 12.57 is about 4.19 cm², and our calculated area is 4 cm², which is a bit less, but that makes sense because 2 radians is a bit less than a third of the full circle. So, the numbers seem consistent.Alternatively, I can think about the proportion of the angle to the full circle. The full angle is ( 2pi ) radians, so the fraction of the circle that the sector represents is ( frac{2}{2pi} = frac{1}{pi} ). Therefore, the area of the sector should be ( frac{1}{pi} times pi r^2 = r^2 ). Wait, that would be ( (2)^2 = 4 ) cm². So, that also gives me 4 cm². Hmm, that's another way to look at it, and it confirms the same answer.So, both methods give me 4 cm².

Hmm, that seems like it involves expanding a binomial expression. I remember that when you raise a binomial to a power, you can use the binomial theorem. Let me recall what that is.The binomial theorem says that (a + b)^n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) * a^(n - k) * b^k. So, in this case, a is 1, b is sqrt(2), and n is 5. So, I can write out each term of the expansion.Let me write that out step by step. So, (1 + sqrt(2))^5 is equal to the sum from k=0 to 5 of (5 choose k) * 1^(5 - k) * (sqrt(2))^k. Since 1 raised to any power is just 1, that simplifies things a bit. So, each term becomes (5 choose k) * (sqrt(2))^k.Now, let me compute each term individually. Starting with k=0: (5 choose 0) is 1, and (sqrt(2))^0 is 1, so that term is 1*1 = 1.Next, k=1: (5 choose 1) is 5, and (sqrt(2))^1 is sqrt(2), so that term is 5*sqrt(2).k=2: (5 choose 2) is 10, and (sqrt(2))^2 is (sqrt(2))^2, which is 2. So, that term is 10*2 = 20.k=3: (5 choose 3) is 10, and (sqrt(2))^3 is (sqrt(2))^2 * sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(2). So, that term is 10*2*sqrt(2) = 20*sqrt(2).k=4: (5 choose 4) is 5, and (sqrt(2))^4 is (sqrt(2))^2 squared, which is 2^2 = 4. So, that term is 5*4 = 20.k=5: (5 choose 5) is 1, and (sqrt(2))^5 is (sqrt(2))^4 * sqrt(2) = 4*sqrt(2). So, that term is 1*4*sqrt(2) = 4*sqrt(2).Now, let me write down all these terms:1 + 5*sqrt(2) + 20 + 20*sqrt(2) + 20 + 4*sqrt(2).Now, I need to combine like terms. The constant terms are 1, 20, and 20. Adding those together: 1 + 20 + 20 = 41.The terms with sqrt(2) are 5*sqrt(2), 20*sqrt(2), and 4*sqrt(2). Adding those together: 5 + 20 + 4 = 29, so that's 29*sqrt(2).So, putting it all together, (1 + sqrt(2))^5 = 41 + 29*sqrt(2). Therefore, a is 41 and b is 29. So, a + b is 41 + 29 = 70.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through each term again.For k=0: 1, correct.k=1: 5*sqrt(2), correct.k=2: 10*(sqrt(2))^2 = 10*2 = 20, correct.k=3: 10*(sqrt(2))^3 = 10*(2*sqrt(2)) = 20*sqrt(2), correct.k=4: 5*(sqrt(2))^4 = 5*(4) = 20, correct.k=5: 1*(sqrt(2))^5 = 1*(4*sqrt(2)) = 4*sqrt(2), correct.Adding constants: 1 + 20 + 20 = 41, correct.Adding sqrt(2) terms: 5 + 20 + 4 = 29, so 29*sqrt(2), correct.So, a = 41, b = 29, so a + b = 70. That seems right.Alternatively, I remember that (1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n is an integer because the irrational parts cancel out. Maybe I can use that to check my answer.Let me compute (1 + sqrt(2))^5 + (1 - sqrt(2))^5. If that equals 2a, then a should be half of that sum. Similarly, (1 + sqrt(2))^5 - (1 - sqrt(2))^5 would be 2b*sqrt(2), so b would be half of that difference divided by sqrt(2).But maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let me try computing (1 + sqrt(2))^5 numerically and see if it matches 41 + 29*sqrt(2).First, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142.So, 1 + sqrt(2) is approximately 2.4142.Raising that to the 5th power: 2.4142^5.Let me compute that step by step.2.4142^2 is approximately (2.4142)*(2.4142). Let's compute that:2 * 2 = 42 * 0.4142 = 0.82840.4142 * 2 = 0.82840.4142 * 0.4142 ≈ 0.1716Adding them up: 4 + 0.8284 + 0.8284 + 0.1716 ≈ 4 + 1.6568 + 0.1716 ≈ 5.8284.Wait, that can't be right because 2.4142^2 is actually (1 + sqrt(2))^2 = 1 + 2*sqrt(2) + 2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(2) ≈ 3 + 2.8284 ≈ 5.8284, which matches.So, 2.4142^2 ≈ 5.8284.Then, 2.4142^3 = 2.4142^2 * 2.4142 ≈ 5.8284 * 2.4142.Compute 5 * 2.4142 = 12.0710.8284 * 2.4142 ≈ 2.000 (approximate, since 0.8284 is roughly 2/sqrt(2), and 2/sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, but let me compute it more accurately).0.8284 * 2 = 1.65680.8284 * 0.4142 ≈ 0.342So, total is approximately 1.6568 + 0.342 ≈ 1.9988, which is roughly 2.So, 5.8284 * 2.4142 ≈ 12.071 + 2 ≈ 14.071.But let's compute it more accurately:5.8284 * 2.4142:Multiply 5.8284 by 2: 11.6568Multiply 5.8284 by 0.4142:Compute 5 * 0.4142 = 2.0710.8284 * 0.4142 ≈ 0.342So, 2.071 + 0.342 ≈ 2.413So, total is 11.6568 + 2.413 ≈ 14.0698.So, 2.4142^3 ≈ 14.0698.Then, 2.4142^4 = 2.4142^3 * 2.4142 ≈ 14.0698 * 2.4142.Compute 14 * 2.4142 = 33.8 (since 10*2.4142=24.142, 4*2.4142≈9.6568, so total ≈24.142 + 9.6568≈33.7988)0.0698 * 2.4142 ≈ 0.1685So, total ≈33.7988 + 0.1685 ≈33.9673.So, 2.4142^4 ≈33.9673.Then, 2.4142^5 = 2.4142^4 * 2.4142 ≈33.9673 * 2.4142.Compute 33 * 2.4142 = 79.66860.9673 * 2.4142 ≈ 2.337So, total ≈79.6686 + 2.337 ≈82.0056.So, (1 + sqrt(2))^5 ≈82.0056.Now, let's compute 41 + 29*sqrt(2):41 + 29*1.4142 ≈41 + 41.0118 ≈82.0118.Hmm, that's very close to the numerical approximation of (1 + sqrt(2))^5, which was approximately 82.0056. The slight difference is likely due to rounding errors in the decimal approximations.So, that gives me more confidence that my expansion was correct, and that a = 41 and b = 29, so a + b = 70.Alternatively, another way to approach this is using recurrence relations or recognizing patterns in powers of (1 + sqrt(2)). I remember that powers of (1 + sqrt(2)) relate to solutions of Pell's equation, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.But since I've already expanded it using the binomial theorem and checked it numerically, I think my answer is solid.Just to recap:(1 + sqrt(2))^5 = 1 + 5*sqrt(2) + 10*(sqrt(2))^2 + 10*(sqrt(2))^3 + 5*(sqrt(2))^4 + (sqrt(2))^5Simplify each term:1 + 5*sqrt(2) + 10*2 + 10*(2*sqrt(2)) + 5*4 + 4*sqrt(2)Which becomes:1 + 5*sqrt(2) + 20 + 20*sqrt(2) + 20 + 4*sqrt(2)Combine constants: 1 + 20 + 20 = 41Combine sqrt(2) terms: 5 + 20 + 4 = 29, so 29*sqrt(2)Thus, (1 + sqrt(2))^5 = 41 + 29*sqrt(2), so a = 41, b = 29, and a + b = 70.Yep, that all adds up. I think I'm confident with that answer.**Final Answer**The value of (a + b) is boxed{70}."},{"question":"A line passing through the intersection point of the medians of triangle (ABC) intersects the sides (BA) and (BC) at points (A^{prime}) and (C_1) respectively. Given that:(BA^{prime} < BA = 3), (BC = 2), and (BA^{prime} cdot BC_1 = 3). Find (BA^{prime}).","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.We have triangle (ABC). A line passes through the intersection point of the medians of this triangle. That intersection point is called the centroid, right? So, the centroid is where all three medians meet, and it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex.This line intersects sides (BA) and (BC) at points (A') and (C_1) respectively. So, the line is cutting through two sides of the triangle, BA and BC, creating two new points, (A') on BA and (C_1) on BC.Given information:- (BA' < BA = 3). So, the length of BA is 3 units, and BA' is less than that.- (BC = 2). So, the length of BC is 2 units.- (BA' cdot BC_1 = 3). The product of BA' and BC_1 is 3.We need to find (BA').Hmm. Let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with BA = 3, BC = 2. The centroid is inside the triangle, and a line passes through it, cutting BA at A' and BC at C1. So, the line A'C1 passes through the centroid.I remember that in such cases, there's a theorem related to centroids and lines passing through them. Maybe it's the centroid theorem or something related to mass point geometry?Wait, mass point geometry might be useful here. Let me recall. Mass point assigns weights to the vertices such that the centroid balances the triangle. Since centroid divides each median in 2:1, the masses at the vertices would be proportional to the lengths.Alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry would work here. Let me try setting up coordinates for triangle ABC.Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Let me assume that BA is along the x-axis, so point A is at (3,0). Point C is somewhere else; since BC = 2, but I don't know the coordinates yet. Wait, maybe I need more information. Alternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates such that calculations are easier.Wait, let me think. If I place B at (0,0), A at (3,0), and C somewhere in the plane, say (0,c) so that BC = 2. Then, the distance from B to C is 2, so the coordinates of C would be (0,2). Wait, but then BA is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (3,0), and BC is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,2). So, triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.Is that a valid assumption? The problem doesn't specify the type of triangle, but if I can choose coordinates to simplify the problem, that might help. So, let's proceed with that.So, coordinates:- B: (0,0)- A: (3,0)- C: (0,2)Now, the centroid G of triangle ABC is the average of the coordinates of the vertices. So, centroid G is at ((3+0+0)/3, (0+0+2)/3) = (1, 2/3).So, centroid G is at (1, 2/3).Now, the line passing through G intersects BA at A' and BC at C1. Let me denote A' as a point on BA. Since BA is from (0,0) to (3,0), any point on BA can be represented as (x, 0) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 3. Similarly, BC is from (0,0) to (0,2), so any point on BC can be represented as (0, y) where 0 ≤ y ≤ 2.So, points A' is (x, 0) and C1 is (0, y). The line passing through A' and C1 also passes through G (1, 2/3).So, the line passes through three points: A'(x,0), G(1, 2/3), and C1(0,y). So, these three points are colinear.Therefore, the slope between A' and G should be equal to the slope between G and C1.Let me compute the slope between A'(x,0) and G(1, 2/3):Slope = (2/3 - 0)/(1 - x) = (2/3)/(1 - x)Similarly, the slope between G(1, 2/3) and C1(0,y):Slope = (y - 2/3)/(0 - 1) = (y - 2/3)/(-1) = (2/3 - y)/1Since the slopes are equal:(2/3)/(1 - x) = (2/3 - y)/1So,(2/3) = (2/3 - y)(1 - x)Let me write that as:(2/3) = (2/3 - y)(1 - x)Also, we know that BA' = x, since BA is from (0,0) to (3,0), so BA' is the distance from B(0,0) to A'(x,0), which is x. Similarly, BC1 is the distance from B(0,0) to C1(0,y), which is y.Given that BA' = x, BC1 = y, and BA' * BC1 = 3, so x * y = 3.So, we have two equations:1) (2/3) = (2/3 - y)(1 - x)2) x * y = 3We need to solve for x and y.Let me denote equation 1:(2/3) = (2/3 - y)(1 - x)Let me expand the right-hand side:(2/3 - y)(1 - x) = (2/3)(1 - x) - y(1 - x) = 2/3 - (2/3)x - y + x ySo, equation 1 becomes:2/3 = 2/3 - (2/3)x - y + x ySubtract 2/3 from both sides:0 = - (2/3)x - y + x ySo,- (2/3)x - y + x y = 0Let me rearrange:x y - (2/3)x - y = 0Factor terms:x(y - 2/3) - y = 0Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's factor y:y(x - 1) - (2/3)x = 0So,y(x - 1) = (2/3)xThus,y = ( (2/3)x ) / (x - 1 )So, y = (2x/3)/(x - 1)From equation 2, we have x y = 3, so y = 3/x.Therefore, set the two expressions for y equal:(2x/3)/(x - 1) = 3/xCross-multiplying:(2x/3) * x = 3 * (x - 1)Simplify:(2x²)/3 = 3x - 3Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominator:2x² = 9x - 9Bring all terms to left-hand side:2x² - 9x + 9 = 0So, quadratic equation: 2x² - 9x + 9 = 0Let me solve for x using quadratic formula.Discriminant D = 81 - 4*2*9 = 81 - 72 = 9So,x = [9 ± sqrt(9)] / (2*2) = [9 ± 3]/4Thus,x = (9 + 3)/4 = 12/4 = 3x = (9 - 3)/4 = 6/4 = 3/2But, given that BA' < BA = 3, so x < 3. Therefore, x = 3 is rejected.Thus, x = 3/2.Therefore, BA' = x = 3/2.Let me check if that makes sense.So, x = 3/2, then y = 3/x = 3/(3/2) = 2.So, y = 2.Wait, but BC1 is y, and BC = 2, so BC1 = 2, which would mean that C1 is at point C, which is (0,2). But the line passes through C1, which is point C, and A', which is (3/2, 0). So, the line passes through (3/2, 0) and (0,2). Let me check if this line passes through centroid G(1, 2/3).Equation of the line through (3/2, 0) and (0,2):Slope = (2 - 0)/(0 - 3/2) = 2 / (-3/2) = -4/3Equation: y - 0 = (-4/3)(x - 3/2)So, y = (-4/3)x + (-4/3)*(-3/2) = (-4/3)x + 2Now, plug in x = 1:y = (-4/3)(1) + 2 = -4/3 + 6/3 = 2/3Which is exactly the y-coordinate of G. So, yes, the line passes through G(1, 2/3). So, that checks out.Therefore, BA' = 3/2.Wait, but let me think again. If C1 is at (0,2), which is point C, then the line is passing through A'(3/2, 0) and C(0,2). So, in this case, the line is AC, but wait, AC is from A(3,0) to C(0,2). So, is A'(3/2, 0) lying on AC?Wait, let me check. The line AC has slope (2 - 0)/(0 - 3) = -2/3. Equation: y = (-2/3)x + 2.At x = 3/2, y = (-2/3)(3/2) + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1.But A' is at (3/2, 0), which is not on AC. So, the line A'C1 is different from AC.Wait, but in our setup, C1 is at (0,2), which is point C. So, the line is from A'(3/2,0) to C(0,2). So, that's a different line from AC.But in our coordinate system, AC is from (3,0) to (0,2), which is a different line. So, that's fine.So, the line A'C1 passes through centroid G(1, 2/3). So, that seems correct.Therefore, the solution is BA' = 3/2.But wait, let me check if there's another possible solution.Earlier, when solving the quadratic, we got x = 3 and x = 3/2. We rejected x = 3 because BA' < BA = 3. So, x = 3 is equal to BA, but BA' is strictly less than BA, so x must be 3/2.Therefore, the answer is 3/2.Wait, just to make sure, let me plug x = 3/2 into equation 1.Equation 1: (2/3) = (2/3 - y)(1 - x)We have x = 3/2, so 1 - x = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2We have y = 3/x = 3/(3/2) = 2So, 2/3 - y = 2/3 - 2 = -4/3Thus, (2/3 - y)(1 - x) = (-4/3)(-1/2) = (4/3)(1/2) = 2/3Which equals the left-hand side, so it's correct.Therefore, everything checks out.**Final Answer**The length of (BA') is boxed{dfrac{3}{2}}."},{"question":"On an auto trip, the distance read from the instrument panel was 450 miles.

Let me try to understand what's going on. First, the car went on a trip, and the instrument panel showed 450 miles. Then, on the return trip, they used snow tires, and the instrument panel showed 440 miles. The question is asking for the increase in the radius of the wheels due to the snow tires, given that the original radius was 15 inches. They want the answer to the nearest hundredth of an inch, and the options are given from A to E.Hmm, okay. So, I think this has to do with the circumference of the wheels. Because if the radius changes, the circumference changes, which would affect how the car measures distance. The car's instrument panel measures distance based on the number of wheel rotations, right? So, if the wheels have a different circumference, the same number of rotations would correspond to a different actual distance.Let me write down what I know:- Original distance: 450 miles- Return distance with snow tires: 440 miles- Original radius: 15 inches- Need to find: increase in radius (Δr) to the nearest hundredth of an inchSo, the key here is that the actual distance for both trips is the same, right? Because it's a round trip. So, the first trip was 450 miles according to the instrument panel, but the return trip, which was actually the same distance, was measured as 440 miles. That means that with the snow tires, the car's wheels must have a larger circumference, so each rotation covers more distance, hence fewer rotations are needed to cover the same actual distance.Wait, hold on. If the return trip was measured as 440 miles, which is less than 450, does that mean the car thought it went a shorter distance? But the actual distance is the same. So, that would mean that each wheel rotation was actually covering more distance, so the car's computer, which measures distance based on wheel rotations, thought it went less.So, the actual distance is the same for both trips. Let me denote the actual distance as D. So, D = 450 miles (original trip) and D = 440 miles (return trip). But wait, that can't be, because D must be the same. So, actually, the 450 and 440 are the readings, but the actual distance is the same.Therefore, the 450 miles is what the car's instrument panel read on the way there, and 440 miles on the way back. But the actual distance for both trips is the same. So, the first trip, with the original tires, the car's computer measured 450 miles, but the actual distance was more because the tires had a smaller circumference? Wait, no, wait.Wait, no, actually, if the car's computer measures distance based on wheel rotations, then if the wheel circumference is smaller, each rotation would correspond to less actual distance. So, if the car's computer measures 450 miles, but the actual distance is more because the wheel was slipping or something? Hmm, no, maybe I need to think differently.Wait, maybe it's about the odometer. The odometer measures distance based on wheel rotations. So, if the wheel circumference is smaller, each rotation would correspond to less distance, so the odometer would overestimate the distance. Conversely, if the circumference is larger, each rotation corresponds to more distance, so the odometer would underestimate the distance.Wait, so in this case, on the return trip, the odometer reading was 440 miles, which is less than 450. So, the odometer thought the car went a shorter distance. That would mean that each wheel rotation was actually covering more distance, so the circumference must have increased. Therefore, the radius increased.So, the actual distance D is the same for both trips. So, D = 450 miles (original trip) and D = 440 miles (return trip). But wait, that can't be, because D is the same. So, actually, D is equal to both 450 and 440, but that's not possible. So, maybe I need to think in terms of the actual distance.Wait, let me clarify. The instrument panel measures distance based on wheel rotations. So, if the wheel circumference is C, then the distance D is equal to the number of rotations N multiplied by C. So, D = N * C.On the first trip, the car's instrument panel showed 450 miles, which is the number of rotations N1 multiplied by the original circumference C1. On the return trip, the instrument panel showed 440 miles, which is the number of rotations N2 multiplied by the new circumference C2. But the actual distance D is the same for both trips, so:N1 * C1 = DN2 * C2 = DTherefore, N1 * C1 = N2 * C2But the instrument panel readings are N1 * C1 = 450 and N2 * C2 = 440. Wait, that can't be, because D is the same. So, actually, the actual distance D is equal to both 450 and 440, but that's not possible. So, I must have misunderstood.Wait, no, hold on. The instrument panel measures distance based on wheel rotations. So, if the wheel circumference is C, then the distance D is N * C, where N is the number of rotations. So, on the first trip, the odometer reading is 450 miles, which is N1 * C1 = 450. On the return trip, the odometer reading is 440 miles, which is N2 * C2 = 440. But the actual distance D is the same for both trips, so:N1 * C1 = DN2 * C2 = DTherefore, N1 * C1 = N2 * C2But N1 * C1 = 450 and N2 * C2 = 440, so 450 = 440? That can't be. So, I must have messed up.Wait, no, the actual distance is the same, so D = N1 * C1 = N2 * C2. But the odometer readings are N1 * C1 = 450 and N2 * C2 = 440. So, that would mean that D = 450 and D = 440, which is impossible. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.Wait, maybe the odometer is not measuring the actual distance, but the car's computer is using the wheel rotations to calculate the distance. So, if the wheel circumference is different, the same number of rotations would correspond to a different actual distance.Wait, so on the first trip, the car's odometer was set up for the original tire circumference, so it correctly measured 450 miles. On the return trip, they changed the tires, which had a different circumference, so the odometer, which is still set up for the original circumference, now incorrectly measures the distance as 440 miles. So, the actual distance is 450 miles, but with the new tires, the odometer reads 440 miles.Wait, that makes more sense. So, the actual distance is 450 miles both ways. On the first trip, the odometer correctly reads 450 because the tires are the same. On the return trip, with snow tires, the odometer, which is still set for the original circumference, reads 440 miles, but the actual distance is still 450 miles.Therefore, the number of rotations N2 for the return trip is such that N2 * C1 = 440, but the actual distance is N2 * C2 = 450. So, N2 * C2 = 450, and N2 * C1 = 440.Therefore, we can write:N2 = 440 / C1But also, N2 = 450 / C2So, 440 / C1 = 450 / C2Therefore, C2 = (450 / 440) * C1So, C2 = (45/44) * C1Therefore, the new circumference is (45/44) times the original circumference.Since circumference is 2πr, so C2 = 2π(r + Δr), where Δr is the increase in radius.Similarly, C1 = 2πr, where r = 15 inches.So, plugging in:2π(r + Δr) = (45/44) * 2πrWe can cancel out 2π from both sides:r + Δr = (45/44) * rTherefore, Δr = (45/44) * r - r = r * (45/44 - 1) = r * (1/44)So, Δr = 15 * (1/44) inchesCalculating that:15 divided by 44 is approximately 0.3409 inches.So, to the nearest hundredth, that's 0.34 inches.Looking at the options, B is 0.34, so that should be the answer.Wait, let me double-check my reasoning.So, the actual distance is 450 miles both ways. On the return trip, with snow tires, the odometer reads 440 miles because the circumference is larger, so each rotation covers more distance, hence fewer rotations are needed to cover the same actual distance. Therefore, the odometer, which is set for the original circumference, thinks the distance is less.So, the relationship is that the number of rotations N2 = 440 / C1, but the actual distance is N2 * C2 = 450. So, 440 / C1 * C2 = 450, which gives C2 = (450 / 440) * C1, as I had before.Therefore, C2 = (45/44) * C1, so the new circumference is 45/44 times the original.Since circumference is 2πr, the new radius is (45/44) * original radius.Wait, hold on, no. Wait, C2 = 2π(r + Δr) = (45/44) * 2πr, so we can divide both sides by 2π:r + Δr = (45/44) * rTherefore, Δr = (45/44 - 1) * r = (1/44) * r = 15 / 44 ≈ 0.3409 inches.So, yes, 0.34 inches when rounded to the nearest hundredth.Therefore, the answer is B) 0.34.I think that makes sense. Let me just recap:- The actual distance for both trips is 450 miles.- On the return trip, the odometer reads 440 miles because the tires have a larger circumference.- The ratio of the circumferences is 450/440 = 45/44.- Therefore, the new radius is (45/44) times the original radius.- The increase in radius is (45/44 - 1) times the original radius, which is 15*(1/44) ≈ 0.34 inches.Yep, that seems solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 0.34 inches, which is option B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Find the two-digit number that is equal to the sum of the cube of its tens digit and the square of its units digit.","answer":"First, I need to identify all two-digit numbers.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that a power function is generally of the form f(x) = x^n, where n is some exponent. The problem tells me that this function passes through the point (2, sqrt(2)). That means when x is 2, f(x) is sqrt(2). So, I can plug these values into the function to find n.Let me write that out: f(2) = 2^n = sqrt(2). Hmm, okay, so 2 raised to some power n equals the square root of 2. I need to figure out what n is.I know that sqrt(2) can be written as 2^(1/2). So, 2^n = 2^(1/2). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, n must be 1/2. So, n = 1/2.Wait, let me double-check that. If n is 1/2, then f(x) = x^(1/2), which is the square root of x. So, f(2) would be sqrt(2), which matches the point given. That seems right.So, now that I know n is 1/2, the function is f(x) = x^(1/2). Now, I need to find f(9). That should be straightforward.Calculating f(9) would be 9^(1/2), which is the square root of 9. The square root of 9 is 3, since 3 times 3 is 9. So, f(9) should be 3.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, starting from the beginning: the function is f(x) = x^n, passes through (2, sqrt(2)). So, 2^n = sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), n is 1/2. Then, f(x) = x^(1/2). So, f(9) is sqrt(9) which is 3. Yeah, that seems correct.I don't think I made any errors in my reasoning. It all follows logically. So, I think the answer is 3.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(9) ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"There are five unmarked envelopes on a table, each with a letter for a different person.  If the mail is randomly distributed to these five people, with each person getting one letter, what is the probability that exactly four people get the right letter?","answer":"To determine the probability that exactly four people receive the correct letter, I start by analyzing the total number of possible distributions. Since there are five letters and five people, each person can receive any of the five letters. This results in 5! = 120 possible ways to distribute the letters.Next, I consider the number of favorable outcomes where exactly four people get the correct letter. If four people have the correct letter, the fifth person must also receive the correct letter because there's only one letter left. This means that it's impossible to have exactly four people with the correct letter without the fifth person also being correct.Therefore, there are no scenarios where exactly four people receive the correct letter. The number of favorable outcomes is zero.Finally, the probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible distributions. This results in a probability of 0/120, which simplifies to 0."},{"question":"In an isosceles triangle, the lengths of two sides are 3 and 6 respectively. The perimeter of this triangle is ____.","answer":"To determine the perimeter of the isosceles triangle, I first identify the two given side lengths: 3 and 6.Since it's an isosceles triangle, two sides must be equal. I consider two possibilities:1. The two equal sides are both 3 units long. In this case, the third side would be 6 units. However, this violates the triangle inequality theorem because 3 + 3 is not greater than 6.2. The two equal sides are both 6 units long. Here, the third side is 3 units. This satisfies the triangle inequality theorem because 6 + 6 is greater than 3, 6 + 3 is greater than 6, and 6 + 3 is greater than 6.Therefore, the valid side lengths are 6, 6, and 3. Adding these together gives a perimeter of 15 units."},{"question":"A rectangular garden 50 feet long and 10 feet wide is enclosed by a fence. To make the garden larger, while using the same fence, its shape is changed to a square. By how many square feet does this enlarge the garden?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total length of the fence. The garden is currently a rectangle with a length of 50 feet and a width of 10 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula 2 times the sum of its length and width. So, the perimeter is 2 times (50 feet plus 10 feet), which equals 120 feet.Next, since the fence length remains the same when changing the shape to a square, each side of the square will be one-fourth of the total perimeter. Therefore, each side of the square is 120 feet divided by 4, resulting in 30 feet.Now, I'll calculate the area of the original rectangular garden. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width, so 50 feet multiplied by 10 feet equals 500 square feet.Then, I'll find the area of the new square garden. The area of a square is the side length squared, which is 30 feet multiplied by 30 feet, giving 900 square feet.Finally, to determine how much larger the garden has become, I'll subtract the original area from the new area. That is, 900 square feet minus 500 square feet, resulting in an increase of 400 square feet."},{"question":"The students of a school went on a trip, for which two buses were hired.

Hmm, interesting. I remember that sometimes expressions involving cube roots can be simplified if they are conjugate pairs. Maybe I can let this expression equal to some integer and then cube both sides to solve for it.Let me denote:x = sqrt[3]{2+frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}} + sqrt[3]{2-frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}}Since it's given that x is an integer, I can try cubing both sides to see if I can find x.So, cubing both sides:x^3 = left( sqrt[3]{2+frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}} + sqrt[3]{2-frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}} right)^3I recall the formula for (a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b). Let me apply that here.Let me denote:a = sqrt[3]{2+frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}}, quad b = sqrt[3]{2-frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}}Then,x^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b)We know that a^3 = 2 + frac{10}{9}sqrt{3} and b^3 = 2 - frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}. So, adding them together:a^3 + b^3 = left(2 + frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}right) + left(2 - frac{10}{9}sqrt{3}right) = 4So, x^3 = 4 + 3ab(a + b).

The point Q is at (0, b), and the side PR is parallel to the x-axis. Additionally, the foci F₁ and F₂ lie on sides QR and PQ, respectively. I need to find the ratio PQ / F₁F₂.First, let me recall some properties of ellipses. The standard equation is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis. The distance from the center to each focus is c, where c² = a² - b². So, the foci are located at (±c, 0).Given that the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal in length, so PQ = QR = PR. Also, since PR is parallel to the x-axis, points P and R must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. That is, if P is at (h, k), then R is at (-h, k). Given that Q is at (0, b), which is the topmost point of the ellipse, that makes sense because the ellipse is symmetric about both axes. So, points P and R are on the ellipse, and their y-coordinates are the same, which is k.Since PR is parallel to the x-axis, the length of PR is 2h, because the distance between (h, k) and (-h, k) is 2h. Since the triangle is equilateral, the length PQ should be equal to PR. So, PQ = 2h.Now, let me find the coordinates of points P and R. Let me denote P as (h, k) and R as (-h, k). Since both P and R lie on the ellipse, they satisfy the ellipse equation:h²/a² + k²/b² = 1.Also, since triangle PQR is equilateral, the distance from Q to P should be equal to the distance from P to R. Let's compute these distances.First, the distance PQ is the distance between (0, b) and (h, k). Using the distance formula:PQ = sqrt[(h - 0)² + (k - b)²] = sqrt(h² + (k - b)²].Similarly, the distance PR is the distance between (h, k) and (-h, k), which is sqrt[( -h - h)² + (k - k)²] = sqrt[(-2h)² + 0] = sqrt[4h²] = 2h.Since PQ = PR, we have:sqrt(h² + (k - b)²) = 2h.Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:h² + (k - b)² = 4h².Simplify:(k - b)² = 3h².Take square roots:k - b = ±sqrt(3) h.But since the triangle is inscribed in the ellipse, and Q is at (0, b), which is the top of the ellipse, points P and R must be below Q. So, k must be less than b. Therefore, k - b is negative, so:k - b = -sqrt(3) h.Thus,k = b - sqrt(3) h.So, we have an expression for k in terms of h.Now, since point P is on the ellipse, plugging (h, k) into the ellipse equation:h²/a² + k²/b² = 1.But we know that k = b - sqrt(3) h, so let's substitute that:h²/a² + (b - sqrt(3) h)² / b² = 1.Let me expand (b - sqrt(3) h)²:= b² - 2b sqrt(3) h + 3 h².So, substituting back:h²/a² + [b² - 2b sqrt(3) h + 3 h²] / b² = 1.Let me split the fraction:h²/a² + (b² / b²) - (2b sqrt(3) h)/b² + (3 h²)/b² = 1.Simplify each term:h²/a² + 1 - (2 sqrt(3) h)/b + (3 h²)/b² = 1.Subtract 1 from both sides:h²/a² - (2 sqrt(3) h)/b + (3 h²)/b² = 0.Let me combine the h² terms:h² (1/a² + 3 / b²) - (2 sqrt(3) h)/b = 0.Factor out h:h [ h (1/a² + 3 / b²) - (2 sqrt(3))/b ] = 0.So, either h = 0, which would mean points P and R coincide at (0, k), but that can't form a triangle, so we discard h = 0.Thus, the other factor must be zero:h (1/a² + 3 / b²) - (2 sqrt(3))/b = 0.Solve for h:h (1/a² + 3 / b²) = (2 sqrt(3))/b.Therefore,h = [ (2 sqrt(3))/b ] / (1/a² + 3 / b² ).Let me write this as:h = (2 sqrt(3)/b) / ( (b² + 3 a²) / (a² b²) )Because 1/a² + 3 / b² = (b² + 3 a²)/(a² b²).So, h = (2 sqrt(3)/b) * (a² b²)/(b² + 3 a²) = (2 sqrt(3) a² b) / (b² + 3 a²).So, h = (2 sqrt(3) a² b) / (b² + 3 a²).Okay, so now we have h in terms of a and b.Earlier, we had k = b - sqrt(3) h.So, let's compute k:k = b - sqrt(3) * [ (2 sqrt(3) a² b) / (b² + 3 a²) ]Simplify sqrt(3) * 2 sqrt(3) = 2 * 3 = 6.So,k = b - [6 a² b / (b² + 3 a²) ].Factor out b:k = b [ 1 - 6 a² / (b² + 3 a²) ].Simplify the expression inside the brackets:1 - 6 a² / (b² + 3 a²) = (b² + 3 a² - 6 a²) / (b² + 3 a²) = (b² - 3 a²) / (b² + 3 a²).Therefore,k = b (b² - 3 a²) / (b² + 3 a²).So, now we have coordinates for P and R:P = (h, k) = ( (2 sqrt(3) a² b)/(b² + 3 a²), b (b² - 3 a²)/(b² + 3 a²) )Similarly, R is (-h, k).Now, let's recall that the foci F₁ and F₂ lie on sides QR and PQ, respectively.First, let's find the coordinates of F₁ and F₂.Foci of the ellipse are at (c, 0) and (-c, 0), where c = sqrt(a² - b²).So, F₁ is (c, 0) and F₂ is (-c, 0).Given that F₁ lies on QR and F₂ lies on PQ.So, let's find the equations of sides QR and PQ, and then verify that F₁ is on QR and F₂ is on PQ.First, let's find the equation of QR.Points Q and R are Q(0, b) and R(-h, k).So, the slope of QR is (k - b)/(-h - 0) = (k - b)/(-h).But earlier, we found that k - b = -sqrt(3) h.So, slope = (-sqrt(3) h)/(-h) = sqrt(3).Therefore, the equation of QR is:y - b = sqrt(3)(x - 0), so y = sqrt(3) x + b.Similarly, let's find the equation of PQ.Points P(h, k) and Q(0, b).Slope of PQ is (k - b)/(h - 0) = (k - b)/h.Again, k - b = -sqrt(3) h, so slope = (-sqrt(3) h)/h = -sqrt(3).Thus, the equation of PQ is:y - b = -sqrt(3)(x - 0), so y = -sqrt(3) x + b.Now, we know that F₁ is on QR, so plugging F₁(c, 0) into QR's equation:0 = sqrt(3) * c + b.Similarly, F₂ is on PQ, so plugging F₂(-c, 0) into PQ's equation:0 = -sqrt(3)*(-c) + b => 0 = sqrt(3) c + b.Wait, that's the same equation as for F₁. So, both foci lie on lines QR and PQ, which gives the same condition:sqrt(3) c + b = 0.But sqrt(3) c + b = 0 implies that b = -sqrt(3) c.But b is the semi-minor axis, which is positive, and c is positive as well, so this can't be. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let's check the equations again.Equation of QR: y = sqrt(3) x + b.F₁ is at (c, 0). So, plugging into QR's equation:0 = sqrt(3) * c + b.Similarly, equation of PQ: y = -sqrt(3) x + b.F₂ is at (-c, 0). Plugging into PQ's equation:0 = -sqrt(3)*(-c) + b => 0 = sqrt(3) c + b.So, both give 0 = sqrt(3) c + b.But since b and c are positive, this would imply that sqrt(3) c + b = 0, which is impossible because both terms are positive. So, that suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the slope of QR or PQ.Wait, let's recalculate the slope of QR.Points Q(0, b) and R(-h, k).So, slope m = (k - b)/(-h - 0) = (k - b)/(-h).But k - b = -sqrt(3) h, so m = (-sqrt(3) h)/(-h) = sqrt(3). That seems correct.Similarly, slope of PQ: (k - b)/(h - 0) = (k - b)/h = (-sqrt(3) h)/h = -sqrt(3). That also seems correct.So, equations are correct.But then, plugging F₁(c, 0) into QR's equation gives 0 = sqrt(3) c + b, which is impossible because b and c are positive.Similarly, plugging F₂(-c, 0) into PQ's equation gives 0 = sqrt(3) c + b, same problem.Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the foci are not at (c, 0) and (-c, 0), but wait, that's standard for an ellipse.Wait, unless the major axis is along the y-axis. But in the given ellipse equation, x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, so if a > b, major axis is along x-axis, foci at (±c, 0). If b > a, major axis is along y-axis, foci at (0, ±c). But in the Asymptote code, the ellipse is drawn as yscale(b)*xscale(a)*Circle((0,0),1), which suggests that a and b are the semi-axes, with a along x and b along y.But in the Asymptote code, a is set to 5, and b is set to sqrt(3)/2 *5, which is approximately 4.33, so a = 5, b ≈4.33, so a > b, so major axis is along x-axis, foci at (±c, 0), where c = sqrt(a² - b²).So, that part is correct.But then, in the problem statement, it says foci F₁ and F₂ lie on sides QR and PQ, respectively.But according to the equations, plugging F₁(c, 0) into QR's equation gives 0 = sqrt(3) c + b, which is impossible. So, perhaps my mistake is in the coordinates of P and R.Wait, let me double-check the coordinates of P and R.Given that PR is parallel to the x-axis, so P and R have the same y-coordinate, say k.Then, since triangle PQR is equilateral, the distance PQ equals PR.We found that PQ = sqrt(h² + (k - b)^2) and PR = 2h, so sqrt(h² + (k - b)^2) = 2h, leading to (k - b)^2 = 3 h².Since P is below Q, k < b, so k = b - sqrt(3) h.Then, plugging into the ellipse equation:h²/a² + (b - sqrt(3) h)^2 / b² = 1.Which leads to h²/a² + (b² - 2 sqrt(3) b h + 3 h²)/b² = 1.Which simplifies to h²/a² + 1 - (2 sqrt(3) h)/b + 3 h² / b² = 1.Subtracting 1: h²/a² - (2 sqrt(3) h)/b + 3 h² / b² = 0.Factor h: h [ h (1/a² + 3 / b² ) - (2 sqrt(3))/b ] = 0.Thus, h = 0 or h = (2 sqrt(3)/b ) / (1/a² + 3 / b² ).Which is what I had before.So, h = (2 sqrt(3) a² b ) / (b² + 3 a² ).So, that seems correct.So, then, the coordinates of P are ( h, k ) = ( (2 sqrt(3) a² b ) / (b² + 3 a² ), b - sqrt(3) h ).Which is ( (2 sqrt(3) a² b ) / (b² + 3 a² ), b - sqrt(3)*(2 sqrt(3) a² b ) / (b² + 3 a² ) )Simplify the y-coordinate:b - (6 a² b ) / (b² + 3 a² ) = [ b (b² + 3 a² ) - 6 a² b ] / (b² + 3 a² )= [ b³ + 3 a² b - 6 a² b ] / (b² + 3 a² )= [ b³ - 3 a² b ] / (b² + 3 a² )= b (b² - 3 a² ) / (b² + 3 a² )So, that seems correct.So, then, points P and R are correctly determined.Now, the foci F₁(c, 0) and F₂(-c, 0) lie on sides QR and PQ, respectively.But when I plug F₁(c, 0) into QR's equation, which is y = sqrt(3) x + b, I get 0 = sqrt(3) c + b, which is impossible because both sqrt(3) c and b are positive.Similarly, plugging F₂(-c, 0) into PQ's equation y = -sqrt(3) x + b, we get 0 = sqrt(3) c + b, same issue.This suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong.Wait, perhaps the foci are not on the sides QR and PQ, but on the extensions of those sides? Or maybe I misapplied the condition.Wait, the problem says \\"foci F₁ and F₂ lie on sides QR and PQ, respectively.\\" So, they must lie on the sides, not their extensions.Hmm, so perhaps my mistake is in the equations of the sides.Wait, let me re-examine the equations of QR and PQ.Points Q(0, b), R(-h, k). So, the line QR goes from (0, b) to (-h, k). So, the slope is (k - b)/(-h - 0) = (k - b)/(-h). As before, k - b = -sqrt(3) h, so slope is sqrt(3). So, equation is y = sqrt(3) x + b.Similarly, PQ is from (0, b) to (h, k). So, slope is (k - b)/(h - 0) = (k - b)/h = (-sqrt(3) h)/h = -sqrt(3). So, equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + b.So, equations are correct.But then, plugging F₁(c, 0) into QR's equation gives 0 = sqrt(3) c + b, which is impossible.Wait, unless c is negative? But c is sqrt(a² - b²), which is positive.Alternatively, maybe I have the wrong orientation of the triangle.Wait, in the Asymptote code, the points are defined as:A = (-s/2,-sqrt(3)/2*(s - 5));B = (0,b);C = (s/2,-sqrt(3)/2*(s - 5));F[1] = (c,0);F[2] = (-c,0);So, in the Asymptote code, s is set to 8, a is 5, b is sqrt(3)/2 *5, which is approximately 4.33.So, points P and R are at (-4, -sqrt(3)/2*(8 -5)) and (4, -sqrt(3)/2*(8 -5)).Compute that: 8 -5 = 3, so y-coordinate is -sqrt(3)/2 *3 = (-3 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ -2.598.So, points P(-4, -2.598), Q(0, 4.33), R(4, -2.598).So, in this case, the triangle is oriented with base PR at the bottom, and Q at the top.So, in this case, the foci F₁ and F₂ are at (c, 0) and (-c, 0), which are on the x-axis.But in the Asymptote code, foci are drawn at (c, 0) and (-c, 0), which are on the sides QR and PQ.Wait, in the Asymptote code, the foci are drawn as F[1] = (c,0); F[2] = (-c,0); So, F₁ is on QR, and F₂ is on PQ.But according to the equations, plugging (c, 0) into QR's equation gives 0 = sqrt(3) c + b, which is impossible.Wait, but in the Asymptote code, s is set to 8, a is 5, b is sqrt(3)/2 *5, c is 5/2.So, let me compute sqrt(3) c + b.sqrt(3) * (5/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*5 = (5 sqrt(3))/2 + (5 sqrt(3))/2 = 5 sqrt(3). Which is about 8.66, not zero.So, in the Asymptote code, foci are at (2.5, 0) and (-2.5, 0), which are on the sides QR and PQ.But according to the equations, plugging (2.5, 0) into QR's equation y = sqrt(3) x + b, we get 0 = sqrt(3)*2.5 + 4.33.Compute sqrt(3)*2.5 ≈ 4.33, so 4.33 + 4.33 ≈ 8.66, which is not zero.Wait, that can't be. So, something is wrong here.Wait, maybe in the Asymptote code, the ellipse is scaled by a and b, so the actual coordinates are scaled.Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawn as yscale(b)*xscale(a)*Circle((0,0),1). So, the ellipse is created by scaling the unit circle by a in x and b in y.But then, the points P, Q, R are defined as:A = (-s/2,-sqrt(3)/2*(s - 5));B = (0,b);C = (s/2,-sqrt(3)/2*(s - 5));So, with s =8, A is (-4, -sqrt(3)/2*(3)) = (-4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ), and C is (4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ).So, in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are already in the scaled system, so the ellipse is x²/a² + y²/b² =1, with a=5, b= (sqrt(3)/2)*5.So, in this specific case, a=5, b= (5 sqrt(3))/2, c= sqrt(a² - b²)= sqrt(25 - (75/4))= sqrt(25 -18.75)= sqrt(6.25)=2.5.So, foci at (2.5, 0) and (-2.5, 0).Now, in the Asymptote code, the points are:P(-4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ), Q(0, (5 sqrt(3))/2 ), R(4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ).So, let's check if F₁(2.5, 0) lies on QR.QR is from Q(0, (5 sqrt(3))/2 ) to R(4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ).Let me compute the equation of QR.Slope m = [ - (3 sqrt(3))/2 - (5 sqrt(3))/2 ] / (4 - 0 ) = [ (-8 sqrt(3))/2 ] /4 = (-4 sqrt(3))/4 = -sqrt(3).Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation.Wait, in my earlier calculation, I thought the slope was sqrt(3), but in reality, in the Asymptote code, the slope is negative sqrt(3).Wait, that's conflicting.Wait, in my initial reasoning, I thought that since PR is parallel to the x-axis, and P is at (h, k), R at (-h, k), then QR would have a positive slope.But in the Asymptote code, the slope is negative.So, perhaps I made a mistake in the orientation.Wait, in the Asymptote code, point P is at (-s/2, -sqrt(3)/2*(s -5)), which with s=8, is (-4, -sqrt(3)/2*(3)) = (-4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ). Similarly, R is at (4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ).So, point Q is at (0, b) = (0, (5 sqrt(3))/2 ).So, QR is from (0, (5 sqrt(3))/2 ) to (4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ).So, the slope is [ - (3 sqrt(3))/2 - (5 sqrt(3))/2 ] / (4 - 0 ) = [ (-8 sqrt(3))/2 ] /4 = (-4 sqrt(3))/4 = -sqrt(3).So, the slope is -sqrt(3), not sqrt(3) as I previously thought.Similarly, PQ is from (0, (5 sqrt(3))/2 ) to (-4, - (3 sqrt(3))/2 ).Slope is [ - (3 sqrt(3))/2 - (5 sqrt(3))/2 ] / (-4 - 0 ) = [ (-8 sqrt(3))/2 ] / (-4 ) = (-4 sqrt(3))/(-4 ) = sqrt(3).So, in reality, the slope of QR is -sqrt(3), and the slope of PQ is sqrt(3).Therefore, my earlier assumption about the slopes was incorrect. I had the signs reversed.So, correcting that, the equation of QR is:From Q(0, b) to R(h, k), slope is -sqrt(3). So, equation is y - b = -sqrt(3)(x - 0 ), so y = -sqrt(3) x + b.Similarly, equation of PQ is from Q(0, b) to P(-h, k), slope is sqrt(3). So, equation is y - b = sqrt(3)(x - 0 ), so y = sqrt(3) x + b.Wait, that makes more sense because in the Asymptote code, the foci are at (2.5, 0) and (-2.5, 0). So, plugging F₁(2.5, 0) into QR's equation:0 = -sqrt(3)*2.5 + b.Similarly, plugging F₂(-2.5, 0) into PQ's equation:0 = sqrt(3)*(-2.5) + b.So, both give 0 = -sqrt(3) c + b, where c =2.5.So, in this specific case, b = sqrt(3) c.Given that in the Asymptote code, a=5, b= (5 sqrt(3))/2, c=2.5.Indeed, b = (5 sqrt(3))/2, and sqrt(3) c = sqrt(3)*2.5 = (5 sqrt(3))/2, which is equal to b. So, that works.So, in general, for the problem, we have that foci lie on sides QR and PQ, so plugging F₁(c, 0) into QR's equation:0 = -sqrt(3) c + b => b = sqrt(3) c.Similarly, plugging F₂(-c, 0) into PQ's equation:0 = sqrt(3)*(-c) + b => 0 = -sqrt(3) c + b => same as above.So, the condition is that b = sqrt(3) c.But in an ellipse, c = sqrt(a² - b²).So, substituting c = sqrt(a² - b²) into b = sqrt(3) c:b = sqrt(3) sqrt(a² - b²).Square both sides:b² = 3(a² - b²).So,b² = 3 a² - 3 b².Bring terms together:b² + 3 b² = 3 a² => 4 b² = 3 a² => b² = (3/4) a² => b = (sqrt(3)/2) a.So, this is a key relation: b = (sqrt(3)/2) a.So, the semi-minor axis is (sqrt(3)/2) times the semi-major axis.So, now, with this relation, we can express everything in terms of a.Given that, let's recall that c = sqrt(a² - b²) = sqrt(a² - (3/4) a² ) = sqrt( (1/4) a² ) = (a)/2.So, c = a/2.Therefore, the foci are at (±a/2, 0).So, now, with this, let's go back to the coordinates of points P and R.Earlier, we had:h = (2 sqrt(3) a² b ) / (b² + 3 a² )But since b = (sqrt(3)/2) a, let's substitute that:h = (2 sqrt(3) a² * (sqrt(3)/2) a ) / ( ( (3/4) a² ) + 3 a² )Simplify numerator:2 sqrt(3) * (sqrt(3)/2) = (2 * 3)/2 = 3.So, numerator: 3 a³.Denominator:(3/4 a² + 3 a² ) = (3/4 + 3) a² = (3/4 + 12/4) a² = (15/4) a².Thus,h = (3 a³ ) / (15/4 a² ) = (3 a³ ) * (4 /15 a² ) = (12 a ) /15 = (4 a)/5.So, h = (4 a)/5.Similarly, k = b (b² - 3 a² ) / (b² + 3 a² ).Again, substitute b = (sqrt(3)/2) a.Compute numerator:b (b² - 3 a² ) = (sqrt(3)/2 a ) [ ( (3/4) a² ) - 3 a² ] = (sqrt(3)/2 a ) [ (3/4 - 3 ) a² ] = (sqrt(3)/2 a ) [ (-9/4 ) a² ] = (-9 sqrt(3)/8 ) a³.Denominator:b² + 3 a² = (3/4 a² ) + 3 a² = (3/4 + 3 ) a² = (15/4 ) a².Thus,k = ( -9 sqrt(3)/8 a³ ) / (15/4 a² ) = ( -9 sqrt(3)/8 a³ ) * (4 /15 a² ) = ( -9 sqrt(3)/8 * 4 /15 ) a = ( -9 sqrt(3)/30 ) a = (-3 sqrt(3)/10 ) a.So, k = (-3 sqrt(3)/10 ) a.Therefore, points P and R are:P = ( h, k ) = ( (4 a)/5, (-3 sqrt(3)/10 ) a )R = ( -h, k ) = ( - (4 a)/5, (-3 sqrt(3)/10 ) a )So, now, we can compute the length PQ.Points P(4a/5, -3 sqrt(3) a /10 ) and Q(0, b ) = (0, sqrt(3)/2 a ).Compute the distance PQ:sqrt[ (4a/5 - 0 )² + ( -3 sqrt(3) a /10 - sqrt(3)/2 a )² ]Simplify each component:x-component: (4a/5 )² = 16 a² /25.y-component: ( -3 sqrt(3) a /10 - sqrt(3)/2 a ) = ( -3 sqrt(3) a /10 - 5 sqrt(3) a /10 ) = (-8 sqrt(3) a /10 ) = (-4 sqrt(3) a /5 ).Thus, y-component squared: ( -4 sqrt(3) a /5 )² = 16 * 3 a² /25 = 48 a² /25.Therefore, PQ = sqrt(16 a² /25 + 48 a² /25 ) = sqrt(64 a² /25 ) = (8 a)/5.So, PQ = 8a/5.Now, the distance between foci F₁ and F₂ is F₁F₂ = 2c = 2*(a/2 ) = a.Therefore, the ratio PQ / F₁F₂ = (8a/5 ) / a = 8/5.So, the ratio is 8/5.**Final Answer**boxed{dfrac{8}{5}}"},{"question":"Given the vectors vec{a}={2,3} and vec{b}={3,-2}, the angle between the vectors k vec{a}+vec{b} and vec{a}+k vec{b} is 60^{circ}. Find the real number k.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the real number ( k ) such that the angle between the vectors ( kvec{a} + vec{b} ) and ( vec{a} + kvec{b} ) is ( 60^circ ). The vectors given are ( vec{a} = {2, 3} ) and ( vec{b} = {3, -2} ). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the angle ( theta ) between two vectors ( vec{u} ) and ( vec{v} ) can be found using the dot product formula:[costheta = frac{vec{u} cdot vec{v}}{||vec{u}|| , ||vec{v}||}]Since the angle is given as ( 60^circ ), I know that ( cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2} ). So, I can set up the equation:[frac{(kvec{a} + vec{b}) cdot (vec{a} + kvec{b})}{||kvec{a} + vec{b}|| , ||vec{a} + kvec{b}||} = frac{1}{2}]Alright, so my goal is to compute the numerator and the denominator, set up the equation, and solve for ( k ). Let me break this down step by step.**Step 1: Compute the dot product ( (kvec{a} + vec{b}) cdot (vec{a} + kvec{b}) ).**First, let me write out ( kvec{a} + vec{b} ) and ( vec{a} + kvec{b} ):- ( kvec{a} = k times {2, 3} = {2k, 3k} )- So, ( kvec{a} + vec{b} = {2k + 3, 3k - 2} )Similarly,- ( kvec{b} = k times {3, -2} = {3k, -2k} )- So, ( vec{a} + kvec{b} = {2 + 3k, 3 - 2k} )Now, the dot product is:[(kvec{a} + vec{b}) cdot (vec{a} + kvec{b}) = (2k + 3)(2 + 3k) + (3k - 2)(3 - 2k)]Let me compute each part separately.First part: ( (2k + 3)(2 + 3k) )Expanding this:[2k times 2 + 2k times 3k + 3 times 2 + 3 times 3k = 4k + 6k^2 + 6 + 9k]Combine like terms:- ( 6k^2 )- ( 4k + 9k = 13k )- ( 6 )So, first part is ( 6k^2 + 13k + 6 )Second part: ( (3k - 2)(3 - 2k) )Expanding this:[3k times 3 + 3k times (-2k) - 2 times 3 - 2 times (-2k) = 9k - 6k^2 - 6 + 4k]Combine like terms:- ( -6k^2 )- ( 9k + 4k = 13k )- ( -6 )So, second part is ( -6k^2 + 13k - 6 )Now, add both parts together:First part: ( 6k^2 + 13k + 6 )Second part: ( -6k^2 + 13k - 6 )Adding them:- ( 6k^2 - 6k^2 = 0 )- ( 13k + 13k = 26k )- ( 6 - 6 = 0 )So, the dot product simplifies to ( 26k ). Hmm, that's interesting. So, the numerator is ( 26k ).**Step 2: Compute the magnitudes ( ||kvec{a} + vec{b}|| ) and ( ||vec{a} + kvec{b}|| ).**Let's start with ( ||kvec{a} + vec{b}|| ).We already have ( kvec{a} + vec{b} = {2k + 3, 3k - 2} ).The magnitude squared is:[(2k + 3)^2 + (3k - 2)^2]Compute each term:First term: ( (2k + 3)^2 = 4k^2 + 12k + 9 )Second term: ( (3k - 2)^2 = 9k^2 - 12k + 4 )Adding them together:- ( 4k^2 + 9k^2 = 13k^2 )- ( 12k - 12k = 0 )- ( 9 + 4 = 13 )So, the magnitude squared is ( 13k^2 + 13 = 13(k^2 + 1) ). Therefore, the magnitude is ( sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)} ).Similarly, compute ( ||vec{a} + kvec{b}|| ).We have ( vec{a} + kvec{b} = {2 + 3k, 3 - 2k} ).The magnitude squared is:[(2 + 3k)^2 + (3 - 2k)^2]Compute each term:First term: ( (2 + 3k)^2 = 4 + 12k + 9k^2 )Second term: ( (3 - 2k)^2 = 9 - 12k + 4k^2 )Adding them together:- ( 9k^2 + 4k^2 = 13k^2 )- ( 12k - 12k = 0 )- ( 4 + 9 = 13 )So, the magnitude squared is ( 13k^2 + 13 = 13(k^2 + 1) ). Therefore, the magnitude is also ( sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)} ).Wait, that's interesting. Both vectors ( kvec{a} + vec{b} ) and ( vec{a} + kvec{b} ) have the same magnitude, which is ( sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)} ).**Step 3: Plug everything back into the cosine formula.**We have:[costheta = frac{26k}{sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)} times sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)}}]Simplify the denominator:[sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)} times sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)} = 13(k^2 + 1)]So, the equation becomes:[frac{26k}{13(k^2 + 1)} = frac{1}{2}]Simplify the left side:[frac{26k}{13(k^2 + 1)} = frac{2k}{k^2 + 1}]So, we have:[frac{2k}{k^2 + 1} = frac{1}{2}]**Step 4: Solve for ( k ).**Cross-multiplying:[2k times 2 = 1 times (k^2 + 1)]Simplify:[4k = k^2 + 1]Bring all terms to one side:[k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0]This is a quadratic equation in the form ( k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0 ). Let's solve for ( k ) using the quadratic formula.The quadratic formula is:[k = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}]Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -4 ), and ( c = 1 ). Plugging these in:[k = frac{-(-4) pm sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 times 1 times 1}}{2 times 1} = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2}]Simplify ( sqrt{12} ):[sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}]So,[k = frac{4 pm 2sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{3}]Therefore, the solutions are ( k = 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( k = 2 - sqrt{3} ).**Step 5: Verify the solutions.**Wait a second, I should check if these solutions are valid because sometimes when we square or manipulate equations, we might introduce extraneous solutions.Let me plug ( k = 2 + sqrt{3} ) back into the original vectors and check the angle.But before that, let me compute the dot product and magnitudes again with ( k = 2 + sqrt{3} ):Compute ( kvec{a} + vec{b} ):- ( 2k = 2(2 + sqrt{3}) = 4 + 2sqrt{3} )- ( 3k = 3(2 + sqrt{3}) = 6 + 3sqrt{3} )- So, ( kvec{a} + vec{b} = {4 + 2sqrt{3} + 3, 6 + 3sqrt{3} - 2} = {7 + 2sqrt{3}, 4 + 3sqrt{3}} )Compute ( vec{a} + kvec{b} ):- ( 3k = 3(2 + sqrt{3}) = 6 + 3sqrt{3} )- ( -2k = -2(2 + sqrt{3}) = -4 - 2sqrt{3} )- So, ( vec{a} + kvec{b} = {2 + 6 + 3sqrt{3}, 3 - 4 - 2sqrt{3}} = {8 + 3sqrt{3}, -1 - 2sqrt{3}} )Now, compute the dot product:[(7 + 2sqrt{3})(8 + 3sqrt{3}) + (4 + 3sqrt{3})(-1 - 2sqrt{3})]This seems complicated, but let me compute each part:First part: ( (7 + 2sqrt{3})(8 + 3sqrt{3}) )Multiply:[7 times 8 + 7 times 3sqrt{3} + 2sqrt{3} times 8 + 2sqrt{3} times 3sqrt{3}][= 56 + 21sqrt{3} + 16sqrt{3} + 6 times 3][= 56 + 37sqrt{3} + 18][= 74 + 37sqrt{3}]Second part: ( (4 + 3sqrt{3})(-1 - 2sqrt{3}) )Multiply:[4 times (-1) + 4 times (-2sqrt{3}) + 3sqrt{3} times (-1) + 3sqrt{3} times (-2sqrt{3})][= -4 - 8sqrt{3} - 3sqrt{3} - 6 times 3][= -4 - 11sqrt{3} - 18][= -22 - 11sqrt{3}]Now, add both parts:First part: ( 74 + 37sqrt{3} )Second part: ( -22 - 11sqrt{3} )Adding:[74 - 22 + 37sqrt{3} - 11sqrt{3} = 52 + 26sqrt{3}]Wait, but earlier, we had the dot product as ( 26k ). Let's compute ( 26k ) with ( k = 2 + sqrt{3} ):[26 times (2 + sqrt{3}) = 52 + 26sqrt{3}]Yes, that matches. So, the dot product is correct.Now, compute the magnitudes:We already know that each magnitude is ( sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)} ). Let's compute ( k^2 ):( k = 2 + sqrt{3} ), so ( k^2 = (2 + sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4sqrt{3} )So, ( k^2 + 1 = 8 + 4sqrt{3} )Thus, the magnitude is ( sqrt{13(8 + 4sqrt{3})} ). Let me compute this:First, compute ( 8 + 4sqrt{3} approx 8 + 6.928 = 14.928 )So, ( 13 times 14.928 approx 194.064 ), and the square root is approximately ( 13.928 ).But let me compute it exactly:Wait, ( 13(8 + 4sqrt{3}) = 104 + 52sqrt{3} ). Hmm, not sure if that's a perfect square. Maybe not necessary, since we already know the dot product is ( 52 + 26sqrt{3} ), and the product of the magnitudes is ( 13(k^2 + 1) = 13(8 + 4sqrt{3}) ).So, let's compute ( costheta ):[costheta = frac{52 + 26sqrt{3}}{13(8 + 4sqrt{3})} = frac{26(2 + sqrt{3})}{13 times 4(2 + sqrt{3})} = frac{26}{52} = frac{1}{2}]Yes, that's correct. So, ( costheta = frac{1}{2} ), which corresponds to ( 60^circ ). So, ( k = 2 + sqrt{3} ) is a valid solution.Now, let me check ( k = 2 - sqrt{3} ).Compute ( kvec{a} + vec{b} ):- ( 2k = 2(2 - sqrt{3}) = 4 - 2sqrt{3} )- ( 3k = 3(2 - sqrt{3}) = 6 - 3sqrt{3} )- So, ( kvec{a} + vec{b} = {4 - 2sqrt{3} + 3, 6 - 3sqrt{3} - 2} = {7 - 2sqrt{3}, 4 - 3sqrt{3}} )Compute ( vec{a} + kvec{b} ):- ( 3k = 3(2 - sqrt{3}) = 6 - 3sqrt{3} )- ( -2k = -2(2 - sqrt{3}) = -4 + 2sqrt{3} )- So, ( vec{a} + kvec{b} = {2 + 6 - 3sqrt{3}, 3 - 4 + 2sqrt{3}} = {8 - 3sqrt{3}, -1 + 2sqrt{3}} )Compute the dot product:[(7 - 2sqrt{3})(8 - 3sqrt{3}) + (4 - 3sqrt{3})(-1 + 2sqrt{3})]First part: ( (7 - 2sqrt{3})(8 - 3sqrt{3}) )Multiply:[7 times 8 + 7 times (-3sqrt{3}) - 2sqrt{3} times 8 + 2sqrt{3} times 3sqrt{3}][= 56 - 21sqrt{3} - 16sqrt{3} + 6 times 3][= 56 - 37sqrt{3} + 18][= 74 - 37sqrt{3}]Second part: ( (4 - 3sqrt{3})(-1 + 2sqrt{3}) )Multiply:[4 times (-1) + 4 times 2sqrt{3} - 3sqrt{3} times (-1) + (-3sqrt{3}) times 2sqrt{3}][= -4 + 8sqrt{3} + 3sqrt{3} - 6 times 3][= -4 + 11sqrt{3} - 18][= -22 + 11sqrt{3}]Now, add both parts:First part: ( 74 - 37sqrt{3} )Second part: ( -22 + 11sqrt{3} )Adding:[74 - 22 - 37sqrt{3} + 11sqrt{3} = 52 - 26sqrt{3}]Compute ( 26k ) with ( k = 2 - sqrt{3} ):[26 times (2 - sqrt{3}) = 52 - 26sqrt{3}]So, the dot product is correct.Now, compute the magnitudes:Again, each magnitude is ( sqrt{13(k^2 + 1)} ). Compute ( k^2 ):( k = 2 - sqrt{3} ), so ( k^2 = (2 - sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 4sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 - 4sqrt{3} )Thus, ( k^2 + 1 = 8 - 4sqrt{3} )So, the magnitude is ( sqrt{13(8 - 4sqrt{3})} ). Let's compute ( costheta ):[costheta = frac{52 - 26sqrt{3}}{13(8 - 4sqrt{3})} = frac{26(2 - sqrt{3})}{13 times 4(2 - sqrt{3})} = frac{26}{52} = frac{1}{2}]Again, ( costheta = frac{1}{2} ), so ( theta = 60^circ ). Therefore, ( k = 2 - sqrt{3} ) is also a valid solution.**Conclusion:**Both ( k = 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( k = 2 - sqrt{3} ) satisfy the given condition that the angle between the vectors ( kvec{a} + vec{b} ) and ( vec{a} + kvec{b} ) is ( 60^circ ). Therefore, these are the real numbers ( k ) that solve the problem.**Final Answer**The real numbers ( k ) are ( boxed{2 + sqrt{3}} ) and ( boxed{2 - sqrt{3}} )."},{"question":"Xiaolan adds consecutive even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, dots) and obtains the result 2012. Upon verification, it is found that one number was omitted. What is the missing number? _______ .","answer":"Okay, so Xiaolan is adding consecutive even numbers starting from 2, like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. She got a total of 2012, but it turns out one number was missing. I need to figure out which number is missing. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that the sum of consecutive even numbers can be calculated using a formula. Let me recall... I think the sum of the first n even numbers is n(n + 1). Wait, is that right? Let me check with a small example. If n = 3, the sum is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. Using the formula, 3(3 + 1) = 12. Yeah, that works. So, the formula is correct.So, if Xiaolan had added all the numbers correctly, the sum would be n(n + 1). But she got 2012, which is less than the actual sum because one number was omitted. That means the actual sum should be 2012 plus the missing number. Let me denote the missing number as x. So, n(n + 1) = 2012 + x.But wait, I don't know what n is. I need to find n first. Since the sum without the missing number is 2012, n(n + 1) must be just a bit more than 2012. Let me solve for n approximately.So, n(n + 1) ≈ 2012. Let's approximate this quadratic equation. n² + n - 2012 ≈ 0. Using the quadratic formula, n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*2012)] / 2. Calculating the discriminant: sqrt(1 + 8048) = sqrt(8049). Hmm, sqrt(8100) is 90, so sqrt(8049) is a bit less, maybe around 89.7. So, n ≈ (-1 + 89.7)/2 ≈ 44.35. So, n is approximately 44.35, which suggests that n is either 44 or 45.Let me check n = 44: 44*45 = 1980. Hmm, that's less than 2012. Then n = 45: 45*46 = 2070. Okay, so the actual sum should be 2070 if all numbers up to 45th even number were added. But Xiaolan got 2012, which is 2070 - 2012 = 58 less. So, does that mean the missing number is 58? Wait, but 58 is the 29th even number, right? Because 2*29 = 58. Hmm, but let me make sure.Wait, hold on. The sum without the missing number is 2012, and the actual sum is 2070, so the difference is 58. So, the missing number should be 58. But let me verify this.If the sum up to 45 terms is 2070, and if one number is missing, the sum would be 2070 - x = 2012. So, x = 2070 - 2012 = 58. So, yes, 58 is the missing number.But wait, let me think again. Is 58 actually part of the first 45 even numbers? The 45th even number is 2*45 = 90. So, 58 is definitely within that range. So, that seems correct.But just to be thorough, let me check the sum up to 45 terms. The sum is 45*46 = 2070. If 58 is missing, then 2070 - 58 = 2012, which matches what Xiaolan got. So, that seems consistent.But wait, another thought: is there another possible n? Because n was approximately 44.35, so n could be 44 or 45. Let me check n = 44. The sum is 44*45 = 1980. If Xiaolan got 2012, which is higher than 1980, that would mean that she actually added more numbers, which contradicts the initial statement that one number was omitted. So, n must be 45, because 45*46 = 2070 is higher than 2012, and the difference is the missing number.Therefore, the missing number is 58. Hmm, that seems solid.Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first n even numbers is indeed n(n + 1). So, if one number is missing, the sum is n(n + 1) - x = 2012. So, x = n(n + 1) - 2012. We need to find n such that n(n + 1) is just above 2012.As I did before, n ≈ sqrt(2012) ≈ 44.86, so n is 45. So, x = 45*46 - 2012 = 2070 - 2012 = 58. Yep, same result.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the average. The average of the numbers from 2 to 2n is (2 + 2n)/2 = n + 1. So, the sum is n(n + 1). If one number is missing, the sum is 2012, so n(n + 1) - x = 2012. So, x = n(n + 1) - 2012.Again, same equation. So, solving for n, as before, n is 45, x is 58.Wait, but another thought: is 58 the only possible missing number? Or could there be another n where n(n + 1) - x = 2012, with x being another number?Let me suppose that n is 46. Then the sum would be 46*47 = 2162. Then, x would be 2162 - 2012 = 150. But 150 is the 75th even number, which is beyond the first 46 even numbers. So, that can't be, because the numbers are consecutive starting from 2, so the 46th even number is 92. So, 150 is not in the first 46 numbers. So, that's not possible.Similarly, if n is 43, sum is 43*44 = 1892. Then, x = 1892 - 2012 = negative, which doesn't make sense. So, n must be 45.Therefore, the missing number is 58.But just to make sure, let me list the first few even numbers and see if 58 is indeed one of them. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, ..., 90. Yeah, 58 is the 29th even number, so it's definitely in the first 45 even numbers.Therefore, I'm confident that the missing number is 58.**Final Answer**The missing number is boxed{58}."},{"question":"Suppose there is a population of 1650 individuals. To perform systematic sampling, a sample of size 35 is to be drawn from it. When segmenting, ________ individuals should be randomly removed from the population, which should then be divided into ________ segments, each with ________ individuals.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about systematic sampling. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The population is 1650 individuals, and we need to draw a sample of size 35. Hmm, systematic sampling... I remember it's a method where you select every k-th individual from a list. But first, I think we need to divide the population into segments or something like that.Wait, the question is asking about segmenting. It says, \\"When segmenting, ________ individuals should be randomly removed from the population, which should then be divided into ________ segments, each with ________ individuals.\\" So, I need to fill in three blanks: the number of individuals to remove, the number of segments, and the size of each segment.Let me recall how systematic sampling works. First, you determine the sampling interval, which is usually calculated as the population size divided by the sample size. So, k = N / n, where N is the population size and n is the sample size. In this case, N is 1650 and n is 35. So, k would be 1650 / 35.Let me compute that. 1650 divided by 35. Hmm, 35 times 40 is 1400, and 35 times 47 is 1645 because 35*40=1400, 35*7=245, so 1400+245=1645. Then 1650 - 1645 is 5. So, 35*47=1645, and 1650 is 5 more. So, 1650 / 35 is 47 with a remainder of 5. So, k is 47.142... approximately.But in systematic sampling, we usually need an integer interval. So, if the division doesn't come out even, we might have to adjust. I think one way is to randomly remove some individuals so that the population size is divisible by the sample size. That way, each segment will have an equal number of individuals.So, if N is 1650 and n is 35, and 1650 divided by 35 is 47 with a remainder of 5, that means we have 5 extra individuals. So, to make it divisible, we need to remove those 5 individuals. Therefore, we should randomly remove 5 individuals from the population.Once we remove 5 individuals, the population size becomes 1650 - 5 = 1645. Now, 1645 divided by 35 is exactly 47, because 35*47=1645. So, now we can divide the population into 35 segments, each with 47 individuals.Wait, let me double-check. If we remove 5 individuals, the new population is 1645. Divided by 35 segments, each segment has 47. That makes sense because 35*47=1645. So, each segment has 47 individuals.So, putting it all together: we randomly remove 5 individuals, then divide the population into 35 segments, each with 47 individuals.Let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. Sometimes in systematic sampling, you can also use a circular method where you treat the list as circular, but in this case, since the population isn't perfectly divisible, removing the extra individuals seems like the right approach.Alternatively, another method is to calculate the interval as the ceiling of N/n, but that might lead to a different number of segments or unequal segments. But in this case, since the question is specifically about segmenting, it's more about dividing into equal segments, which requires the population size to be a multiple of the sample size. Hence, removing the remainder makes sense.So, yeah, I think the blanks should be filled with 5, 35, and 47.**Final Answer**When segmenting, boxed{5} individuals should be randomly removed from the population, which should then be divided into boxed{35} segments, each with boxed{47} individuals."},{"question":"Ben's potato gun can launch a potato 6 football fields. If a football field is 200 yards long and Ben's dog can run 400 feet/minute, how many minutes will it take his dog to fetch a potato he launches?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total distance the potato travels. Ben's potato gun can launch a potato 6 football fields, and each football field is 200 yards long. So, the total distance is 6 multiplied by 200 yards, which equals 1200 yards.Next, I need to convert this distance into feet because the dog's speed is given in feet per minute. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, 1200 yards is equivalent to 1200 multiplied by 3, resulting in 3600 feet.Now, with the distance in feet and the dog's speed known, I can calculate the time it takes for the dog to fetch the potato. The dog runs at 400 feet per minute, so the time is the total distance divided by the speed. That is, 3600 feet divided by 400 feet per minute, which equals 9 minutes.Therefore, it will take Ben's dog 9 minutes to fetch the potato."},{"question":"Calculate: sqrt{(-5)^{2}}+sqrt[3]{-27}-left(-1right)^{2}.","answer":"First, I need to calculate each part of the expression separately.Starting with the square root of (-5) squared, I know that squaring a negative number results in a positive number.

The cube root of a negative number is also negative, and since (-3) cubed equals -27, the cube root of -27 is -3.Finally, I'll evaluate (-1) squared.

Find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that whenever ( T ) is triangular, ( 81 T + k ) is also triangular.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: A positive integer ( T ) is called triangular if ( T = 1 + 2 + cdots + n ) for some positive integer ( n ). I need to find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that whenever ( T ) is triangular, ( 81T + k ) is also triangular. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.First, I remember that triangular numbers have a formula. The ( n )-th triangular number is given by ( T_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). So, if ( T ) is triangular, then ( T = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ) for some ( n ). The problem says that ( 81T + k ) should also be triangular. So, ( 81T + k = frac{m(m+1)}{2} ) for some positive integer ( m ).So, substituting ( T ) into this equation, we get:[81 cdot frac{n(n+1)}{2} + k = frac{m(m+1)}{2}]Let me write that down more clearly:[frac{81n(n+1)}{2} + k = frac{m(m+1)}{2}]To make this easier, maybe I can eliminate the denominators by multiplying both sides by 2:[81n(n+1) + 2k = m(m+1)]So, now we have:[m(m+1) = 81n(n+1) + 2k]Our goal is to find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that this equation holds for all triangular numbers ( T ), which corresponds to all positive integers ( n ).Hmm, so I need this equation to hold for any ( n ). That suggests that ( m ) should be a function of ( n ), right? Maybe ( m ) is some multiple of ( n ) or something like that. Let me think about how ( m ) relates to ( n ).Given that ( 81 ) is a square number, specifically ( 9^2 ), perhaps ( m ) is related to ( 9n ) or something similar. Let me test this idea.Suppose ( m = 9n + c ), where ( c ) is some constant. Let's substitute this into the equation:[(9n + c)(9n + c + 1) = 81n(n+1) + 2k]Let me expand the left side:[(9n + c)(9n + c + 1) = (9n + c)(9n + c) + (9n + c)]Which is:[(81n^2 + 18cn + c^2) + (9n + c) = 81n^2 + (18c + 9)n + (c^2 + c)]So, the left side becomes:[81n^2 + (18c + 9)n + (c^2 + c)]And the right side is:[81n(n + 1) + 2k = 81n^2 + 81n + 2k]So, setting both sides equal:[81n^2 + (18c + 9)n + (c^2 + c) = 81n^2 + 81n + 2k]Subtracting ( 81n^2 ) from both sides, we get:[(18c + 9)n + (c^2 + c) = 81n + 2k]Now, let's equate the coefficients of like terms. First, the coefficients of ( n ):[18c + 9 = 81]Solving for ( c ):[18c = 81 - 9 = 72 c = 72 / 18 = 4]So, ( c = 4 ). Now, let's check the constant terms:[c^2 + c = 2k 4^2 + 4 = 2k 16 + 4 = 2k 20 = 2k k = 10]So, according to this, ( k = 10 ). Hmm, that seems straightforward. But wait, let me verify this because sometimes when you make assumptions, you might miss something.Let me test this with a specific triangular number. Let's take ( n = 1 ). Then, ( T = 1 ). So, ( 81T + k = 81 + 10 = 91 ). Is 91 a triangular number? Let's check.The formula for triangular numbers is ( T_m = frac{m(m+1)}{2} ). Let's solve for ( m ) when ( T_m = 91 ):[frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 91 m(m+1) = 182]Looking for integers ( m ) such that ( m^2 + m - 182 = 0 ). Using quadratic formula:[m = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 728}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{729}}{2} = frac{-1 pm 27}{2}]So, ( m = frac{26}{2} = 13 ) or ( m = frac{-28}{2} = -14 ). Since ( m ) must be positive, ( m = 13 ). So, 91 is indeed the 13th triangular number. Good.Let me try another one, say ( n = 2 ). Then, ( T = 3 ). So, ( 81 times 3 + 10 = 243 + 10 = 253 ). Is 253 triangular?Solving ( frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 253 ):[m(m+1) = 506]Looking for ( m ) such that ( m^2 + m - 506 = 0 ). Quadratic formula:[m = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 2024}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{2025}}{2} = frac{-1 pm 45}{2}]So, ( m = frac{44}{2} = 22 ) or ( m = -23 ). So, ( m = 22 ), which is positive. Therefore, 253 is the 22nd triangular number. Nice.Wait, let me check ( n = 3 ). ( T = 6 ). Then, ( 81 times 6 + 10 = 486 + 10 = 496 ). Is 496 triangular?Solving ( frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 496 ):[m(m+1) = 992]Quadratic equation:[m^2 + m - 992 = 0 m = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 3968}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{3969}}{2} = frac{-1 pm 63}{2}]So, ( m = frac{62}{2} = 31 ) or ( m = -32 ). So, 31 is positive, so 496 is the 31st triangular number. Perfect.Hmm, seems like ( k = 10 ) is working for these cases. But wait, I should think about whether this works for all ( n ). Let me see.From earlier, I assumed that ( m = 9n + c ), and found ( c = 4 ), leading to ( k = 10 ). So, in general, for any ( n ), ( m = 9n + 4 ). Let me verify this.Given ( m = 9n + 4 ), then:[m(m + 1) = (9n + 4)(9n + 5) = 81n^2 + 45n + 36n + 20 = 81n^2 + 81n + 20]On the other hand, ( 81n(n + 1) + 2k = 81n^2 + 81n + 2k ). So, setting them equal:[81n^2 + 81n + 20 = 81n^2 + 81n + 2k 20 = 2k k = 10]So, yes, this holds for any ( n ). Therefore, ( k = 10 ) is indeed the value that satisfies the condition for all triangular numbers ( T ).But wait, I should check if there's a smaller positive integer ( k ) that could work. Because the problem asks for the smallest positive integer ( k ). So, is 10 the smallest possible?Let me think. Suppose ( k ) is smaller than 10, say ( k = 1 ). Then, ( 81T + 1 ) should be triangular. Let's test ( n = 1 ): ( 81 times 1 + 1 = 82 ). Is 82 triangular? Let's see.Solving ( frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 82 ):[m(m+1) = 164]Quadratic equation:[m^2 + m - 164 = 0 m = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 656}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{657}}{2}]But ( sqrt{657} ) is approximately 25.63, which is not an integer. So, 82 is not triangular. Therefore, ( k = 1 ) doesn't work.Similarly, let's try ( k = 2 ). For ( n = 1 ), ( 81 + 2 = 83 ). Is 83 triangular? Let's check.( frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 83 ):[m(m+1) = 166]Quadratic:[m^2 + m - 166 = 0 m = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 664}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{665}}{2}]Again, ( sqrt{665} ) is about 25.78, not integer. So, 83 isn't triangular.Continuing this way, for ( k = 3 ), ( 81 + 3 = 84 ). Is 84 triangular? Let's see.( frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 84 ):[m(m+1) = 168]Looking for integer ( m ):Check ( m = 12 ): ( 12 times 13 = 156 ) (too low)( m = 13 ): ( 13 times 14 = 182 ) (too high)So, 168 isn't achieved. Therefore, 84 isn't triangular.Wait, actually, 84 is a triangular number. Wait, hold on, ( T_{12} = 78 ), ( T_{13} = 91 ). So, 84 is between them, so it's not triangular. So, ( k = 3 ) doesn't work.Similarly, ( k = 4 ): ( 81 + 4 = 85 ). Is 85 triangular?( frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 85 ):[m(m+1) = 170]Looking for ( m ):( 13 times 14 = 182 ) (too high), ( 12 times 13 = 156 ) (too low). So, no, 85 isn't triangular.( k = 5 ): ( 81 + 5 = 86 ). Is 86 triangular?( m(m+1) = 172 ). ( 13 times 14 = 182 ), ( 12 times 13 = 156 ). 172 isn't achieved. So, no.( k = 6 ): ( 81 + 6 = 87 ). Is 87 triangular?( m(m+1) = 174 ). ( 13 times 14 = 182 ), ( 12 times 13 = 156 ). 174 isn't achieved. So, no.( k = 7 ): ( 81 + 7 = 88 ). Is 88 triangular?( m(m+1) = 176 ). ( 13 times 14 = 182 ), ( 12 times 13 = 156 ). 176 isn't achieved. So, no.( k = 8 ): ( 81 + 8 = 89 ). Is 89 triangular?( m(m+1) = 178 ). ( 13 times 14 = 182 ), ( 12 times 13 = 156 ). 178 isn't achieved. So, no.( k = 9 ): ( 81 + 9 = 90 ). Is 90 triangular?( m(m+1) = 180 ). Let's see, ( 13 times 14 = 182 ), ( 12 times 13 = 156 ). 180 isn't achieved. So, no.So, for ( k = 1 ) to ( 9 ), none of them work when ( n = 1 ). Therefore, ( k = 10 ) is indeed the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition for ( n = 1 ). Since we already proved that ( k = 10 ) works for all ( n ), that must be the answer.But just to be thorough, let me check ( k = 10 ) for another ( n ), say ( n = 4 ). Then, ( T = 10 ). So, ( 81 times 10 + 10 = 810 + 10 = 820 ). Is 820 triangular?Solving ( frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 820 ):[m(m+1) = 1640]Looking for ( m ):Let's approximate ( m approx sqrt{1640} approx 40.5 ). So, check ( m = 40 ): ( 40 times 41 = 1640 ). Perfect! So, ( m = 40 ). Therefore, 820 is the 40th triangular number. Nice.Another one: ( n = 5 ). ( T = 15 ). ( 81 times 15 + 10 = 1215 + 10 = 1225 ). Is 1225 triangular?( frac{m(m+1)}{2} = 1225 ):[m(m+1) = 2450]Approximate ( m approx sqrt{2450} approx 49.5 ). Check ( m = 49 ): ( 49 times 50 = 2450 ). So, yes, ( m = 49 ). Therefore, 1225 is the 49th triangular number. Perfect.Alright, so it seems consistent.

When does the equality occur?*Proposed by Dorlir Ahmeti, Albania*","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality problem to solve. It says that for non-negative real numbers x, y, z, if they satisfy the equation x² + y² + z² = x + y + z, then I need to prove that:( (x + 1)/√(x⁵ + x + 1) ) + ( (y + 1)/√(y⁵ + y + 1) ) + ( (z + 1)/√(z⁵ + z + 1) ) ≥ 3.And also, I need to find when equality occurs.Alright, let me start by understanding the given condition: x² + y² + z² = x + y + z. Hmm, this seems like a constraint that relates the squares of the variables to their linear terms. Maybe I can manipulate this equation to find some relationship or bound for x, y, z.Let me rearrange the equation:x² - x + y² - y + z² - z = 0.I can complete the square for each variable:For x: x² - x = x² - x + (1/4) - (1/4) = (x - 1/2)² - 1/4.Similarly for y and z:y² - y = (y - 1/2)² - 1/4,z² - z = (z - 1/2)² - 1/4.So substituting back into the equation:(x - 1/2)² - 1/4 + (y - 1/2)² - 1/4 + (z - 1/2)² - 1/4 = 0.Simplify:(x - 1/2)² + (y - 1/2)² + (z - 1/2)² - 3/4 = 0,Which implies:(x - 1/2)² + (y - 1/2)² + (z - 1/2)² = 3/4.So, the sum of the squares of (x - 1/2), (y - 1/2), and (z - 1/2) is equal to 3/4. That gives me some information about how x, y, z are distributed around 1/2.Since x, y, z are non-negative, each of them must be in some range. Let me think about the possible values each variable can take.If, for example, x is 0, then (0 - 1/2)² = 1/4. Similarly, if x is 1, then (1 - 1/2)² = 1/4. So, variables can vary between 0 and 1, but maybe even beyond? Wait, let's see.Wait, if x is greater than 1, say x = 2, then (2 - 1/2)² = (3/2)² = 9/4, which is 2.25, which is way larger than 3/4. But since the sum of all three squared terms is 3/4, each individual term can't be too large. So, each variable can't be too far from 1/2.Wait, actually, if one variable is large, the others have to compensate. But since all variables are non-negative, maybe each variable is bounded between 0 and 1? Let me check.Suppose x is greater than 1. Then, (x - 1/2)² is greater than (1 - 1/2)² = 1/4. Similarly, if x is less than 0, but since x is non-negative, that's not possible. So, the maximum any variable can be is such that (x - 1/2)² ≤ 3/4, so x - 1/2 ≤ sqrt(3)/2, so x ≤ 1/2 + sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 1.366. Similarly, the minimum is 1/2 - sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -0.366, but since x is non-negative, the minimum is 0.So, x, y, z are in [0, 1/2 + sqrt(3)/2], but since 1/2 + sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 1.366, which is greater than 1, but maybe in reality, they can't all be that large because the sum of their squares is equal to their sum.Wait, let's think about the case when all variables are equal. If x = y = z, then 3x² = 3x, so x² = x, so x = 0 or x = 1. So, x = y = z = 0 or 1. But if x = y = z = 0, then the sum is 0, which is equal to 0, but the left-hand side of the inequality would be 3*(0 + 1)/√(0 + 0 + 1) = 3*1/1 = 3, so equality holds. Similarly, if x = y = z = 1, then the sum is 3*1² = 3, which equals 3*1, so that's also valid. Then, the left-hand side would be 3*(1 + 1)/√(1 + 1 + 1) = 3*(2)/√3 ≈ 3.464, which is greater than 3. So, in this case, equality occurs when x = y = z = 0.Wait, but when x = y = z = 0, the expression is 3, which is the lower bound. So, maybe the minimum is achieved at x = y = z = 0.But let me verify that. Let me plug in x = y = z = 0 into the given condition: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 + 0, which is true. So, that's a valid case.But also, when x = y = z = 1, the condition is 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1, which is also true. So, both cases are valid.But the expression when x = y = z = 0 is 3, and when x = y = z = 1, it's about 3.464, which is higher. So, maybe the minimum is 3, achieved at x = y = z = 0.But wait, is that the only case? Let me check another case.Suppose x = 1, y = z = 0. Then, the condition is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 + 0 + 0, which is true. Then, the expression becomes (1 + 1)/√(1 + 1 + 1) + (0 + 1)/√(0 + 0 + 1) + (0 + 1)/√(0 + 0 + 1) = 2/√3 + 1/1 + 1/1 ≈ 1.1547 + 1 + 1 = 3.1547, which is still greater than 3. So, the expression is higher than 3 here.Another case: x = 1/2, y = 1/2, z = 1/2. Then, x² + y² + z² = 3*(1/4) = 3/4, and x + y + z = 3/2. So, 3/4 ≠ 3/2, so this doesn't satisfy the condition. So, that's not a valid case.Wait, so maybe variables can't all be 1/2. Hmm.Wait, let me think about the condition again: x² + y² + z² = x + y + z. So, for each variable, x² ≤ x, since x² + y² + z² = x + y + z, and all variables are non-negative.So, x² ≤ x implies x(x - 1) ≤ 0, so x ∈ [0,1]. Similarly for y and z. So, each variable is between 0 and 1. That makes sense because if any variable is greater than 1, its square would be greater than itself, making the sum of squares greater than the sum of variables, which contradicts the given condition.So, all variables are in [0,1]. That's a useful piece of information.So, x, y, z ∈ [0,1]. So, each term in the expression is of the form (t + 1)/√(t⁵ + t + 1), where t ∈ [0,1].So, maybe I can analyze the function f(t) = (t + 1)/√(t⁵ + t + 1) for t ∈ [0,1], and see if it's convex or concave, or if it has some properties that can help me apply Jensen's inequality or something similar.First, let me compute f(t):f(t) = (t + 1)/√(t⁵ + t + 1).I can try to see if this function is convex or concave on [0,1]. If it's convex, then by Jensen's inequality, the sum would be greater than or equal to 3*f((x + y + z)/3). But I need to check the convexity.Alternatively, maybe I can find a lower bound for f(t). Let me see.Let me compute f(t) at t = 0: (0 + 1)/√(0 + 0 + 1) = 1/1 = 1.At t = 1: (1 + 1)/√(1 + 1 + 1) = 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547.So, f(t) increases from 1 to about 1.1547 as t goes from 0 to 1.Wait, but is f(t) increasing on [0,1]? Let me check the derivative.Compute f'(t):f(t) = (t + 1)/(t⁵ + t + 1)^{1/2}.Let me denote numerator as N = t + 1, denominator as D = (t⁵ + t + 1)^{1/2}.Then, f(t) = N/D.So, f'(t) = (N' D - N D') / D².Compute N' = 1.Compute D = (t⁵ + t + 1)^{1/2}, so D' = (1/2)(t⁵ + t + 1)^{-1/2}*(5t⁴ + 1).So, f'(t) = [1 * D - N * (1/2)(5t⁴ + 1)/D ] / D².Simplify numerator:= [D² - (N/2)(5t⁴ + 1)] / D³.Wait, let me write it step by step.f'(t) = [1 * (t⁵ + t + 1)^{1/2} - (t + 1) * (1/2)(5t⁴ + 1)(t⁵ + t + 1)^{-1/2}] / (t⁵ + t + 1).Factor out (t⁵ + t + 1)^{-1/2} from numerator:= [ (t⁵ + t + 1) - (t + 1)(5t⁴ + 1)/2 ] / (t⁵ + t + 1)^{3/2}.So, numerator becomes:2(t⁵ + t + 1) - (t + 1)(5t⁴ + 1) all over 2.Wait, let me compute the numerator:Numerator = (t⁵ + t + 1) - (t + 1)(5t⁴ + 1)/2.Let me compute (t + 1)(5t⁴ + 1):= t*(5t⁴ + 1) + 1*(5t⁴ + 1) = 5t⁵ + t + 5t⁴ + 1.So, numerator:= (t⁵ + t + 1) - (5t⁵ + t + 5t⁴ + 1)/2.Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate fraction:= 2(t⁵ + t + 1) - (5t⁵ + t + 5t⁴ + 1).= 2t⁵ + 2t + 2 - 5t⁵ - t - 5t⁴ - 1.Combine like terms:2t⁵ - 5t⁵ = -3t⁵,2t - t = t,2 - 1 = 1,-5t⁴.So, numerator = -3t⁵ -5t⁴ + t + 1.Thus, f'(t) = (-3t⁵ -5t⁴ + t + 1) / [2(t⁵ + t + 1)^{3/2}].So, the sign of f'(t) is determined by the numerator: -3t⁵ -5t⁴ + t + 1.Let me denote g(t) = -3t⁵ -5t⁴ + t + 1.I need to find where g(t) is positive or negative on [0,1].Compute g(0) = 0 - 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 > 0.Compute g(1) = -3 -5 + 1 + 1 = -6 < 0.So, g(t) starts positive at t=0 and becomes negative at t=1. So, there must be some t in (0,1) where g(t) = 0, meaning f'(t) changes sign from positive to negative. So, f(t) is increasing up to that point and decreasing after that.Therefore, f(t) is not monotonic on [0,1], so Jensen's inequality may not be directly applicable unless we know more about the function.Alternatively, maybe I can find an inequality that relates (t + 1)/√(t⁵ + t + 1) to something simpler.Let me consider the denominator: √(t⁵ + t + 1). Maybe I can bound this from above to make the entire fraction larger.Wait, if I can find that √(t⁵ + t + 1) ≤ something, then 1/√(t⁵ + t + 1) ≥ 1/something, so the entire expression would be larger.Alternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz.Wait, let me think about the denominator: t⁵ + t + 1.Since t ∈ [0,1], t⁵ ≤ t, because t⁵ = t * t⁴, and t⁴ ≤ 1, so t⁵ ≤ t.Therefore, t⁵ + t + 1 ≤ t + t + 1 = 2t + 1.So, √(t⁵ + t + 1) ≤ √(2t + 1).Therefore, 1/√(t⁵ + t + 1) ≥ 1/√(2t + 1).Thus, f(t) = (t + 1)/√(t⁵ + t + 1) ≥ (t + 1)/√(2t + 1).So, now, the expression becomes:Sum_{cyc} (x + 1)/√(x⁵ + x + 1) ≥ Sum_{cyc} (x + 1)/√(2x + 1).So, if I can show that Sum_{cyc} (x + 1)/√(2x + 1) ≥ 3, then the original inequality would hold.But I'm not sure if this is helpful. Maybe I need a different approach.Wait, let me consider the function f(t) = (t + 1)/√(t⁵ + t + 1). Maybe I can show that f(t) ≥ 1 for all t ∈ [0,1]. If that's true, then the sum would be ≥ 3*1 = 3.Let me check f(t) at t=0: 1, at t=1: 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547, which is greater than 1. So, maybe f(t) ≥ 1 for all t ∈ [0,1].Let me see if that's true. Suppose f(t) ≥ 1.So, (t + 1)/√(t⁵ + t + 1) ≥ 1.Squaring both sides (since both sides are positive):(t + 1)² ≥ t⁵ + t + 1.Expand left side:t² + 2t + 1 ≥ t⁵ + t + 1.Subtract t + 1 from both sides:t² + t ≥ t⁵.So, t² + t - t⁵ ≥ 0.Factor t:t(t + 1 - t⁴) ≥ 0.Since t ≥ 0, we need t + 1 - t⁴ ≥ 0.So, t + 1 ≥ t⁴.Is this true for t ∈ [0,1]?At t=0: 0 + 1 = 1 ≥ 0, which is true.At t=1: 1 + 1 = 2 ≥ 1, which is true.What about in between? Let me see.Let me define h(t) = t⁴ - t - 1. We need to check if h(t) ≤ 0 for t ∈ [0,1].Compute h(0) = 0 - 0 -1 = -1 < 0.h(1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1 < 0.Compute derivative h’(t) = 4t³ -1.Set h’(t) = 0: 4t³ -1 =0 => t = (1/4)^{1/3} ≈ 0.63.So, h(t) has a critical point at t ≈ 0.63.Compute h(0.63):Approximately, 0.63⁴ ≈ 0.1575, 0.63 ≈ 0.63, so h(0.63) ≈ 0.1575 - 0.63 -1 ≈ -1.4725 < 0.So, h(t) is always negative on [0,1], meaning t⁴ - t -1 <0, so t +1 > t⁴.Therefore, t(t +1 - t⁴) ≥0, since t ≥0 and t +1 - t⁴ ≥0.Thus, f(t) ≥1 for all t ∈ [0,1].Therefore, each term in the sum is at least 1, so the total sum is at least 3.Hence, the inequality holds, and equality occurs when each term is equal to 1, which happens when (t +1)/√(t⁵ + t +1) =1, which implies t +1 = √(t⁵ + t +1). Squaring both sides, t² + 2t +1 = t⁵ + t +1, so t² + t = t⁵, which implies t(t +1) = t⁵.So, t⁵ - t² - t =0.Factor t:t(t⁴ - t -1)=0.So, t=0 or t⁴ - t -1=0.But t ∈ [0,1], so let's see if t⁴ - t -1=0 has a solution in [0,1].At t=0: -1 <0.At t=1: 1 -1 -1= -1 <0.So, t⁴ - t -1 is negative on [0,1], so the only solution is t=0.Therefore, equality occurs when x=y=z=0.So, putting it all together, since each term is at least 1, the sum is at least 3, with equality when x=y=z=0.**Final Answer**The inequality holds with equality when ( x = y = z = 0 ), so the final answer is boxed{3}."},{"question":"A square floor is fully covered with square tiles of the same size. Black tiles are placed along the two diagonals, and white tiles are used to cover the other areas. If there are a total of 101 black tiles, then the total number of tiles used to cover the entire floor isA. 625B. 676C. 2500D. 2601","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a square floor that's completely covered with square tiles, all the same size. The black tiles are placed along the two diagonals, and the rest are white. They told me there are a total of 101 black tiles, and I need to find the total number of tiles used to cover the entire floor. The options are A. 625, B. 676, C. 2500, D. 2601.Hmm, let me think. Since it's a square floor, the number of tiles must be a perfect square. The options given are all perfect squares, so that's good. The key here is that the black tiles are along the two diagonals. I remember that in a square grid, the main diagonals each have a number of tiles equal to the length of the side. But wait, if the square has an odd length, the two diagonals intersect at the center tile, so that tile is counted twice if I just add the two diagonals. But if the square has an even length, the two diagonals don't intersect, so each diagonal is just the length of the side.So, let me denote the side length of the square as 'n'. Then, the total number of tiles is n squared, which is n². Now, the number of black tiles is the number of tiles along both diagonals. If n is odd, the two diagonals intersect at one tile, so the total number of black tiles is 2n - 1. If n is even, the two diagonals don't intersect, so the total number of black tiles is 2n.They told me the total number of black tiles is 101. So, I can set up an equation here. If n is odd, then 2n - 1 = 101. If n is even, then 2n = 101. But 101 is an odd number, so 2n can't be 101 because 2n is always even. Therefore, n must be odd, and the equation is 2n - 1 = 101.Let me solve that equation. 2n - 1 = 101. Adding 1 to both sides, 2n = 102. Then, dividing both sides by 2, n = 51. So, the side length is 51 tiles. Therefore, the total number of tiles is 51 squared, which is 51 × 51.Wait, let me compute that. 50 squared is 2500, right? So, 51 squared is 50 squared plus 2×50 + 1, which is 2500 + 100 + 1 = 2601. So, the total number of tiles is 2601. Looking at the options, D is 2601, so that should be the answer.But hold on, let me double-check. If n is 51, which is odd, then the number of black tiles is 2×51 - 1 = 102 - 1 = 101. That matches the given information. So, yes, n is 51, and the total number of tiles is 51² = 2601. So, the answer is D.Alternatively, just to make sure, let's see if any of the other options could work. Let's take option C, which is 2500. That's 50 squared. If n is 50, which is even, then the number of black tiles would be 2×50 = 100. But we have 101 black tiles, so that's not enough. So, 2500 is too small.Option B is 676, which is 26 squared. If n is 26, then the number of black tiles would be 2×26 = 52, which is way less than 101. So, that's not it.Option A is 625, which is 25 squared. Then, number of black tiles would be 2×25 - 1 = 49, which is still less than 101. So, no.Therefore, the only possible answer is D, 2601.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Let (a, b, c) be positive integers such that (ab + bc - ca = 0) and (a - c = 101). Find (b).","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: Let (a, b, c) be positive integers such that (ab + bc - ca = 0) and (a - c = 101). I need to find (b). Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the given equations:1. (ab + bc - ca = 0)2. (a - c = 101)I need to find (b). Since (a, b, c) are positive integers, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others and substitute.Looking at the second equation, (a - c = 101), so I can express (a) as (c + 101). That might be helpful. Let me substitute (a = c + 101) into the first equation.So, replacing (a) in the first equation:( (c + 101)b + bc - (c + 101)c = 0 )Let me expand this:First term: ( (c + 101)b = cb + 101b )Second term: ( bc ) is just ( bc )Third term: ( -(c + 101)c = -c^2 - 101c )So putting it all together:( cb + 101b + bc - c^2 - 101c = 0 )Wait, let me combine like terms. I see (cb) and (bc), which are the same, so that's (2cb). Then (101b - 101c), and then (-c^2).So:( 2cb + 101b - 101c - c^2 = 0 )Hmm, maybe I can factor some terms here. Let me see.Looking at (2cb + 101b), I can factor out a (b):( b(2c + 101) )And then the other terms: ( -101c - c^2 ). Hmm, maybe factor out a (-c):( -c(101 + c) )So putting it together:( b(2c + 101) - c(101 + c) = 0 )Hmm, interesting. Let me write that as:( b(2c + 101) = c(101 + c) )So, solving for (b):( b = frac{c(101 + c)}{2c + 101} )Okay, so (b) is equal to that fraction. Since (b) is a positive integer, the denominator must divide the numerator. So, (2c + 101) must divide (c(101 + c)). Let me write that as:( 2c + 101 ) divides ( c(c + 101) )Hmm, so (2c + 101) divides (c(c + 101)). Maybe I can write this as a division problem or find some relationship.Alternatively, maybe I can express (c(c + 101)) in terms of (2c + 101). Let me try polynomial division or see if I can factor it.Let me denote (d = 2c + 101). Then, perhaps express (c) in terms of (d):( d = 2c + 101 Rightarrow c = frac{d - 101}{2} )But since (c) must be an integer, (d - 101) must be even, so (d) must be odd. That's something to note.Now, let's express (c(c + 101)) in terms of (d):First, (c = frac{d - 101}{2}), so (c + 101 = frac{d - 101}{2} + 101 = frac{d - 101 + 202}{2} = frac{d + 101}{2})Therefore, (c(c + 101) = frac{d - 101}{2} times frac{d + 101}{2} = frac{(d - 101)(d + 101)}{4} = frac{d^2 - (101)^2}{4})So, (c(c + 101) = frac{d^2 - 10201}{4})But we also have that (d) divides (c(c + 101)), so:( d ) divides ( frac{d^2 - 10201}{4} )Which implies that ( frac{d^2 - 10201}{4} ) is a multiple of (d), so:( frac{d^2 - 10201}{4} = k times d ) for some integer (k)Multiplying both sides by 4:( d^2 - 10201 = 4kd )Rearranging:( d^2 - 4kd - 10201 = 0 )This is a quadratic equation in terms of (d):( d^2 - 4kd - 10201 = 0 )Hmm, maybe I can solve for (d) in terms of (k). Using the quadratic formula:( d = frac{4k pm sqrt{(4k)^2 + 4 times 10201}}{2} )Simplify:( d = frac{4k pm sqrt{16k^2 + 40804}}{2} )Factor out 4 from the square root:( d = frac{4k pm 2sqrt{4k^2 + 10201}}{2} = 2k pm sqrt{4k^2 + 10201} )Since (d) is positive (because (c) is positive, so (d = 2c + 101 > 0)), we can ignore the negative root:( d = 2k + sqrt{4k^2 + 10201} )Hmm, so ( sqrt{4k^2 + 10201} ) must be an integer because (d) is an integer. Let me denote (m = sqrt{4k^2 + 10201}), so (m) is an integer. Then:( m^2 = 4k^2 + 10201 )Which can be rewritten as:( m^2 - 4k^2 = 10201 )This is a difference of squares:( (m - 2k)(m + 2k) = 10201 )Now, 10201 is a specific number. Let me factorize 10201 to find possible pairs of factors.Calculating, 10201 divided by 101 is 101, because 101*101=10201. So, 10201 is 101 squared.Therefore, the factors of 10201 are 1, 101, and 10201.So, the possible pairs of positive integers ((m - 2k, m + 2k)) are:1. (1, 10201)2. (101, 101)Because 10201 is a square, these are the only pairs where both factors are positive integers.Let me consider each case:Case 1: (m - 2k = 1) and (m + 2k = 10201)Adding these two equations:(2m = 10202 Rightarrow m = 5101)Subtracting the first equation from the second:(4k = 10200 Rightarrow k = 2550)Case 2: (m - 2k = 101) and (m + 2k = 101)Adding these two equations:(2m = 202 Rightarrow m = 101)Subtracting the first equation from the second:(4k = 0 Rightarrow k = 0)But (k = 0) would imply (d = 2k + m = 0 + 101 = 101), but let's check if that works.Wait, if (k = 0), then from earlier, (d = 2k + m = 0 + 101 = 101). Then, (c = frac{d - 101}{2} = frac{101 - 101}{2} = 0). But (c) must be a positive integer, so this case is invalid. So, only Case 1 is valid.So, from Case 1, (k = 2550) and (m = 5101). Therefore, (d = 2k + m = 2*2550 + 5101 = 5100 + 5101 = 10201). Wait, that seems a bit large, but let's check.Wait, actually, no. Wait, earlier, we had (d = 2k + sqrt{4k^2 + 10201}). But in Case 1, (m = 5101), so (d = 2k + m = 2*2550 + 5101 = 5100 + 5101 = 10201). So, (d = 10201).But (d = 2c + 101), so:(10201 = 2c + 101 Rightarrow 2c = 10201 - 101 = 10100 Rightarrow c = 5050)So, (c = 5050). Then, from (a = c + 101), (a = 5050 + 101 = 5151).Now, we can find (b) using the expression we had earlier:( b = frac{c(101 + c)}{2c + 101} )Plugging in (c = 5050):( b = frac{5050*(101 + 5050)}{2*5050 + 101} )Calculate numerator and denominator:Numerator: (5050 * 5151)Denominator: (10100 + 101 = 10201)So, (b = frac{5050 * 5151}{10201})Hmm, let's compute this. Notice that 10201 is 101^2, and 5050 is 50*101, and 5151 is 51*101.Wait, let's see:5050 = 50 * 1015151 = 51 * 101So, numerator: 50*101 * 51*101 = 50*51*(101)^2Denominator: (101)^2So, (b = frac{50*51*(101)^2}{(101)^2} = 50*51 = 2550)So, (b = 2550)Wait, let me double-check that:5050 * 5151 = (50*101)*(51*101) = 50*51*(101)^2Divided by 10201, which is (101)^2, so indeed, 50*51 = 2550.Yes, that seems correct.So, (b = 2550). Let me just verify with the original equation to make sure.Given (a = 5151), (b = 2550), (c = 5050).Check (ab + bc - ca = 0):Compute (ab = 5151 * 2550)Compute (bc = 2550 * 5050)Compute (ca = 5050 * 5151)So, (ab + bc - ca = 5151*2550 + 2550*5050 - 5050*5151)Factor out 2550 from the first two terms:2550*(5151 + 5050) - 5050*5151Compute 5151 + 5050 = 10201So, 2550*10201 - 5050*5151Now, note that 5050 = 2550 + 2500? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, note that 5050 = 50*101 and 5151 = 51*101, so 5050*5151 = 50*51*(101)^2.Similarly, 2550*10201 = 2550*(101)^2, since 10201 = 101^2.So, 2550*(101)^2 - 50*51*(101)^2Factor out (101)^2:(2550 - 50*51)*(101)^2Compute 50*51 = 2550So, 2550 - 2550 = 0Therefore, (ab + bc - ca = 0), which satisfies the equation.Also, (a - c = 5151 - 5050 = 101), which also satisfies the second equation.So, everything checks out. Therefore, (b = 2550).**Final Answer**The value of (b) is boxed{2550}."},{"question":"Suppose that f(x) = ax+b and g(x) = -3x+5. If h(x) = f(g(x)) and h^{-1}(x) = x+7, find a-b.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find ( a - b ) given some functions and their compositions. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, let me write down what I know:- ( f(x) = ax + b )- ( g(x) = -3x + 5 )- ( h(x) = f(g(x)) )- ( h^{-1}(x) = x + 7 )I need to find ( a - b ). Hmm, okay. So, ( h(x) ) is the composition of ( f ) and ( g ), which means I plug ( g(x) ) into ( f(x) ). Let me do that first.So, ( h(x) = f(g(x)) = a cdot g(x) + b ). Since ( g(x) = -3x + 5 ), substituting that in, I get:( h(x) = a(-3x + 5) + b )Let me distribute the ( a ):( h(x) = -3a x + 5a + b )Okay, so ( h(x) ) is a linear function of the form ( h(x) = mx + c ), where ( m = -3a ) and ( c = 5a + b ).Now, I also know that the inverse function of ( h(x) ) is given as ( h^{-1}(x) = x + 7 ). I remember that for linear functions, the inverse can be found by swapping ( x ) and ( y ) and solving for ( y ). Let me recall that process.If ( h(x) = mx + c ), then to find its inverse:1. Start with ( y = mx + c )2. Swap ( x ) and ( y ): ( x = m y + c )3. Solve for ( y ): ( y = frac{x - c}{m} )So, the inverse function ( h^{-1}(x) ) is ( frac{x - c}{m} ).But in the problem, it's given that ( h^{-1}(x) = x + 7 ). That means:( frac{x - c}{m} = x + 7 )Let me write that equation:( frac{x - c}{m} = x + 7 )Hmm, so I can set up this equation and solve for ( m ) and ( c ). Let me do that.Multiply both sides by ( m ):( x - c = m(x + 7) )Expanding the right side:( x - c = m x + 7m )Now, let's bring all terms to one side:( x - c - m x - 7m = 0 )Factor out ( x ):( (1 - m)x - (c + 7m) = 0 )Since this equation must hold for all ( x ), the coefficients of ( x ) and the constant term must both be zero. Therefore, we have two equations:1. ( 1 - m = 0 ) (coefficient of ( x ))2. ( - (c + 7m) = 0 ) (constant term)Let me solve these equations one by one.From equation 1:( 1 - m = 0 ) implies ( m = 1 ).From equation 2:( - (c + 7m) = 0 ) implies ( c + 7m = 0 ).But we already found ( m = 1 ), so substitute that into equation 2:( c + 7(1) = 0 ) => ( c + 7 = 0 ) => ( c = -7 ).So, we have ( m = 1 ) and ( c = -7 ).But wait, earlier we had expressions for ( m ) and ( c ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ):- ( m = -3a )- ( c = 5a + b )So, let's set those equal to the values we just found.First, ( m = 1 ):( -3a = 1 ) => ( a = -frac{1}{3} )Second, ( c = -7 ):( 5a + b = -7 )We already found ( a = -frac{1}{3} ), so let's substitute that in:( 5(-frac{1}{3}) + b = -7 )Calculate ( 5 times -frac{1}{3} ):( -frac{5}{3} + b = -7 )Now, solve for ( b ):Add ( frac{5}{3} ) to both sides:( b = -7 + frac{5}{3} )Convert -7 to thirds to add:( -7 = -frac{21}{3} ), so:( b = -frac{21}{3} + frac{5}{3} = -frac{16}{3} )So, ( a = -frac{1}{3} ) and ( b = -frac{16}{3} ).Therefore, ( a - b = -frac{1}{3} - (-frac{16}{3}) = -frac{1}{3} + frac{16}{3} = frac{15}{3} = 5 ).Wait, let me double-check that calculation for ( a - b ):( a = -frac{1}{3} )( b = -frac{16}{3} )So, ( a - b = (-frac{1}{3}) - (-frac{16}{3}) = (-frac{1}{3}) + frac{16}{3} = frac{15}{3} = 5 ). Yeah, that seems right.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:1. ( h(x) = f(g(x)) = a(-3x + 5) + b = -3a x + 5a + b )2. The inverse of ( h(x) ) is given as ( x + 7 ), so ( h^{-1}(x) = x + 7 )3. For linear functions, the inverse is ( frac{x - c}{m} ), so setting that equal to ( x + 7 ) gives us equations to solve for ( m ) and ( c )4. Solving those, we found ( m = 1 ) and ( c = -7 )5. Then, using ( m = -3a ) and ( c = 5a + b ), we solved for ( a ) and ( b )6. Finally, calculated ( a - b = 5 )I think that all checks out. Let me just verify by plugging back into the original functions.Given ( a = -frac{1}{3} ) and ( b = -frac{16}{3} ), let's compute ( h(x) ):( h(x) = f(g(x)) = f(-3x + 5) = a(-3x + 5) + b = (-frac{1}{3})(-3x + 5) + (-frac{16}{3}) )Simplify:( (-frac{1}{3})(-3x) = x )( (-frac{1}{3})(5) = -frac{5}{3} )So, ( h(x) = x - frac{5}{3} - frac{16}{3} = x - frac{21}{3} = x - 7 )Therefore, ( h(x) = x - 7 ). Now, let's find its inverse.To find ( h^{-1}(x) ), we can write ( y = x - 7 ), then swap ( x ) and ( y ):( x = y - 7 )Solving for ( y ):( y = x + 7 )Which is exactly what was given: ( h^{-1}(x) = x + 7 ). So that checks out.Therefore, my calculations seem correct, and ( a - b = 5 ).**Final Answer**boxed{5}"},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=2sin xcos x-sqrt{3}cos 2x+1 (xin mathbb{R}).(1) Simplify f(x) and find the smallest positive period of f(x);(2) Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval xin left[ frac{pi}{4},frac{pi}{2} right].","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = 2 sin x cos x - sqrt(3) cos 2x + 1, and I need to simplify it and find its smallest positive period. Then, I also need to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [π/4, π/2]. Hmm, let's start with part (1).First, looking at the function, I see terms like 2 sin x cos x and cos 2x. I remember some trigonometric identities that might help simplify this. Specifically, 2 sin x cos x is equal to sin 2x. Let me write that down:2 sin x cos x = sin 2x.So, substituting that into the function, f(x) becomes:f(x) = sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x + 1.Alright, that's a bit simpler. Now, looking at the first two terms, sin 2x and cos 2x, they both have the same argument, 2x. Maybe I can combine them into a single sine or cosine function using the amplitude-phase form. The general identity is A sin θ + B cos θ = C sin(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and tan φ = B/A or something like that. Let me recall the exact formula.Yes, the identity is A sin θ + B cos θ = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) sin(θ + φ), where φ = arctan(B/A) if A ≠ 0. Alternatively, it can also be written as sqrt(A^2 + B^2) cos(θ - φ'), depending on how you set it up. Let me figure out which one is more suitable here.In our case, we have sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x. So, A is 1 (coefficient of sin 2x) and B is -sqrt(3) (coefficient of cos 2x). So, let's compute the amplitude:C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) = sqrt(1^2 + (-sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(1 + 3) = sqrt(4) = 2.Okay, so the amplitude is 2. Now, let's find the phase shift φ. Since we have A sin θ + B cos θ, the formula is:sin θ + B cos θ = C sin(θ + φ), where φ = arctan(B/A). Wait, actually, let me double-check. The formula is:A sin θ + B cos θ = C sin(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and φ = arctan(B/A). But wait, actually, it's a bit different. Let me recall:If we have A sin θ + B cos θ, then it can be written as C sin(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and φ = arctan(B/A). But actually, I think it's φ = arctan(B/A) when expressed as a sine function, but sometimes it's better to use cosine. Maybe I should use the cosine form instead.Alternatively, another approach is to write it as C cos(θ - φ). Let me try that.So, A sin θ + B cos θ = C cos(θ - φ), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and φ = arctan(A/B). Let me verify that.Yes, because cos(θ - φ) = cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ. So, if we have A sin θ + B cos θ, it's equivalent to B cos θ + A sin θ, which would be C cos(θ - φ) where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and φ = arctan(A/B). So, in this case, A is 1 and B is -sqrt(3). So, φ = arctan(A/B) = arctan(1/(-sqrt(3))) = arctan(-1/sqrt(3)).Hmm, arctan(-1/sqrt(3)) is equal to -π/6, since tan(π/6) = 1/sqrt(3). So, φ = -π/6.Therefore, sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x = 2 cos(2x - (-π/6)) = 2 cos(2x + π/6). Wait, let me make sure.Wait, if we use the identity A sin θ + B cos θ = C cos(θ - φ), then:A sin θ + B cos θ = C cos(θ - φ) = C cos θ cos φ + C sin θ sin φ.Comparing coefficients:B = C cos φA = C sin φSo, tan φ = A/B.Wait, so in our case, A = 1, B = -sqrt(3). So, tan φ = A/B = 1/(-sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3). So, φ is in the fourth quadrant, which is -π/6 or 11π/6. So, φ = -π/6.Therefore, sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x = 2 cos(2x - (-π/6)) = 2 cos(2x + π/6). Wait, is that correct?Wait, let me test it. Let me compute 2 cos(2x + π/6):2 cos(2x + π/6) = 2 [cos 2x cos π/6 - sin 2x sin π/6] = 2 [cos 2x (sqrt(3)/2) - sin 2x (1/2)] = sqrt(3) cos 2x - sin 2x.But in our case, we have sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x, which is the negative of that. So, sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x = - [sqrt(3) cos 2x - sin 2x] = -2 cos(2x + π/6).Wait, so that would mean sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x = -2 cos(2x + π/6). Hmm, let me check:Compute -2 cos(2x + π/6) = -2 [cos 2x cos π/6 - sin 2x sin π/6] = -2 [ (sqrt(3)/2 cos 2x - 1/2 sin 2x) ] = -sqrt(3) cos 2x + sin 2x, which is exactly our expression. So, yes, sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x = -2 cos(2x + π/6).Alternatively, we can write it as 2 sin(2x - π/3). Let me see:2 sin(2x - π/3) = 2 [sin 2x cos π/3 - cos 2x sin π/3] = 2 [sin 2x (1/2) - cos 2x (sqrt(3)/2)] = sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x.Yes, that works too. So, sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x can be written as 2 sin(2x - π/3). So, that might be a cleaner expression.So, f(x) = sin 2x - sqrt(3) cos 2x + 1 = 2 sin(2x - π/3) + 1.Alternatively, it can also be written as -2 cos(2x + π/6) + 1, but I think the sine form is more straightforward here.So, f(x) simplifies to 2 sin(2x - π/3) + 1.Now, to find the smallest positive period of f(x). Since f(x) is expressed in terms of sin(2x - π/3), which is a sine function with argument 2x - π/3. The general period of sin(kx + c) is 2π / |k|. In this case, k is 2, so the period is 2π / 2 = π. So, the period of sin(2x - π/3) is π. Since f(x) is just a vertical shift and scaling of this sine function, the period remains the same. So, the smallest positive period of f(x) is π.Alright, so part (1) is done: f(x) simplifies to 2 sin(2x - π/3) + 1, and its smallest positive period is π.Moving on to part (2): Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval x ∈ [π/4, π/2].So, f(x) = 2 sin(2x - π/3) + 1. To find the maximum and minimum on [π/4, π/2], we can analyze the function within this interval.First, let's consider the substitution θ = 2x - π/3. Then, when x = π/4, θ = 2*(π/4) - π/3 = π/2 - π/3 = (3π/6 - 2π/6) = π/6. When x = π/2, θ = 2*(π/2) - π/3 = π - π/3 = 2π/3.So, θ ranges from π/6 to 2π/3 as x goes from π/4 to π/2. Therefore, we need to find the maximum and minimum of 2 sin θ + 1 where θ ∈ [π/6, 2π/3].So, let's analyze the function g(θ) = 2 sin θ + 1 over θ ∈ [π/6, 2π/3].The sine function sin θ increases from θ = π/6 to θ = π/2, reaching its maximum at θ = π/2, and then decreases from θ = π/2 to θ = 2π/3.Therefore, the maximum of sin θ in [π/6, 2π/3] is at θ = π/2, and the minimum is at the endpoints, θ = π/6 and θ = 2π/3. Let's compute sin θ at these points:- sin(π/6) = 1/2- sin(π/2) = 1- sin(2π/3) = sin(π - π/3) = sin(π/3) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866So, sin θ reaches its maximum at θ = π/2, which is 1, and its minimum at θ = π/6, which is 1/2, since sin(2π/3) is larger than sin(π/6). Wait, actually, sin(2π/3) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which is larger than sin(π/6) = 0.5. So, the minimum is at θ = π/6, and the maximum is at θ = π/2.Therefore, the maximum value of g(θ) = 2 sin θ + 1 is 2*1 + 1 = 3, and the minimum value is 2*(1/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.Wait, hold on, let me verify:At θ = π/6: g(θ) = 2*(1/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.At θ = π/2: g(θ) = 2*1 + 1 = 3.At θ = 2π/3: g(θ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) + 1 = sqrt(3) + 1 ≈ 1.732 + 1 = 2.732.So, indeed, the maximum is 3 at θ = π/2, and the minimum is 2 at θ = π/6.Therefore, translating back to x:θ = π/6 corresponds to x = (θ + π/3)/2 = (π/6 + π/3)/2 = (π/6 + 2π/6)/2 = (3π/6)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4. So, x = π/4.Similarly, θ = π/2 corresponds to x = (θ + π/3)/2 = (π/2 + π/3)/2 = (3π/6 + 2π/6)/2 = (5π/6)/2 = 5π/12.Wait, hold on, let me make sure. θ = 2x - π/3, so x = (θ + π/3)/2.So, when θ = π/6, x = (π/6 + π/3)/2 = (π/6 + 2π/6)/2 = (3π/6)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4. Correct.When θ = π/2, x = (π/2 + π/3)/2 = (3π/6 + 2π/6)/2 = (5π/6)/2 = 5π/12.Similarly, when θ = 2π/3, x = (2π/3 + π/3)/2 = (3π/3)/2 = π/2. Correct.So, the maximum of f(x) occurs at x = 5π/12, and the minimum occurs at x = π/4.Therefore, in the interval [π/4, π/2], f(x) attains its maximum value of 3 at x = 5π/12 and its minimum value of 2 at x = π/4.Wait, but let me double-check if there are any critical points within the interval that might yield higher or lower values. So, f(x) is differentiable everywhere, so its extrema can occur either at critical points or at the endpoints.We can compute the derivative of f(x) to find critical points.f(x) = 2 sin(2x - π/3) + 1.f'(x) = 2 * cos(2x - π/3) * 2 = 4 cos(2x - π/3).Set f'(x) = 0:4 cos(2x - π/3) = 0 => cos(2x - π/3) = 0.Solutions are 2x - π/3 = π/2 + kπ, k ∈ ℤ.So, 2x = π/2 + π/3 + kπ = (3π/6 + 2π/6) + kπ = 5π/6 + kπ.Thus, x = 5π/12 + kπ/2.Now, let's find x in [π/4, π/2].Compute 5π/12 ≈ 1.308, π/4 ≈ 0.785, π/2 ≈ 1.571.So, 5π/12 ≈ 1.308 is within [π/4, π/2]. The next solution would be 5π/12 + π/2 = 5π/12 + 6π/12 = 11π/12 ≈ 2.879, which is outside the interval. Similarly, subtracting π/2 gives 5π/12 - 6π/12 = -π/12, which is also outside. So, the only critical point in [π/4, π/2] is x = 5π/12.Therefore, the extrema occur either at x = π/4, x = 5π/12, or x = π/2.We already evaluated f(x) at these points:At x = π/4: f(π/4) = 2 sin(2*(π/4) - π/3) + 1 = 2 sin(π/2 - π/3) + 1 = 2 sin(π/6) + 1 = 2*(1/2) + 1 = 2.At x = 5π/12: f(5π/12) = 2 sin(2*(5π/12) - π/3) + 1 = 2 sin(5π/6 - π/3) + 1 = 2 sin(5π/6 - 2π/6) = 2 sin(3π/6) = 2 sin(π/2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3.At x = π/2: f(π/2) = 2 sin(2*(π/2) - π/3) + 1 = 2 sin(π - π/3) + 1 = 2 sin(2π/3) + 1 = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) + 1 = sqrt(3) + 1 ≈ 2.732.So, indeed, the maximum is 3 at x = 5π/12, and the minimum is 2 at x = π/4.Therefore, the maximum value is 3, and the minimum value is 2 on the interval [π/4, π/2].Wait, just to be thorough, let me check if the function is indeed increasing from π/4 to 5π/12 and then decreasing from 5π/12 to π/2.Given that f'(x) = 4 cos(2x - π/3). Let's evaluate the sign of f'(x) around x = 5π/12.For x slightly less than 5π/12, say x = 5π/12 - ε, then 2x - π/3 = 2*(5π/12 - ε) - π/3 = 5π/6 - 2ε - π/3 = 5π/6 - 2π/6 - 2ε = π/2 - 2ε. So, cos(π/2 - 2ε) = sin(2ε) > 0. Therefore, f'(x) > 0 before x = 5π/12.For x slightly more than 5π/12, say x = 5π/12 + ε, then 2x - π/3 = 5π/6 + 2ε - π/3 = 5π/6 - 2π/6 + 2ε = π/2 + 2ε. So, cos(π/2 + 2ε) = -sin(2ε) < 0. Therefore, f'(x) < 0 after x = 5π/12.Thus, the function increases up to x = 5π/12 and then decreases, confirming that x = 5π/12 is indeed a maximum.Therefore, the maximum value is 3, and the minimum value is 2 on the given interval.**Final Answer**(1) The simplified function is boxed{2sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{3}right) + 1} and its smallest positive period is boxed{pi}.(2) The maximum value of f(x) on the interval is boxed{3} and the minimum value is boxed{2}."},{"question":"A book is published in three volumes, the pages being numbered from  1  onwards.

The number of pages in the second volume is  50  more than that in the first volume, and the number pages in the third volume is one and a half times that in the second. The sum of the page numbers on the first pages of the three volumes is  1709 . If  n  is the last page number, what is the largest prime factor of  n ?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about three volumes of a book, and I need to figure out the largest prime factor of the last page number, n. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem says that the pages are numbered continuously from the first volume to the second and then to the third. So, the first volume starts at page 1, the second volume starts right after the last page of the first, and the third does the same after the second.It mentions that the number of pages in the second volume is 50 more than the first. Let me denote the number of pages in the first volume as x. Then, the second volume would have x + 50 pages. The third volume has one and a half times the number of pages as the second volume. So, that would be 1.5 times (x + 50). Hmm, 1.5 is the same as 3/2, so maybe I can write that as (3/2)(x + 50). That might be easier to work with.Now, the sum of the page numbers on the first pages of the three volumes is 1709. Wait, the first pages of each volume. So, the first volume starts at page 1, right? So, the first page of the first volume is 1. The first page of the second volume would be the next page after the last page of the first volume. If the first volume has x pages, then the last page is x, so the first page of the second volume is x + 1. Similarly, the first page of the third volume would be the next page after the last page of the second volume. The second volume has x + 50 pages, so its last page is x + (x + 50) = 2x + 50. Therefore, the first page of the third volume is 2x + 51.So, the sum of the first pages is 1 (from the first volume) + (x + 1) (from the second volume) + (2x + 51) (from the third volume). Let me write that equation:1 + (x + 1) + (2x + 51) = 1709Let me simplify that:1 + x + 1 + 2x + 51 = 1709Combine like terms:(1 + 1 + 51) + (x + 2x) = 1709That's 53 + 3x = 1709Subtract 53 from both sides:3x = 1709 - 531709 - 53 is... let me calculate that. 1709 - 50 is 1659, then minus 3 more is 1656. So, 3x = 1656Divide both sides by 3:x = 1656 / 3Let me do that division. 3 goes into 16 five times (15), remainder 1. Bring down the 5: 15. 3 goes into 15 five times. Bring down the 6: 6. 3 goes into 6 twice. So, x = 552.Wait, so the first volume has 552 pages. Then, the second volume has x + 50, which is 552 + 50 = 602 pages. The third volume is 1.5 times the second, so that's 1.5 * 602. Let me calculate that. 602 * 1.5 is the same as 602 + 301, which is 903 pages. So, the third volume has 903 pages.Now, the last page number, n, is the sum of all pages in the three volumes. So, n = x + (x + 50) + (1.5)(x + 50). Let me plug in x = 552.First, x = 552, so x + 50 = 602, and 1.5*(x + 50) = 903. So, n = 552 + 602 + 903.Let me add those up. 552 + 602 is 1154, and 1154 + 903 is... let's see, 1154 + 900 is 2054, plus 3 is 2057. So, n = 2057.Wait, but let me double-check that addition. 552 + 602: 500 + 600 is 1100, 52 + 2 is 54, so total 1154. Then 1154 + 903: 1154 + 900 is 2054, plus 3 is 2057. Yep, that seems right.Now, the problem asks for the largest prime factor of n, which is 2057. So, I need to factorize 2057 and find its prime factors, then identify the largest one.Let me try dividing 2057 by small primes. First, is it even? 2057 is odd, so not divisible by 2. Sum of digits: 2 + 0 + 5 + 7 = 14, which isn't divisible by 3, so 2057 isn't divisible by 3. Ends with a 7, so not divisible by 5.Let me try 7: 2057 divided by 7. 7 goes into 20 twice (14), remainder 6. Bring down 5: 65. 7 goes into 65 nine times (63), remainder 2. Bring down 7: 27. 7 goes into 27 three times (21), remainder 6. So, not divisible by 7.Next prime is 11. Let's test 11. The rule for 11 is alternating sum of digits: (2 + 5) - (0 + 7) = 7 - 7 = 0. Since 0 is divisible by 11, 2057 is divisible by 11.So, 2057 ÷ 11. Let me do that division. 11 into 20 is 1, remainder 9. Bring down 5: 95. 11 into 95 is 8 times (88), remainder 7. Bring down 7: 77. 11 into 77 is 7. So, 2057 ÷ 11 = 187.So, 2057 = 11 × 187.Now, let's factor 187. 187: Let's see, 11 × 17 is 187, right? Because 11 × 17 is 187. Let me check: 11 × 17: 10×17=170, plus 1×17=17, so 170+17=187. Yes, correct.So, 187 = 11 × 17. Therefore, 2057 = 11 × 11 × 17.Wait, so the prime factors are 11, 11, and 17. So, the prime factors are 11 and 17. The largest one is 17.Wait, hold on, is 17 a prime? Yes, 17 is a prime number. So, the prime factors are 11 and 17, with 17 being the largest.Therefore, the largest prime factor of n is 17.But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in division or multiplication.So, 2057 divided by 11 is 187, correct. Then 187 divided by 11 is 17, which is prime. So, yes, 2057 factors into 11² × 17. So, the prime factors are 11 and 17, with 17 being the largest.So, the answer should be 17.**Final Answer**The largest prime factor of ( n ) is boxed{17}."},{"question":"Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams. Together, they have 150. How much money, in dollars, does Jackson have?","answer":"First, I'll define the variables. Let ( W ) represent the amount of money Williams has. Since Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, Jackson's amount can be expressed as ( 5W ).Next, I'll set up the equation based on the total amount of money they have together. The sum of Williams' and Jackson's money is 150, so the equation is:[ W + 5W = 150 ]Combining like terms, this simplifies to:[ 6W = 150 ]To find the value of ( W ), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 6:[ W = frac{150}{6} = 25 ]Now that I know Williams has 25, I can determine Jackson's amount by multiplying Williams' money by 5:[ 5W = 5 times 25 = 125 ]Therefore, Jackson has 125."},{"question":"Compute the limit of the function:[lim _{x rightarrow 0} frac{e^{x}-e^{-2 x}}{x+sin x^{2}}]","answer":"Alright, so I need to compute the limit as x approaches 0 of the function (e^x - e^{-2x}) divided by (x + sin(x²)). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, when I see a limit as x approaches 0, I remember that sometimes plugging in x = 0 directly can give me an answer, but in this case, if I plug in x = 0, the numerator becomes e^0 - e^{0} which is 1 - 1 = 0, and the denominator becomes 0 + sin(0) which is also 0. So, we have a 0/0 indeterminate form. That means I can probably use L'Hôpital's Rule here. Wait, just to make sure, L'Hôpital's Rule applies when the limit is in the form 0/0 or ∞/∞, right? So, since both numerator and denominator approach 0 as x approaches 0, it's definitely applicable here. So, I should take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator and then take the limit again.Let me compute the derivative of the numerator first. The numerator is e^x - e^{-2x}. The derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of e^{-2x} is -2e^{-2x} because of the chain rule. So, putting it together, the derivative of the numerator is e^x - (-2e^{-2x}) which simplifies to e^x + 2e^{-2x}.Now, the denominator is x + sin(x²). Let's find its derivative. The derivative of x is 1, and the derivative of sin(x²) is 2x cos(x²) by the chain rule. So, the derivative of the denominator is 1 + 2x cos(x²).So, applying L'Hôpital's Rule, the limit becomes the limit as x approaches 0 of (e^x + 2e^{-2x}) divided by (1 + 2x cos(x²)). Now, let's evaluate this new limit. When x approaches 0, e^x approaches e^0 which is 1, and e^{-2x} approaches e^0 which is also 1. So, the numerator becomes 1 + 2*1 = 3. For the denominator, as x approaches 0, 2x approaches 0, and cos(x²) approaches cos(0) which is 1. So, the denominator becomes 1 + 0*1 = 1. Therefore, the limit simplifies to 3/1, which is 3. Wait, hold on. That seems straightforward, but let me double-check in case I made a mistake in differentiation or simplification.Starting again, the original function is (e^x - e^{-2x}) / (x + sin(x²)). At x=0, it's 0/0, so L'Hôpital's Rule applies. Derivative of numerator: d/dx [e^x - e^{-2x}] = e^x + 2e^{-2x}. Correct.Derivative of denominator: d/dx [x + sin(x²)] = 1 + 2x cos(x²). Correct.So, plugging in x=0 into the derivatives: numerator is e^0 + 2e^{0} = 1 + 2 = 3. Denominator is 1 + 2*0*cos(0) = 1 + 0 = 1. So, 3/1 = 3. Hmm, that seems consistent. Maybe I can also try another method, like expanding the numerator and denominator into their Taylor series around x=0, to see if I get the same result.Let's recall the Taylor series expansions:For e^x, the expansion around 0 is 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ...For e^{-2x}, the expansion is 1 - 2x + (4x²)/2! - (8x³)/3! + ...So, subtracting these, e^x - e^{-2x} would be:(1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + ...) - (1 - 2x + 2x² - (4x³)/3 + ...) Let's compute term by term:1 - 1 = 0x - (-2x) = x + 2x = 3xx²/2 - 2x² = (1/2 - 2)x² = (-3/2)x²x³/6 - (-4x³/3) = x³/6 + 4x³/3 = (1/6 + 8/6)x³ = (9/6)x³ = (3/2)x³And so on. So, up to the x³ term, the numerator is 3x - (3/2)x² + (3/2)x³ + ...Now, the denominator is x + sin(x²). Let's expand sin(x²) as well. The Taylor series for sin(z) around z=0 is z - z³/6 + z^5/120 - ..., so substituting z = x², we get:sin(x²) = x² - (x^6)/6 + (x^{10})/120 - ...So, the denominator becomes x + x² - (x^6)/6 + ... So, putting it all together, the numerator is approximately 3x - (3/2)x² + (3/2)x³ and the denominator is approximately x + x².So, let's factor out x from both numerator and denominator:Numerator: x*(3 - (3/2)x + (3/2)x²)Denominator: x*(1 + x)So, the x cancels out, and we have (3 - (3/2)x + (3/2)x²) / (1 + x). Now, as x approaches 0, the terms with x in them become negligible, so the limit is 3 / 1 = 3.So, that confirms the result we got earlier using L'Hôpital's Rule. Alternatively, another way to think about it is to use the standard limits:lim_{x->0} (e^{kx} - 1)/x = kandlim_{x->0} sin(mx)/x = mBut in this case, since the numerator is e^x - e^{-2x}, which can be rewritten as (e^x - 1) - (e^{-2x} - 1). So, maybe I can split the numerator into two parts:(e^x - 1) - (e^{-2x} - 1)Similarly, the denominator is x + sin(x²). So, let's write the function as:[(e^x - 1) - (e^{-2x} - 1)] / (x + sin(x²))Now, let's consider splitting the fraction into two parts:[(e^x - 1)/ (x + sin(x²))] - [(e^{-2x} - 1)/(x + sin(x²))]Now, let's analyze each part separately.First, for the term (e^x - 1)/(x + sin(x²)). As x approaches 0, e^x - 1 is approximately x, and sin(x²) is approximately x². So, the denominator is approximately x + x², which is approximately x(1 + x). So, the term becomes approximately x / (x(1 + x)) = 1/(1 + x). As x approaches 0, this approaches 1.Similarly, for the term (e^{-2x} - 1)/(x + sin(x²)). As x approaches 0, e^{-2x} - 1 is approximately -2x, and the denominator is approximately x + x², so approximately x(1 + x). So, the term becomes approximately (-2x)/(x(1 + x)) = -2/(1 + x). As x approaches 0, this approaches -2.Therefore, putting it together, the limit is 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3.Wait, hold on, that seems a bit confusing. Let me clarify.Wait, actually, when I split the fraction, it's [(e^x - 1) - (e^{-2x} - 1)] / (x + sin(x²)) = [ (e^x - 1)/(x + sin(x²)) ] - [ (e^{-2x} - 1)/(x + sin(x²)) ]So, each term is (e^{kx} - 1)/(x + sin(x²)). For the first term, k = 1, for the second term, k = -2.So, let's compute each limit separately:lim_{x->0} (e^{kx} - 1)/(x + sin(x²)) Let me compute this limit for general k.As x approaches 0, e^{kx} - 1 ~ kx, and sin(x²) ~ x². So, the denominator is approximately x + x² = x(1 + x). Therefore, the expression becomes approximately (kx)/(x(1 + x)) = k/(1 + x). As x approaches 0, this approaches k.Therefore, for the first term, k = 1, so the limit is 1. For the second term, k = -2, so the limit is -2. Therefore, the overall limit is 1 - (-2) = 3.That's another way to see it, and it also gives the same result.Alternatively, I could have considered using the standard limits:lim_{x->0} (e^{ax} - 1)/x = aandlim_{x->0} sin(bx)/x = bBut in our case, the denominator is x + sin(x²), which is a bit more complicated because it's x + sin(x²). So, perhaps it's better to factor out x from the denominator or use the expansion as I did earlier.Wait, let's try another approach. Let me write the original limit as:lim_{x->0} [ (e^x - e^{-2x}) / (x + sin(x²)) ]Let me factor out x from numerator and denominator.Wait, but the numerator is e^x - e^{-2x}, which is not directly factorable by x, but maybe we can express it as a sum of terms involving x.Alternatively, I can write the numerator as:e^x - e^{-2x} = (e^x - 1) - (e^{-2x} - 1)As I did earlier. Then, the denominator is x + sin(x²). So, then, perhaps I can write the entire expression as:[ (e^x - 1) - (e^{-2x} - 1) ] / (x + sin(x²)) = [ (e^x - 1)/(x + sin(x²)) ] - [ (e^{-2x} - 1)/(x + sin(x²)) ]Then, as x approaches 0, each fraction can be approximated.As x approaches 0, e^x - 1 ~ x, and e^{-2x} - 1 ~ -2x. So, the numerator becomes approximately x - (-2x) = 3x.The denominator is x + sin(x²) ~ x + x². So, approximately x(1 + x). So, the entire expression is approximately (3x)/(x(1 + x)) = 3/(1 + x). As x approaches 0, this tends to 3.So, that's another way to see it.Alternatively, maybe I can use the expansion of the numerator and denominator up to certain orders and then divide them.Let me try that.As I did earlier, the numerator e^x - e^{-2x} expands to 3x - (3/2)x² + (3/2)x³ + ...Denominator x + sin(x²) expands to x + x² - (x^6)/6 + ... So, if I write the numerator as 3x - (3/2)x² + (3/2)x³ and the denominator as x + x², then I can factor x from both:Numerator: x*(3 - (3/2)x + (3/2)x²)Denominator: x*(1 + x)So, cancel x, and get (3 - (3/2)x + (3/2)x²)/(1 + x). Then, as x approaches 0, the higher order terms vanish, so the limit is 3/1 = 3.So, that's consistent with all the other methods.Alternatively, maybe I can use the expansion of the entire function.Let me write the function as:(e^x - e^{-2x}) / (x + sin(x²)) = [ (1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + ...) - (1 - 2x + 2x² - (4x³)/3 + ...) ] / (x + x² - x^6/6 + ... )Simplify numerator:1 - 1 = 0x - (-2x) = 3xx²/2 - 2x² = (-3/2)x²x³/6 - (-4x³/3) = (x³/6 + 4x³/3) = (x³/6 + 8x³/6) = 9x³/6 = 3x³/2So, numerator is 3x - (3/2)x² + (3/2)x³ + ...Denominator is x + x² - x^6/6 + ... So, numerator: 3x - (3/2)x² + (3/2)x³Denominator: x(1 + x - x^5/6 + ... )So, factor x from numerator and denominator:Numerator: x*(3 - (3/2)x + (3/2)x²)Denominator: x*(1 + x - x^5/6 + ... )Cancel x:(3 - (3/2)x + (3/2)x²) / (1 + x - x^5/6 + ... )Now, as x approaches 0, the higher order terms become negligible, so the limit is 3 / 1 = 3.Same result again.Alternatively, maybe I can use the substitution t = x, and as t approaches 0, but that doesn't really change anything.Wait, another thought: perhaps using the expansion of the denominator in the denominator, so to speak.We have denominator x + sin(x²). Let me write sin(x²) as x² - (x^6)/6 + ... So, denominator is x + x² - (x^6)/6 + ... So, approximately x + x².So, if I write denominator as x(1 + x - x^5/6 + ... )So, the function becomes [3x - (3/2)x² + (3/2)x³ + ... ] / [x(1 + x - x^5/6 + ... ) ]Cancel x:[3 - (3/2)x + (3/2)x² + ... ] / [1 + x - x^5/6 + ... ]Now, as x approaches 0, the higher order terms vanish, so we have 3 / 1 = 3.Alternatively, maybe I can use the expansion of 1/(1 + x - x^5/6 + ...) as 1 - x + x² + ... using the expansion 1/(1 + a) ≈ 1 - a + a² - ... for small a.So, let me try that.Let me denote the denominator as 1 + x - x^5/6 + ... Let me call this 1 + a, where a = x - x^5/6 + ...So, 1/(1 + a) ≈ 1 - a + a² - a³ + ... So, up to the first order, 1/(1 + a) ≈ 1 - a.So, substituting back, 1/(1 + x - x^5/6 + ...) ≈ 1 - (x - x^5/6 + ...) So, up to x terms, it's 1 - x.Therefore, the entire expression becomes:[3 - (3/2)x + (3/2)x²] * [1 - x + ... ] Multiplying out:3*(1) + 3*(-x) + (-3/2)x*(1) + higher order terms.So, 3 - 3x - (3/2)x + ... Wait, that would be 3 - (9/2)x + ... But as x approaches 0, the linear terms vanish, so the limit is 3.Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it with the series expansion. Since all methods point to the limit being 3, I think that's solid.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute the limit numerically for some small x values.Let me pick x = 0.001.Compute numerator: e^{0.001} - e^{-0.002} ≈ (1 + 0.001 + 0.0000005) - (1 - 0.002 + 0.000002) ≈ (1.0010005) - (0.998002) ≈ 0.0030005 - 0.0000015 ≈ 0.002999Denominator: 0.001 + sin(0.000001) ≈ 0.001 + 0.000001 ≈ 0.001001So, the ratio is approximately 0.002999 / 0.001001 ≈ 2.997, which is approximately 3.Similarly, for x = -0.001:Numerator: e^{-0.001} - e^{0.002} ≈ (1 - 0.001 + 0.0000005) - (1 + 0.002 + 0.000002) ≈ (0.9990005) - (1.002002) ≈ -0.0030015Denominator: -0.001 + sin(0.000001) ≈ -0.001 + 0.000001 ≈ -0.000999So, the ratio is (-0.0030015)/(-0.000999) ≈ 3.0045, which is approximately 3.So, numerically, it's also approaching 3 from both sides.Therefore, I can confidently say that the limit is 3.**Final Answer**The limit is boxed{3}."},{"question":"The base of an isosceles triangle is 8 cm, and the legs are 12 cm each. Find the length of the segment connecting the points where the angle bisectors of the angles at the base intersect the legs of the triangle.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about an isosceles triangle. The base is 8 cm, and each of the legs is 12 cm. I need to find the length of the segment that connects the points where the angle bisectors of the base angles intersect the legs. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, let me sketch the triangle in my mind. It's an isosceles triangle, so two sides are equal, which are the legs, each 12 cm, and the base is 8 cm. So, the triangle has a base of 8 cm, and the two equal sides are 12 cm each. Let me label the triangle as ABC, where AB and AC are the legs, each 12 cm, and BC is the base, 8 cm. So, vertex A is the apex, and B and C are the base vertices.Now, the problem is about the angle bisectors of the base angles. So, the base angles are at points B and C. Each of these angles will have an angle bisector, which will split the angle into two equal parts. These bisectors will intersect the opposite sides, which are the legs AC and AB, respectively. The points where these bisectors intersect the legs are what we're interested in, and we need to find the distance between these two points.Let me denote the angle bisector from point B as BD, where D is the point where the bisector intersects side AC. Similarly, the angle bisector from point C will be CE, where E is the point where the bisector intersects side AB. So, we need to find the length of segment DE.Okay, so to find DE, I probably need to find the coordinates of points D and E, and then compute the distance between them. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me set up a coordinate system.Let me place the base BC on the x-axis for simplicity. So, point B is at (0, 0), and point C is at (8, 0). Since the triangle is isosceles with AB = AC = 12 cm, the apex A must be somewhere along the y-axis above the base BC. Let me find the coordinates of point A.The length of the base BC is 8 cm, so the midpoint M of BC is at (4, 0). The height of the triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. In triangle ABM, which is a right triangle, AB is 12 cm, BM is 4 cm, so the height AM is sqrt(AB^2 - BM^2) = sqrt(144 - 16) = sqrt(128) = 8*sqrt(2) cm. So, point A is at (4, 8*sqrt(2)).Alright, so coordinates:- A: (4, 8√2)- B: (0, 0)- C: (8, 0)Now, I need to find the equations of the angle bisectors from points B and C. Let's start with the angle bisector from point B.First, let's find the angle at point B. Since triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base angles at B and C are equal. Let me compute the measure of angle B.Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC:cos(angle B) = (AB² + BC² - AC²) / (2 * AB * BC)Wait, hold on, that's not correct. Wait, in triangle ABC, sides AB and AC are equal, so angle B and angle C are equal. So, actually, using the Law of Cosines at point B:cos(angle B) = (AB² + BC² - AC²) / (2 * AB * BC)But AB = AC = 12, BC = 8.So, cos(angle B) = (12² + 8² - 12²) / (2 * 12 * 8) = (144 + 64 - 144) / (192) = 64 / 192 = 1/3.So, angle B is arccos(1/3). Similarly, angle C is also arccos(1/3).Now, the angle bisector from point B will split angle B into two equal angles of measure (1/2) arccos(1/3). Similarly, the angle bisector from point C will split angle C into two equal angles.But maybe instead of working with angles, I can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio in which the bisector divides the opposite side.The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.In triangle ABC, the angle bisector from point B will intersect side AC at point D. So, the ratio of AD to DC is equal to the ratio of AB to BC.Wait, AB is 12, BC is 8. So, AD/DC = AB/BC = 12/8 = 3/2.Therefore, AD = (3/5)*AC, and DC = (2/5)*AC.But AC is 12 cm, so AD = (3/5)*12 = 7.2 cm, and DC = (2/5)*12 = 4.8 cm.Similarly, the angle bisector from point C will intersect side AB at point E, and the ratio of AE to EB will be equal to AC/BC = 12/8 = 3/2.Therefore, AE = (3/5)*AB = (3/5)*12 = 7.2 cm, and EB = (2/5)*12 = 4.8 cm.So, now I know the lengths from A to D and from A to E, which are both 7.2 cm. Hmm, interesting.But since I have coordinate points, maybe I can find the coordinates of D and E.Point D is on AC, 7.2 cm from A. Since AC is from (4, 8√2) to (8, 0). Let me parametrize this.The vector from A to C is (8 - 4, 0 - 8√2) = (4, -8√2). The length of AC is 12 cm, so moving 7.2 cm from A towards C would be a fraction of 7.2 / 12 = 0.6 of the vector.So, the coordinates of D can be found by:D_x = A_x + 0.6*(C_x - A_x) = 4 + 0.6*(8 - 4) = 4 + 0.6*4 = 4 + 2.4 = 6.4D_y = A_y + 0.6*(C_y - A_y) = 8√2 + 0.6*(0 - 8√2) = 8√2 - 4.8√2 = 3.2√2So, point D is at (6.4, 3.2√2).Similarly, point E is on AB, 7.2 cm from A. AB is from (4, 8√2) to (0, 0). The vector from A to B is (-4, -8√2). The length of AB is 12 cm, so moving 7.2 cm from A towards B is 0.6 of the vector.So, coordinates of E:E_x = A_x + 0.6*(B_x - A_x) = 4 + 0.6*(0 - 4) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6E_y = A_y + 0.6*(B_y - A_y) = 8√2 + 0.6*(0 - 8√2) = 8√2 - 4.8√2 = 3.2√2So, point E is at (1.6, 3.2√2).Alright, so now I have points D at (6.4, 3.2√2) and E at (1.6, 3.2√2). I need to find the distance between D and E.Looking at their coordinates, both points have the same y-coordinate, 3.2√2, so the segment DE is horizontal. Therefore, the distance between D and E is simply the difference in their x-coordinates.So, DE = |D_x - E_x| = |6.4 - 1.6| = |4.8| = 4.8 cm.Wait, 4.8 cm? Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify if I did everything correctly.First, I found the coordinates of A correctly using the Pythagorean theorem. Then, using the Angle Bisector Theorem, I found the ratios AD/DC and AE/EB, both equal to 3/2. Then, I calculated the coordinates of D and E by moving 0.6 of the way from A to C and A to B, respectively.The coordinates of D and E both ended up with the same y-coordinate, which makes sense because the triangle is symmetric, and the angle bisectors from B and C should intersect the opposite sides at points that are symmetric with respect to the altitude from A. Therefore, the segment DE should be horizontal, lying somewhere above the base BC.Calculating the distance as 4.8 cm seems correct, but let me double-check the calculations.Point D:Starting from A (4, 8√2), moving 0.6 towards C (8, 0):x-coordinate: 4 + 0.6*(8 - 4) = 4 + 2.4 = 6.4y-coordinate: 8√2 + 0.6*(0 - 8√2) = 8√2 - 4.8√2 = 3.2√2Point E:Starting from A (4, 8√2), moving 0.6 towards B (0, 0):x-coordinate: 4 + 0.6*(0 - 4) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6y-coordinate: 8√2 + 0.6*(0 - 8√2) = 8√2 - 4.8√2 = 3.2√2So, both points have y-coordinate 3.2√2, which is correct. The x-coordinates are 6.4 and 1.6, so the distance is 6.4 - 1.6 = 4.8 cm.Hmm, 4.8 cm is equal to 24/5 cm, which is 4 and 4/5 cm. That seems reasonable.Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or coordinate geometry to find the equations of the angle bisectors and then find their intersection points with the legs, but that might be more complicated.Wait, another way to think about this is using the formula for the length of a segment connecting two points on the sides of a triangle, given certain ratios. But since I already have the coordinates, and the distance comes out to 4.8 cm, which is 24/5 cm, I think that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me consider another approach.Alternatively, I can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector. The angle bisector length formula states that the length of the bisector from angle B to side AC is given by:BD = (2 * AB * BC * cos(angle B / 2)) / (AB + BC)Wait, but I don't know angle B / 2, but I can compute it since I know angle B.Earlier, I found that cos(angle B) = 1/3, so angle B = arccos(1/3). Therefore, angle B / 2 = (1/2) arccos(1/3). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the length of the angle bisector:BD² = AB * BC - AD * DCFrom the Angle Bisector Theorem, AD/DC = AB/BC = 3/2, so AD = 7.2, DC = 4.8.So, BD² = AB * BC - AD * DC = 12 * 8 - 7.2 * 4.8Compute that:12 * 8 = 967.2 * 4.8: Let's compute 7 * 4.8 = 33.6, and 0.2 * 4.8 = 0.96, so total is 33.6 + 0.96 = 34.56So, BD² = 96 - 34.56 = 61.44Therefore, BD = sqrt(61.44). Let me compute that:61.44 is 6144/100 = 1536/25. sqrt(1536/25) = (sqrt(1536))/5.Simplify sqrt(1536): 1536 = 256 * 6, so sqrt(256*6) = 16*sqrt(6). So, BD = (16√6)/5 cm.Similarly, CE would be the same length, since the triangle is symmetric.But wait, I'm not sure if that helps me find DE. Maybe not directly.Alternatively, since I have the coordinates of D and E, and DE is 4.8 cm, which is 24/5 cm, which is 4.8 cm, which is equal to 16√6 / 5 divided by something? Wait, no, that's BD.Wait, BD is the length of the angle bisector, which is 16√6 / 5 cm, approximately 7.838 cm. But DE is 4.8 cm, which is less than BD.Wait, perhaps another way is to consider triangle ADE. Since both D and E are points along AC and AB, respectively, at the same distance from A, which is 7.2 cm. So, triangle ADE is also an isosceles triangle with AD = AE = 7.2 cm, and DE as its base.But wait, in triangle ADE, the apex is A, and the base is DE. Since ADE is an isosceles triangle, the length DE can be found using the Law of Cosines if we know the angle at A.But what's the angle at A? In triangle ABC, angle at A can be found since we know all sides.Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC:cos(angle A) = (AB² + AC² - BC²) / (2 * AB * AC) = (144 + 144 - 64) / (2 * 12 * 12) = (224) / (288) = 224/288 = 7/9.So, angle A = arccos(7/9). Therefore, in triangle ADE, angle at A is the same, arccos(7/9). So, using the Law of Cosines:DE² = AD² + AE² - 2 * AD * AE * cos(angle A)Since AD = AE = 7.2 cm,DE² = 7.2² + 7.2² - 2 * 7.2 * 7.2 * (7/9)Compute that:7.2² = 51.84So, DE² = 51.84 + 51.84 - 2 * 51.84 * (7/9)Compute 2 * 51.84 = 103.68103.68 * (7/9) = (103.68 / 9) * 7 = 11.52 * 7 = 80.64Therefore, DE² = 51.84 + 51.84 - 80.64 = 103.68 - 80.64 = 23.04Therefore, DE = sqrt(23.04) = 4.8 cm.So, that confirms the earlier result. DE is 4.8 cm, which is 24/5 cm.So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.Alternatively, another way is to use coordinate geometry as I did initially, which also gave me DE = 4.8 cm.Therefore, I can be confident that the length of segment DE is 4.8 cm, which is equal to 24/5 cm.**Final Answer**The length of the segment is boxed{dfrac{24}{5}} cm."},{"question":"Given the definition of the set operation: A*B={z|z=xy, xin A, yin B}.

Let E and F be the reflections of D over lines BA and BC, respectively, and let P be the intersection of lines BD and EF. Suppose that the circumcircle of triangle EPD meets omega at D and Q, and the circumcircle of triangle FPD meets omega at D and R. Show that EQ = FR.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.We have a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle ω. That means all four points lie on a circle. Also, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other. That's an important property because it might give us some right angles or equal lengths to work with.Next, E and F are the reflections of D over lines BA and BC, respectively. Hmm, reflections. So, E is the mirror image of D across BA, and F is the mirror image of D across BC. I should probably draw this out to visualize.Then, P is the intersection of lines BD and EF. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and EF is the line connecting E and F. Their intersection is point P.Now, the circumcircle of triangle EPD intersects ω again at Q. So, starting from E, P, D, we draw a circle, and it meets ω at D and another point Q. Similarly, the circumcircle of triangle FPD intersects ω again at R. So, starting from F, P, D, we draw another circle, which meets ω at D and R.We need to show that EQ equals FR. So, the lengths from E to Q and from F to R are equal.Alright, let me try to break this down.First, since ABCD is cyclic, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Also, since AC ⊥ BD, their intersection, say point O, is the orthocenter of some triangle? Wait, not necessarily, but the product of their slopes is -1 if we consider coordinate geometry. Maybe coordinate geometry could help here, but I'm not sure yet.Reflections: E is reflection of D over BA, so BA is the perpendicular bisector of DE. Similarly, BC is the perpendicular bisector of DF. So, BE = BD and BF = BD? Wait, no. Wait, reflection over a line means that the line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the original point and its reflection. So, BA is the perpendicular bisector of DE, so BE = BD and EA = ED? Wait, no, reflection over BA would mean that BA is the axis, so distances from D to BA and E to BA are equal, but not necessarily BE = BD.Wait, maybe better to consider coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to this figure.Let me place the circle ω as the unit circle in the coordinate plane. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, C, D such that ABCD is cyclic with AC ⊥ BD.Let me set point B at (1,0) for simplicity. Then, since AC ⊥ BD, and diagonals intersect at O, which is the orthocenter? Wait, maybe it's better to use complex numbers for this.Alternatively, maybe use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and reflections.Since E is the reflection of D over BA, then BA is the perpendicular bisector of DE. So, triangle BDE is isoceles with BD = BE. Similarly, triangle BDF is isoceles with BD = BF. So, BE = BF. So, E and F are both at the same distance from B, which is equal to BD. So, points E and F lie on a circle centered at B with radius BD.Hmm, interesting. So, E and F are both on this circle. So, EF is a chord of this circle. Then, point P is the intersection of BD and EF. Maybe we can find some properties about P.Also, since E and F are reflections over BA and BC, respectively, maybe angles involving E and F can be related to angles in ABCD.Let me think about the circumcircle of EPD. It intersects ω again at Q. So, Q is another intersection point. Similarly, R is another intersection point for the circumcircle of FPD.We need to show EQ = FR.Perhaps, if I can show that triangles EQD and FRD are congruent or similar, or that arcs EQ and FR are equal on ω.Alternatively, maybe use power of a point, or some cyclic quadrilateral properties.Wait, since E is the reflection of D over BA, then angle EBA = angle DBA, and similarly, angle EAB = angle DAB. Similarly for F.Wait, let me think about angles.Since E is the reflection of D over BA, then BA is the angle bisector of angle EBD. Similarly, BC is the angle bisector of angle FBD.Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps the angles at B are equal.Wait, reflection over BA would mean that the angles between BA and BD, and BA and BE are equal. So, angle ABD = angle ABE. Similarly, reflection over BC would mean angle CBD = angle CBF.So, perhaps angle EBD = angle FBD? Wait, if angle ABD = angle ABE and angle CBD = angle CBF, then angle EBD = angle ABE + angle EBD? Wait, maybe not.Wait, perhaps it's better to note that since E is reflection over BA, then BE = BD. Similarly, BF = BD. So, BE = BF, so triangle BEF is isoceles with BE = BF.Therefore, angles at E and F in triangle BEF are equal. So, angle BEF = angle BFE.Hmm, okay, but how does that help?Since P is the intersection of BD and EF, maybe we can find some ratios or similar triangles.Alternatively, maybe use inversion. Since we have cyclic quadrilaterals and reflections, inversion might be a tool.But maybe let's consider the circumcircle of EPD. It passes through E, P, D, and intersects ω again at Q. So, Q is the other intersection point. Similarly, R is the other intersection point for the circumcircle of FPD.So, perhaps Q and R are defined such that they lie on ω and on these circumcircles.We need to show EQ = FR.Wait, another approach: maybe show that Q and R are reflections over some axis, so that EQ and FR are equal.Alternatively, maybe show that triangles EQD and FRD are congruent.Wait, but I need more information about Q and R.Alternatively, maybe use spiral similarity or some other transformation.Wait, since E and F are reflections, maybe the transformation that maps E to F and vice versa is a reflection or rotation.Alternatively, since E and F are both reflections over BA and BC, maybe the line EF is symmetric with respect to BA and BC.Wait, maybe not. Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps use power of point P with respect to ω.Since P lies on BD, which is a chord of ω, and also lies on EF.Power of P with respect to ω is PB * PD = PE * PF? Wait, no, power of P with respect to ω is PB * PD = (power along BD). But also, since P lies on EF, which is a line, maybe we can relate it to the circumcircle of EPD and FPD.Wait, the power of P with respect to the circumcircle of EPD is zero because P lies on it. Similarly, power with respect to the circumcircle of FPD is zero.But maybe relate this to ω.Alternatively, maybe use radical axes.Wait, the radical axis of ω and the circumcircle of EPD is the line DQ. Similarly, the radical axis of ω and the circumcircle of FPD is the line DR.But I'm not sure if that helps.Wait, another idea: since E is reflection of D over BA, then BA is the perpendicular bisector of DE, so BA is perpendicular to DE and bisects it. Similarly, BC is perpendicular to DF and bisects it.So, DE is perpendicular to BA, and DF is perpendicular to BC.So, DE ⊥ BA and DF ⊥ BC.So, in triangle ABD, DE is perpendicular to BA, so DE is the altitude from D to BA. Similarly, DF is the altitude from D to BC in triangle CBD.Wait, but since ABCD is cyclic, maybe we can relate these altitudes.Alternatively, since DE and DF are perpendicular to BA and BC, respectively, then DE and DF are the heights from D to BA and BC.Hmm.Alternatively, maybe use coordinates.Let me try to assign coordinates to the points.Let me set the circle ω as the unit circle in the coordinate plane.Let me assign point B at (1,0). Let me let point A be at (a,0), but wait, if B is at (1,0), then A can't be at (a,0) unless it's also on the x-axis, but then AC would be a chord, but maybe not necessarily.Wait, maybe better to assign coordinates such that the center of ω is at the origin, and radius 1.Let me assign point B at (1,0). Let me assign point D at (d, e), since it's on the unit circle, so d² + e² = 1.Since AC ⊥ BD, the slope of AC times the slope of BD is -1.But I don't know where A and C are yet.Alternatively, maybe assign coordinates such that BD is along the y-axis. Since AC ⊥ BD, AC would be along the x-axis.Wait, if BD is along the y-axis, then points B and D are (0,1) and (0,-1). Then AC is along the x-axis, so points A and C are (1,0) and (-1,0). But then ABCD would be a rectangle? Wait, no, because in a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but here diagonals are perpendicular.Wait, in a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. So, if I make ABCD a square, then diagonals are perpendicular. But in that case, reflections might be easier.Wait, but maybe I can take a square for simplicity.Let me assume ABCD is a square inscribed in the unit circle. So, points are A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0), D(0,-1). Then diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.Now, let's find E and F.E is the reflection of D over BA. BA is the line from B(0,1) to A(1,0). Let me find the equation of BA.The slope of BA is (0 - 1)/(1 - 0) = -1. So, equation is y = -x + 1.To find reflection of D(0,-1) over line BA: y = -x + 1.The formula for reflection over a line ax + by + c = 0 is:If the line is ax + by + c = 0, then the reflection of point (x0, y0) is:(x', y') = (x0 - 2a(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²), y0 - 2b(ax0 + by0 + c)/(a² + b²))So, first, write BA in standard form: y = -x + 1 => x + y - 1 = 0. So, a = 1, b = 1, c = -1.So, reflection of D(0,-1):Compute ax0 + by0 + c = 1*0 + 1*(-1) -1 = -1 -1 = -2.Then,x' = 0 - 2*1*(-2)/(1 + 1) = 0 - 2*1*(-2)/2 = 0 + 2 = 2y' = -1 - 2*1*(-2)/2 = -1 + 2 = 1So, E is at (2,1).Similarly, F is the reflection of D over BC.Point B is (0,1), point C is (-1,0). So, line BC goes from (0,1) to (-1,0). The slope is (0 - 1)/(-1 - 0) = (-1)/(-1) = 1. So, equation is y = x + 1.Standard form: x - y + 1 = 0. So, a = 1, b = -1, c = 1.Reflect D(0,-1):Compute ax0 + by0 + c = 1*0 + (-1)*(-1) +1 = 0 +1 +1 = 2.Then,x' = 0 - 2*1*(2)/(1 + 1) = 0 - 4/2 = 0 - 2 = -2y' = -1 - 2*(-1)*(2)/2 = -1 + 4/2 = -1 + 2 = 1So, F is at (-2,1).Now, P is the intersection of BD and EF.BD is the line from B(0,1) to D(0,-1). That's the vertical line x=0.EF is the line from E(2,1) to F(-2,1). That's the horizontal line y=1.So, their intersection P is at (0,1). Wait, that's point B. Hmm, but in the problem statement, P is the intersection of BD and EF. But in this case, BD is x=0, EF is y=1, so their intersection is (0,1), which is point B.But in the problem, P is defined as the intersection, so in this case, P coincides with B.But then, the circumcircle of triangle EPD: points E(2,1), P(0,1), D(0,-1). Let me find the circumcircle.Points E(2,1), P(0,1), D(0,-1). Let me find the equation.The circumcircle passes through (2,1), (0,1), (0,-1). Let me find the equation.Using the general circle equation: x² + y² + ax + by + c = 0.Plug in (2,1): 4 + 1 + 2a + b + c = 0 => 5 + 2a + b + c = 0.Plug in (0,1): 0 + 1 + 0 + b + c = 0 => 1 + b + c = 0.Plug in (0,-1): 0 + 1 + 0 - b + c = 0 => 1 - b + c = 0.So, from (0,1): 1 + b + c = 0 => b + c = -1.From (0,-1): 1 - b + c = 0 => -b + c = -1.Subtract the two equations:(b + c) - (-b + c) = (-1) - (-1)2b = 0 => b = 0.Then, from b + c = -1, c = -1.Then, from (2,1): 5 + 2a + 0 -1 = 0 => 5 + 2a -1 = 0 => 4 + 2a = 0 => a = -2.So, the equation is x² + y² - 2x -1 = 0.Rewrite: (x -1)^2 + y^2 = 2.So, the circumcircle of EPD is centered at (1,0) with radius √2.Now, ω is the unit circle centered at (0,0). The intersection points of these two circles are D(0,-1) and Q.Let me solve for their intersection.Equation of ω: x² + y² = 1.Equation of circumcircle of EPD: (x -1)^2 + y^2 = 2.Subtract the first equation from the second:(x -1)^2 + y^2 - (x² + y²) = 2 -1 => x² - 2x +1 + y² -x² - y² = 1 => -2x +1 =1 => -2x =0 => x=0.So, x=0. Plug into ω: 0 + y² =1 => y=±1.So, the intersection points are (0,1) and (0,-1). But (0,1) is point B, which is P, and (0,-1) is D. So, Q is (0,1), which is B.Wait, but in the problem statement, Q is another intersection point, so in this case, Q is B.Similarly, the circumcircle of FPD: points F(-2,1), P(0,1), D(0,-1). Let me find its equation.Points F(-2,1), P(0,1), D(0,-1). Let me find the circumcircle.Using the general circle equation: x² + y² + ax + by + c = 0.Plug in (-2,1): 4 + 1 -2a + b + c = 0 => 5 -2a + b + c = 0.Plug in (0,1): 0 +1 +0 + b + c = 0 =>1 + b + c = 0.Plug in (0,-1):0 +1 +0 -b + c =0 =>1 -b + c =0.From (0,1): b + c = -1.From (0,-1): -b + c = -1.Subtract: 2b =0 => b=0. Then c = -1.From (-2,1):5 -2a +0 -1 =0 =>4 -2a=0 =>a=2.So, equation is x² + y² +2x -1=0.Rewrite: (x +1)^2 + y^2 = 2.So, the circumcircle of FPD is centered at (-1,0) with radius √2.Intersection with ω: x² + y² =1.Subtract equations:(x +1)^2 + y^2 - (x² + y²) = 2 -1 => x² +2x +1 + y² -x² - y² =1 =>2x +1=1 =>2x=0 =>x=0.So, x=0. Plug into ω: y²=1 => y=±1. So, intersection points are (0,1) and (0,-1). So, R is (0,1), which is B.Wait, so in this case, Q and R both coincide with B. So, EQ is the distance from E(2,1) to Q(0,1), which is 2 units. Similarly, FR is the distance from F(-2,1) to R(0,1), which is also 2 units. So, EQ = FR.So, in this specific case, it holds.But wait, in this case, P coincided with B. Maybe in the general case, P is different.Wait, but in the square case, P is B because EF is the line y=1, which intersects BD at B. So, in this case, P is B.But in the general case, maybe P is different.Wait, but in the square case, it worked out because Q and R coincided with B, making EQ and FR both equal to 2.But in the general case, maybe Q and R are different points.Wait, perhaps I need to consider another configuration where P is not B.Alternatively, maybe the square case is too symmetric, and in the general case, the result still holds.Alternatively, maybe try another cyclic quadrilateral where diagonals are perpendicular but not a square.Let me choose another cyclic quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals.Let me take ω as the unit circle again. Let me choose points A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0), D(0,-1). Wait, that's the square again.Wait, maybe choose a different quadrilateral.Let me choose A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0), D(0, k), where k is such that AC ⊥ BD.Wait, AC is from (1,0) to (-1,0), which is horizontal. BD is from (0,1) to (0,k). So, BD is vertical. So, AC is horizontal, BD is vertical, so they are perpendicular. So, any D on the y-axis would make AC ⊥ BD.So, let me take D(0, k), with k ≠ -1, so that ABCD is convex.Let me take k = 1/2, so D is (0, 1/2).Now, let's compute E and F.E is the reflection of D over BA.BA is from B(0,1) to A(1,0). The equation of BA is y = -x +1.So, reflecting D(0, 1/2) over BA.Using the reflection formula.Line BA: x + y -1 =0.So, a=1, b=1, c=-1.Compute ax0 + by0 + c =1*0 +1*(1/2) -1= 1/2 -1= -1/2.Then,x' = 0 - 2*1*(-1/2)/(1+1)= 0 - (-1)/1= 1y' = 1/2 - 2*1*(-1/2)/2= 1/2 + (1)/2=1So, E is at (1,1).Similarly, F is the reflection of D over BC.BC is from B(0,1) to C(-1,0). The equation of BC is y = x +1.Standard form: x - y +1=0. So, a=1, b=-1, c=1.Reflect D(0,1/2):Compute ax0 + by0 +c=1*0 + (-1)*(1/2)+1= -1/2 +1=1/2.Then,x' =0 - 2*1*(1/2)/(1+1)=0 - (1)/1= -1y' =1/2 - 2*(-1)*(1/2)/2=1/2 + (1)/2=1So, F is at (-1,1).Now, P is the intersection of BD and EF.BD is from B(0,1) to D(0,1/2). That's the vertical line x=0.EF is from E(1,1) to F(-1,1). That's the horizontal line y=1.So, their intersection P is at (0,1), which is point B again.So, same as before, P is B.Then, the circumcircle of EPD: points E(1,1), P(0,1), D(0,1/2).Let me find its equation.Using general circle equation: x² + y² + ax + by + c=0.Plug in E(1,1):1 +1 +a +b +c=0 =>2 +a +b +c=0.Plug in P(0,1):0 +1 +0 +b +c=0 =>1 +b +c=0.Plug in D(0,1/2):0 +1/4 +0 + (b)(1/2) +c=0 =>1/4 + (b/2) +c=0.From P:1 +b +c=0 => b +c = -1.From D:1/4 + b/2 +c=0.Let me subtract equation from D multiplied by 2:2*(1/4 + b/2 +c)= 1/2 + b + 2c=0.But from P: b + c = -1.So, subtract:(1/2 + b + 2c) - (b + c) = 1/2 + c = 1/2 + c =0 => c= -1/2.Then, from P: b + (-1/2)= -1 =>b= -1 +1/2= -1/2.From E: 2 +a + (-1/2) + (-1/2)=0 =>2 +a -1=0 =>a= -1.So, equation: x² + y² -x - (1/2)y -1/2=0.Multiply by 2: 2x² + 2y² -2x - y -1=0.Now, find intersection with ω: x² + y² =1.Subtract: (2x² + 2y² -2x - y -1) - 2(x² + y² -1)=0 => -2x - y -1 +2=0 => -2x - y +1=0 =>2x + y =1.So, the radical axis is 2x + y =1.But ω and the circumcircle intersect at D(0,1/2) and Q.So, solve 2x + y =1 and x² + y²=1.From 2x + y =1, y=1 -2x.Plug into circle: x² + (1 -2x)^2 =1 =>x² +1 -4x +4x²=1 =>5x² -4x=0 =>x(5x -4)=0.So, x=0 or x=4/5.If x=0, y=1. So, point is (0,1), which is B.If x=4/5, y=1 -8/5= -3/5. So, point Q is (4/5, -3/5).Similarly, the circumcircle of FPD: points F(-1,1), P(0,1), D(0,1/2).Let me find its equation.Using general circle equation: x² + y² + ax + by +c=0.Plug in F(-1,1):1 +1 -a +b +c=0 =>2 -a +b +c=0.Plug in P(0,1):0 +1 +0 +b +c=0 =>1 +b +c=0.Plug in D(0,1/2):0 +1/4 +0 + (b)(1/2) +c=0 =>1/4 + (b/2) +c=0.From P:1 +b +c=0 =>b +c= -1.From D:1/4 + b/2 +c=0.Multiply by 2:1/2 +b +2c=0.Subtract equation from P: (1/2 +b +2c) - (b +c)=1/2 +c=0 =>c= -1/2.Then, from P: b + (-1/2)= -1 =>b= -1 +1/2= -1/2.From F:2 -a + (-1/2) + (-1/2)=0 =>2 -a -1=0 =>a=1.So, equation: x² + y² +x - (1/2)y -1/2=0.Multiply by 2:2x² +2y² +2x - y -1=0.Find intersection with ω: x² + y²=1.Subtract: (2x² +2y² +2x - y -1) -2(x² + y² -1)=0 =>2x - y -1 +2=0 =>2x - y +1=0 =>2x - y = -1.So, radical axis is 2x - y = -1.Intersection with ω: x² + y²=1.From 2x - y = -1, y=2x +1.Plug into circle: x² + (2x +1)^2=1 =>x² +4x² +4x +1=1 =>5x² +4x=0 =>x(5x +4)=0.So, x=0 or x= -4/5.If x=0, y=1. So, point is (0,1), which is B.If x= -4/5, y=2*(-4/5)+1= -8/5 +5/5= -3/5. So, point R is (-4/5, -3/5).Now, compute EQ and FR.Point E is (1,1), Q is (4/5, -3/5).Distance EQ: sqrt[(4/5 -1)^2 + (-3/5 -1)^2] = sqrt[(-1/5)^2 + (-8/5)^2] = sqrt[1/25 +64/25]=sqrt[65/25]=sqrt(13/5).Point F is (-1,1), R is (-4/5, -3/5).Distance FR: sqrt[(-4/5 +1)^2 + (-3/5 -1)^2] = sqrt[(1/5)^2 + (-8/5)^2] = sqrt[1/25 +64/25]=sqrt[65/25]=sqrt(13/5).So, EQ=FR.So, in this case, it also holds.Hmm, so in both the square case and another case, EQ=FR.So, maybe the result is general.But in both cases, P coincided with B because EF was horizontal and BD was vertical, intersecting at B.Wait, but in the square case, EF was y=1, BD was x=0, so intersection at (0,1)=B.In the second case, EF was from (1,1) to (-1,1), which is y=1, BD is x=0, so again intersection at (0,1)=B.So, in these cases, P=B.But in the problem statement, P is defined as the intersection of BD and EF, which in these cases is B.But in the problem statement, E and F are reflections over BA and BC, which in these cases led to EF being horizontal at y=1, intersecting BD at B.But perhaps in a different configuration, P is not B.Wait, maybe if I take a different quadrilateral where EF is not horizontal.Wait, let me try another configuration.Let me take ω as the unit circle.Let me choose A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0), D(0,k), but choose k such that BD is not vertical.Wait, but if I take D not on the y-axis, then AC won't be perpendicular to BD.Wait, AC is from (1,0) to (-1,0), which is horizontal. So, BD must be vertical for AC ⊥ BD.Wait, no, if AC is horizontal, then BD must be vertical for them to be perpendicular.So, in this setup, BD must be vertical, so D must be on the y-axis.So, in this case, EF is always horizontal at y=1, because E and F are reflections over BA and BC, which in this case are lines with slopes -1 and 1, leading to E and F at (1,1) and (-1,1).Thus, in this setup, EF is always y=1, so intersection with BD is always at (0,1)=B.So, in this case, P is always B.But in the problem statement, E and F are reflections over BA and BC, but in the square case, BA and BC are specific lines.Wait, maybe in a different cyclic quadrilateral with AC ⊥ BD, but not symmetric like the square.Let me try to choose a different quadrilateral.Let me take ω as the unit circle.Let me choose A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0), D(0,-1). So, again, the square.But as before, EF is y=1, so P=B.Wait, maybe I need a different configuration where BD is not vertical.Wait, but if AC is horizontal, BD must be vertical for them to be perpendicular.Alternatively, maybe take AC not horizontal.Wait, let me take another cyclic quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals.Let me take A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0), D(0,1). Wait, but D coincides with B, which is not allowed.Wait, maybe take D somewhere else.Wait, let me take A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0), D(0, k), but with k ≠1, -1.Wait, but as before, AC is horizontal, BD is vertical.Wait, perhaps I need a different coordinate system.Alternatively, maybe take a different circle.Wait, maybe take ω as a circle with center not at origin.Wait, maybe take ω as the circle with center at (h,0), radius r.But this might complicate things.Alternatively, maybe consider a different cyclic quadrilateral.Wait, let me take ABCD with A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0), D(0,1). Wait, but D coincides with B.Not good.Wait, maybe take D(0, k), with k ≠1, -1.Wait, but as before, in that case, BD is vertical, so P is B.Wait, perhaps in all such configurations, P is B.Wait, but in the problem statement, E and F are reflections over BA and BC, which in the square case led to EF being horizontal, intersecting BD at B.But in the problem statement, P is defined as the intersection of BD and EF, which in these cases is B.But in the problem statement, E and F are reflections over BA and BC, which are sides of the quadrilateral.Wait, maybe in general, EF passes through B, making P=B.Wait, in the square case, yes, EF is the line y=1, passing through B(0,1).Similarly, in the second case, EF was y=1, passing through B(0,1).So, maybe in general, EF passes through B, making P=B.If that's the case, then the circumcircle of EPD passes through E, P=B, D, and intersects ω again at Q.Similarly, circumcircle of FPD passes through F, P=B, D, and intersects ω again at R.So, in this case, Q and R are the second intersections of the circumcircles of EBD and FBD with ω.Wait, but in the square case, Q and R both coincided with B, but in the second case, Q and R were different points.Wait, in the second case, Q was (4/5, -3/5) and R was (-4/5, -3/5).So, in that case, EQ and FR were both sqrt(13/5).So, in that case, it worked.But in the square case, Q and R coincided with B, making EQ and FR both equal to 2.So, maybe in general, EQ=FR.But I need to find a general proof.Wait, let's think about it.Since E is reflection of D over BA, then BE=BD, as reflection preserves distance.Similarly, BF=BD.So, BE=BF.So, E and F lie on a circle centered at B with radius BD.So, BE=BF.So, triangle BEF is isoceles with BE=BF.Therefore, angles at E and F are equal.Moreover, since E and F are reflections over BA and BC, respectively, the angles between BE and BA, and BF and BC are equal.Wait, maybe.Alternatively, since E is reflection over BA, then angle EBA = angle DBA.Similarly, F is reflection over BC, so angle FBC = angle DBC.So, angle EBA = angle DBA and angle FBC = angle DBC.But since ABCD is cyclic, angle DBA = angle DCA, because they subtend the same arc.Wait, maybe not.Wait, in cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to 180, and angles subtended by the same chord are equal.Wait, maybe use power of a point.Wait, since E lies on the reflection over BA, then power of E with respect to ω.Wait, power of E: EA * EB = EC * ED? Wait, not sure.Wait, since E is reflection over BA, then EA=ED, because reflection preserves distance.Wait, no, reflection over BA means that BA is the perpendicular bisector of DE, so ED=EB.Wait, no, reflection over BA would mean that E is the mirror image of D across BA, so BE=BD.Wait, yes, as reflection preserves distance.So, BE=BD, and similarly BF=BD.So, BE=BF.So, E and F lie on a circle centered at B with radius BD.So, BE=BF.So, triangle BEF is isoceles with BE=BF.Therefore, angles at E and F are equal.Moreover, since E is reflection over BA, angle EBA = angle DBA.Similarly, angle FBC = angle DBC.But since ABCD is cyclic, angle DBA = angle DCA.Wait, maybe not directly.Alternatively, since AC ⊥ BD, maybe some right triangles can be used.Wait, since AC ⊥ BD, and ABCD is cyclic, then ABCD is an orthodiagonal cyclic quadrilateral.In such quadrilaterals, the sum of squares of two opposite sides equals the sum of squares of the other two opposite sides.But not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, maybe use spiral similarity.Wait, since E and F are reflections, maybe there is a spiral similarity that maps E to F and vice versa.Alternatively, maybe use inversion.But perhaps another approach.Since E is reflection of D over BA, then BA is the perpendicular bisector of DE, so DE ⊥ BA.Similarly, DF ⊥ BC.So, DE ⊥ BA and DF ⊥ BC.So, in triangle ABD, DE is the altitude from D to BA.Similarly, in triangle CBD, DF is the altitude from D to BC.So, maybe use properties of orthocenters.Wait, but not sure.Alternatively, since DE ⊥ BA and DF ⊥ BC, then DE and DF are the heights from D to BA and BC.So, in triangle ABD, DE is the altitude, and in triangle CBD, DF is the altitude.So, maybe use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and orthocenters.Wait, but perhaps it's better to consider the circumcircles.Since Q is the second intersection of circumcircle of EPD with ω, and R is the second intersection of circumcircle of FPD with ω.We need to show that EQ=FR.Alternatively, maybe show that Q and R are symmetric with respect to some axis, making EQ=FR.Alternatively, maybe show that Q and R are reflections over the perpendicular bisector of EF.Wait, since E and F are symmetric with respect to BA and BC, maybe Q and R are symmetric in some way.Alternatively, maybe use the fact that BE=BF and angles at E and F are equal.Wait, let me think about the circumcircle of EPD.It passes through E, P, D, and Q.Similarly, the circumcircle of FPD passes through F, P, D, and R.Since P is the intersection of BD and EF, and in our previous examples, P was B.But in the problem statement, maybe P is not necessarily B.Wait, but in our examples, it was B because EF was passing through B.Wait, maybe in general, EF passes through B.Wait, since E is reflection over BA, and F is reflection over BC, then line EF is the reflection of line DF over BA and BC.Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, since E and F are reflections, maybe line EF is symmetric with respect to BA and BC.Wait, in our examples, EF was horizontal, passing through B.Wait, maybe in general, EF passes through B.Wait, let's see.In the square case, EF was y=1, passing through B(0,1).In the second case, EF was y=1, passing through B(0,1).So, in both cases, EF passes through B.So, maybe in general, EF passes through B.Therefore, P is the intersection of BD and EF, which is B.Therefore, P=B.So, in general, P=B.Therefore, the circumcircle of EPD is the circumcircle of E, B, D, and Q.Similarly, circumcircle of FPD is the circumcircle of F, B, D, and R.So, Q and R are the second intersections of these circles with ω.So, in this case, since E and F are reflections over BA and BC, and BE=BF, maybe the arcs EQ and FR are equal.Alternatively, since BE=BF, and angles subtended by EQ and FR are equal, making EQ=FR.Alternatively, since E and F are symmetric with respect to some axis, Q and R are symmetric, making EQ=FR.Alternatively, maybe use power of point E with respect to ω.Power of E: EQ * ED = EB * EA.Wait, but not sure.Wait, since E lies outside ω, the power of E with respect to ω is equal to EQ * ED.Similarly, power of F with respect to ω is FR * FD.But since E and F are reflections, maybe their powers are equal.But wait, power of E: EQ * ED = EB^2 - r^2, where r is radius of ω.Similarly, power of F: FR * FD = FB^2 - r^2.But since EB=FB, then EQ * ED = FR * FD.But ED=FD? Wait, no, ED is the distance from E to D, FD is the distance from F to D.Wait, but E is reflection of D over BA, so ED=2*distance from D to BA.Similarly, FD=2*distance from D to BC.But unless BA and BC are equidistant from D, which is not necessarily the case.Wait, but in our examples, ED and FD were equal because of the symmetry.Wait, in the square case, ED=FD=√2.In the second case, E was (1,1), D was (0,1/2). So, ED= sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (1 -1/2)^2]=sqrt[1 +1/4]=sqrt(5/4)=√5/2.Similarly, F was (-1,1), D was (0,1/2). So, FD= sqrt[(-1 -0)^2 + (1 -1/2)^2]=sqrt[1 +1/4]=√5/2.So, in that case, ED=FD.So, in general, since E and F are reflections over BA and BC, which are sides of the quadrilateral, maybe ED=FD.Wait, is that always true?Wait, since E is reflection over BA, so BA is the perpendicular bisector of DE, so BE=BD.Similarly, F is reflection over BC, so BC is the perpendicular bisector of DF, so BF=BD.So, BE=BF=BD.So, in triangle EBD and FBD, we have BE=BF=BD.So, triangles EBD and FBD are congruent.Therefore, ED=FD.So, yes, ED=FD.Therefore, in the power of E and F with respect to ω, EQ * ED = FR * FD, and since ED=FD, then EQ=FR.Wait, that seems promising.Let me write that down.Since E is reflection over BA, BE=BD.Similarly, F is reflection over BC, so BF=BD.Thus, BE=BF.Moreover, since E is reflection over BA, BA is perpendicular bisector of DE, so DE is perpendicular to BA, and similarly DF is perpendicular to BC.Moreover, since E and F are reflections, triangles EBD and FBD are congruent, so ED=FD.Now, consider the power of E with respect to ω.Power of E: EQ * ED = EB^2 - r^2, where r is radius of ω.Similarly, power of F: FR * FD = FB^2 - r^2.But since EB=FB and ED=FD, then EQ * ED = FR * FD.But ED=FD, so EQ=FR.Therefore, EQ=FR.So, that's the proof.**Final Answer**boxed{EQ = FR}"},{"question":"Given that point P moves on the circle x^2+y^2=1, the minimum distance from P to the line 3x+4y+15=0 is ____.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: Point P moves on the circle defined by the equation x² + y² = 1. I need to find the minimum distance from P to the line 3x + 4y + 15 = 0. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the distance from a point to a line can be calculated using a specific formula. I think it's something like |Ax + By + C| divided by the square root of (A² + B²), where Ax + By + C = 0 is the equation of the line. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I think that's right. So, the distance d from a point (x, y) to the line 3x + 4y + 15 = 0 would be |3x + 4y + 15| / sqrt(3² + 4²). Calculating the denominator, sqrt(9 + 16) is sqrt(25), which is 5. So, the distance simplifies to |3x + 4y + 15| / 5.Alright, so I need to find the minimum value of this distance as point P moves along the circle x² + y² = 1. That means I need to minimize the expression |3x + 4y + 15| / 5, subject to the condition that x² + y² = 1.Hmm, since the denominator is a constant (5), minimizing the distance is equivalent to minimizing the numerator |3x + 4y + 15|. So, maybe I can just focus on minimizing |3x + 4y + 15|.Wait, but since the absolute value complicates things a bit, perhaps I can instead consider minimizing the expression 3x + 4y + 15, keeping in mind that the minimum distance could be on either side of the line. But actually, since we're dealing with a circle and a line, the minimum distance should occur at the point on the circle closest to the line.Another approach I remember is that the minimum distance from a point to a line can be found by projecting the point onto the line. But in this case, since the point is constrained to lie on a circle, maybe I can use some geometric reasoning.Let me recall that the distance from the center of the circle to the line can help. If I find the distance from the origin (since the circle is centered at (0,0)) to the line 3x + 4y + 15 = 0, and then subtract the radius of the circle, that should give me the minimum distance from any point on the circle to the line.Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If the distance from the center to the line is greater than the radius, then the minimum distance from the circle to the line would be the distance from the center minus the radius. If it's less, then the minimum distance would be zero because the line would intersect the circle. But in this case, let's compute the distance from the origin to the line.Using the distance formula: |3*0 + 4*0 + 15| / sqrt(3² + 4²) = |15| / 5 = 3. So, the distance from the center (origin) to the line is 3 units. The radius of the circle is 1, since x² + y² = 1.So, since 3 > 1, the line doesn't intersect the circle, and the minimum distance from any point on the circle to the line should be 3 - 1 = 2. Is that right? Wait, hold on. Let me double-check.If the distance from the center to the line is D, and the radius is r, then the minimum distance from the circle to the line is D - r if D > r. If D < r, then the minimum distance is zero because the line intersects the circle. So, in this case, D = 3, r = 1, so 3 - 1 = 2. Therefore, the minimum distance should be 2.But wait, let me verify this with another method to be sure. Maybe using calculus or Lagrange multipliers.Let me try using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We need to minimize the function f(x, y) = |3x + 4y + 15| / 5 subject to the constraint g(x, y) = x² + y² - 1 = 0.But since the absolute value complicates things, perhaps I can instead minimize the square of the distance, which would be (3x + 4y + 15)² / 25. Since the square is a monotonic function for non-negative values, minimizing this should give the same result as minimizing the original distance.So, let's define F(x, y, λ) = (3x + 4y + 15)² / 25 + λ(x² + y² - 1). Taking partial derivatives:First, partial derivative with respect to x:dF/dx = [2*(3x + 4y + 15)*(3)] / 25 + 2λx = 0Similarly, partial derivative with respect to y:dF/dy = [2*(3x + 4y + 15)*(4)] / 25 + 2λy = 0And partial derivative with respect to λ:dF/dλ = x² + y² - 1 = 0So, simplifying the first two equations:From dF/dx: [6*(3x + 4y + 15)] / 25 + 2λx = 0From dF/dy: [8*(3x + 4y + 15)] / 25 + 2λy = 0Let me denote (3x + 4y + 15) as K for simplicity. Then, the equations become:(6K)/25 + 2λx = 0 --> (6K)/25 = -2λx --> (3K)/25 = -λxSimilarly, (8K)/25 + 2λy = 0 --> (8K)/25 = -2λy --> (4K)/25 = -λySo, from the first equation: λ = -(3K)/(25x)From the second equation: λ = -(4K)/(25y)Therefore, setting them equal: -(3K)/(25x) = -(4K)/(25y)Simplify: 3K/(25x) = 4K/(25y)Assuming K ≠ 0 (since if K = 0, then 3x + 4y + 15 = 0, but since the circle is x² + y² = 1, plugging into the line equation: 3x + 4y = -15, but 3x + 4y can't be -15 because the maximum value of 3x + 4y on the unit circle is sqrt(3² + 4²) = 5, so 3x + 4y ranges from -5 to 5. So, K can't be zero here. Therefore, we can divide both sides by K:3/(25x) = 4/(25y) --> 3/y = 4/x --> 3x = 4y --> y = (3/4)xSo, we have y = (3/4)x. Now, plug this into the constraint x² + y² = 1:x² + (9/16)x² = 1 --> (16/16 + 9/16)x² = 1 --> (25/16)x² = 1 --> x² = 16/25 --> x = ±4/5Therefore, x = 4/5 or x = -4/5Then, y = (3/4)x, so:If x = 4/5, y = (3/4)*(4/5) = 3/5If x = -4/5, y = (3/4)*(-4/5) = -3/5So, the two points are (4/5, 3/5) and (-4/5, -3/5)Now, let's compute the distance from each of these points to the line 3x + 4y + 15 = 0.First, for (4/5, 3/5):Distance = |3*(4/5) + 4*(3/5) + 15| / 5 = |12/5 + 12/5 + 15| / 5 = |24/5 + 15| / 5 = |24/5 + 75/5| / 5 = |99/5| / 5 = (99/5)/5 = 99/25 = 3.96Wait, that's 3.96, which is 99/25.But wait, that seems larger than the distance from the center, which was 3. So, maybe this is the maximum distance?Similarly, for (-4/5, -3/5):Distance = |3*(-4/5) + 4*(-3/5) + 15| /5 = |-12/5 -12/5 +15| /5 = |-24/5 + 15| /5 = |-24/5 + 75/5| /5 = |51/5| /5 = 51/25 = 2.04Ah, so 51/25 is 2.04, which is approximately 2.04. Which is 3 - 1 = 2, but 51/25 is 2.04, which is slightly more than 2. Wait, that's confusing.Wait, 51/25 is 2.04, which is actually 2 + 1/25, so 2.04, which is more than 2. So, why is the minimum distance 2.04? But earlier, I thought it was 2.Wait, perhaps my initial reasoning was wrong. Let me recast the problem.Wait, the distance from the center to the line is 3, and the radius is 1, so the minimum distance should be 3 - 1 = 2, and the maximum distance should be 3 + 1 = 4.But according to the calculations above, the distance from (4/5, 3/5) is 99/25 = 3.96, which is approximately 4, and the distance from (-4/5, -3/5) is 51/25 = 2.04, which is approximately 2.04.So, that seems consistent. So, the minimum distance is 51/25, which is 2.04, and the maximum is 99/25, which is 3.96.Wait, so why did I think it was 2? Maybe I made a mistake in my initial reasoning.Wait, let me think again. The distance from the center to the line is 3. The radius is 1. So, the closest point on the circle to the line would be along the line connecting the center to the given line, right? So, moving from the center towards the line by the radius length.But in that case, the minimum distance should be 3 - 1 = 2. But according to the calculation, it's 51/25, which is 2.04, which is more than 2. So, that suggests that my initial reasoning was wrong.Wait, maybe the direction from the center to the line is not the same as the direction of the point on the circle? Hmm, perhaps I need to visualize this.Wait, the line is 3x + 4y + 15 = 0. The center is at (0,0). The vector normal to the line is (3,4). So, the direction from the center towards the line is in the direction of (3,4). So, the point on the circle in that direction would be (3/5, 4/5), since (3,4) normalized is (3/5, 4/5). Then, the distance from that point to the line would be |3*(3/5) + 4*(4/5) + 15| /5 = |9/5 + 16/5 + 15| /5 = |25/5 + 15| /5 = |5 + 15| /5 = 20/5 = 4. So, that's the maximum distance.Wait, but the point (-3/5, -4/5) would be in the opposite direction. So, the distance from (-3/5, -4/5) to the line would be |3*(-3/5) + 4*(-4/5) +15| /5 = |-9/5 -16/5 +15| /5 = |-25/5 +15| /5 = |-5 +15| /5 = 10/5 = 2. So, that's 2. So, that's the minimum distance.Wait, but earlier when I used Lagrange multipliers, I got points (4/5, 3/5) and (-4/5, -3/5). But that seems different.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in my Lagrange multiplier method.Wait, let's go back. When I set up the Lagrangian, I considered the square of the distance, which is (3x + 4y +15)^2 /25. Then, I took partial derivatives.Wait, but actually, the distance function is |3x + 4y +15| /5, so when I square it, it's (3x +4y +15)^2 /25. So, that part is correct.Then, taking the partial derivatives:dF/dx = [2*(3x +4y +15)*3]/25 + 2λx = 0Similarly, dF/dy = [2*(3x +4y +15)*4]/25 + 2λy = 0So, that's correct.Then, I set K = 3x +4y +15, so:From dF/dx: (6K)/25 + 2λx = 0 --> 6K + 50λx = 0From dF/dy: (8K)/25 + 2λy = 0 --> 8K + 50λy = 0So, 6K + 50λx = 08K + 50λy = 0So, let's write these as:6K = -50λx8K = -50λyDivide the two equations:(6K)/(8K) = (-50λx)/(-50λy) --> 6/8 = x/y --> 3/4 = x/y --> y = (4/3)xWait, hold on, earlier I thought y = (3/4)x, but actually, it's y = (4/3)x.Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. So, in the previous step, I had:From 6K = -50λx and 8K = -50λy, so dividing the first equation by the second:(6K)/(8K) = ( -50λx ) / ( -50λy ) --> 6/8 = x/y --> 3/4 = x/y --> y = (4/3)xSo, that's different from what I had before. So, y = (4/3)x.So, plugging back into the constraint x² + y² = 1:x² + (16/9)x² = 1 --> (9/9 + 16/9)x² = 1 --> (25/9)x² = 1 --> x² = 9/25 --> x = ±3/5Therefore, x = 3/5 or x = -3/5Then, y = (4/3)x, so:If x = 3/5, y = (4/3)*(3/5) = 4/5If x = -3/5, y = (4/3)*(-3/5) = -4/5So, the two points are (3/5, 4/5) and (-3/5, -4/5)Now, let's compute the distance from these points to the line.First, for (3/5, 4/5):Distance = |3*(3/5) + 4*(4/5) +15| /5 = |9/5 + 16/5 +15| /5 = |25/5 +15| /5 = |5 +15| /5 = 20/5 = 4For (-3/5, -4/5):Distance = |3*(-3/5) + 4*(-4/5) +15| /5 = |-9/5 -16/5 +15| /5 = |-25/5 +15| /5 = |-5 +15| /5 = 10/5 = 2Ah, okay, so that makes sense. So, the minimum distance is 2, and the maximum is 4.Wait, so why did I get different points earlier? Because I made a mistake in the ratio. I thought y = (3/4)x, but actually, it's y = (4/3)x. So, that was the error.Therefore, the minimum distance is 2.So, going back, my initial reasoning was correct: the minimum distance is the distance from the center to the line minus the radius. Since the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is 3, and the radius is 1, the minimum distance is 3 - 1 = 2.Therefore, the minimum distance is 2.But wait, just to make sure, let me compute the distance from (-3/5, -4/5) to the line:3*(-3/5) + 4*(-4/5) +15 = -9/5 -16/5 +15 = (-25/5) +15 = -5 +15 = 10So, the absolute value is 10, divided by 5 is 2. Yep, that's correct.So, the minimum distance is indeed 2.Therefore, the answer is 2.**Final Answer**The minimum distance from P to the line is boxed{2}."},{"question":"If x > 0, find the minimum value of x + frac{4}{x}.","answer":"To find the minimum value of the function ( f(x) = x + frac{4}{x} ) for ( x > 0 ), I'll start by finding its derivative to identify critical points.The derivative of ( f(x) ) with respect to ( x ) is:[f'(x) = 1 - frac{4}{x^2}]Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:[1 - frac{4}{x^2} = 0][frac{4}{x^2} = 1][x^2 = 4][x = 2 quad (text{since } x > 0)]Next, I'll confirm whether this critical point is a minimum by examining the second derivative:[f''(x) = frac{8}{x^3}]At ( x = 2 ):[f''(2) = frac{8}{8} = 1 > 0]Since the second derivative is positive, the function has a local minimum at ( x = 2 ).Finally, I'll calculate the minimum value by substituting ( x = 2 ) back into the original function:[f(2) = 2 + frac{4}{2} = 2 + 2 = 4]"},{"question":"The product of three consecutive positive integers is 8 times their sum.

(1) Find the value of the real number b;  (2) If the complex number omega=frac{z}{1-i}, find the modulus of omega.","answer":"Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.We have a complex number z = 2 + bi, where b is greater than 0, and i is the imaginary unit. The first part says that z squared is a purely imaginary number. I need to find the value of the real number b. Then, in the second part, I have another complex number ω = z / (1 - i), and I need to find the modulus of ω.Alright, let's tackle part (1) first. So, z is 2 + bi, and when we square it, it becomes purely imaginary. That means the real part of z squared is zero. So, I can write z squared as (2 + bi)^2 and then set the real part equal to zero to solve for b.Let me compute z squared step by step. Using the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, but since b is multiplied by i, it's actually (2 + bi)^2. So, expanding that:(2 + bi)^2 = 2^2 + 2*(2)*(bi) + (bi)^2= 4 + 4bi + (b^2)(i^2)But wait, i^2 is equal to -1, right? So, substituting that in:= 4 + 4bi + (b^2)*(-1)= 4 + 4bi - b^2So, combining like terms, we have:(4 - b^2) + 4biNow, since z squared is purely imaginary, the real part must be zero. So, the real part is (4 - b^2). Therefore, we can set up the equation:4 - b^2 = 0Solving for b:b^2 = 4Taking square roots of both sides:b = ±2But wait, the problem says b > 0, so b must be 2.Okay, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Expanded (2 + bi)^2 correctly: 4 + 4bi + (bi)^22. Replaced i^2 with -1: 4 + 4bi - b^23. Separated real and imaginary parts: (4 - b^2) + 4bi4. Set real part equal to zero: 4 - b^2 = 05. Solved for b: b = 2Looks good. So, part (1) answer is b = 2.Now, moving on to part (2). We have ω = z / (1 - i). We need to find the modulus of ω. First, let's recall that the modulus of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Also, the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli, so |ω| = |z| / |1 - i|.Alternatively, I can compute ω first by performing the division and then find its modulus. Maybe both methods can help me verify the answer.Let me try both approaches.First, using the modulus properties:|ω| = |z| / |1 - i|Compute |z|: z is 2 + bi, which we found b = 2, so z = 2 + 2i.So, |z| = sqrt(2^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2)Compute |1 - i|: The modulus is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2)Therefore, |ω| = (2*sqrt(2)) / sqrt(2) = 2Wait, that seems simple. Let me try the other method to confirm.Compute ω = z / (1 - i) = (2 + 2i) / (1 - i)To simplify this, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 + i):ω = [(2 + 2i)(1 + i)] / [(1 - i)(1 + i)]First, compute the denominator:(1 - i)(1 + i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2Now, compute the numerator:(2 + 2i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + 2i*1 + 2i*i= 2 + 2i + 2i + 2i^2= 2 + 4i + 2*(-1)= 2 + 4i - 2= (2 - 2) + 4i= 0 + 4i= 4iTherefore, ω = (4i) / 2 = 2iSo, ω is 0 + 2i, which is a purely imaginary number. The modulus of ω is sqrt(0^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(4) = 2So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.Therefore, the modulus of ω is 2.Let me just recap what I did:1. For part (1), I expanded z squared, set the real part to zero, and solved for b, getting b = 2.2. For part (2), I used two methods: one using modulus properties and another by directly computing ω. Both gave me |ω| = 2.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**(1) The value of ( b ) is boxed{2}.(2) The modulus of ( omega ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"On a board, the first 20 natural numbers were written. When one of the numbers was erased, it turned out that among the remaining numbers, one is the arithmetic mean of all the others. Find all numbers that could have been erased.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where the first 20 natural numbers are written on a board. Someone erased one of them, and now among the remaining numbers, one number is the arithmetic mean of all the others. I need to find all the numbers that could have been erased. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The numbers on the board initially are 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 20. So that's 20 numbers in total. One number is erased, so now there are 19 numbers left. Among these 19 numbers, one of them is the arithmetic mean of the other 18. So, if I denote the erased number as 'x', then among the remaining numbers, there exists a number 'a' such that 'a' is equal to the average of the other 18 numbers.Let me write down what I know:- Original numbers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 20- Total count: 20- Sum of the original numbers: Let's calculate that. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by n(n + 1)/2. So, for n = 20, the sum is 20*21/2 = 210.So, the total sum is 210. After erasing a number 'x', the sum becomes 210 - x. Now, among the remaining 19 numbers, one of them is the arithmetic mean of the other 18. Let's denote this number as 'a'. So, the arithmetic mean of the other 18 numbers is 'a'. The arithmetic mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the count of the numbers. So, the sum of the other 18 numbers is 18*a. Therefore, we have:Sum of remaining 19 numbers = a + 18*a = 19*aBut the sum of the remaining 19 numbers is also equal to 210 - x. So, we can write:19*a = 210 - xWhich implies:x = 210 - 19*aSo, x is equal to 210 minus 19 times a. Now, both x and a are natural numbers between 1 and 20. So, x must be one of the numbers from 1 to 20, and a must also be one of the numbers from 1 to 20, but different from x because x was erased.Therefore, we can write:x = 210 - 19*aSince x must be between 1 and 20, let's find the possible values of 'a' such that x is also in that range.So, let's solve for 'a':x = 210 - 19*aWe need x to be between 1 and 20:1 ≤ 210 - 19*a ≤ 20Let me solve the inequalities:First, 210 - 19*a ≥ 1210 - 19*a ≥ 1Subtract 210 from both sides:-19*a ≥ -209Multiply both sides by (-1), which reverses the inequality:19*a ≤ 209Divide both sides by 19:a ≤ 209 / 19Calculating 209 divided by 19: 19*10 = 190, 209 - 190 = 19, so 10 + 1 = 11. So, a ≤ 11.Second inequality: 210 - 19*a ≤ 20210 - 19*a ≤ 20Subtract 210 from both sides:-19*a ≤ -190Multiply both sides by (-1), reversing the inequality:19*a ≥ 190Divide both sides by 19:a ≥ 10So, combining both inequalities, a must be between 10 and 11, inclusive.But a must be an integer because it's one of the natural numbers from 1 to 20. So, a can be 10 or 11.Therefore, possible values of 'a' are 10 and 11.Let me compute x for each case.Case 1: a = 10x = 210 - 19*10 = 210 - 190 = 20Case 2: a = 11x = 210 - 19*11 = 210 - 209 = 1So, x can be either 20 or 1.Wait, so the erased number could be either 1 or 20. Let me verify this.First, let's check if erasing 20 works.If we erase 20, the remaining numbers are 1 to 19. The sum is 210 - 20 = 190. Now, is there a number 'a' such that a is the arithmetic mean of the other 18 numbers?So, the sum of the other 18 numbers would be 190 - a. The arithmetic mean of these 18 numbers is (190 - a)/18. We need this to be equal to 'a'.So:(190 - a)/18 = aMultiply both sides by 18:190 - a = 18a190 = 19aa = 10Which is indeed one of the numbers in the remaining set (1 to 19). So, 10 is the arithmetic mean of the other 18 numbers. That works.Now, let's check if erasing 1 works.If we erase 1, the remaining numbers are 2 to 20. The sum is 210 - 1 = 209. Now, is there a number 'a' such that a is the arithmetic mean of the other 18 numbers?So, the sum of the other 18 numbers would be 209 - a. The arithmetic mean is (209 - a)/18. We need this equal to 'a':(209 - a)/18 = aMultiply both sides by 18:209 - a = 18a209 = 19aa = 11Which is also in the remaining set (2 to 20). So, 11 is the arithmetic mean of the other 18 numbers. That works too.So, both x = 1 and x = 20 satisfy the condition.Wait, but the problem says \\"find all numbers that could have been erased.\\" So, both 1 and 20 are possible. Is that the only possibilities?Let me think again. We found that a must be 10 or 11, leading to x being 20 or 1. So, yes, only these two numbers.But just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other possibility.Suppose a was 9, then x would be 210 - 19*9 = 210 - 171 = 39. But 39 is not in the original set (which only goes up to 20), so that's invalid.Similarly, if a was 12, x would be 210 - 19*12 = 210 - 228 = -18, which is not a natural number, so that's invalid.Therefore, only a = 10 and a = 11 give valid x within 1 to 20.Hence, the numbers that could have been erased are 1 and 20.Wait, but just to double-check, let me compute the arithmetic mean when x is 20 and a is 10.Sum of remaining numbers: 190Sum of the other 18 numbers: 190 - 10 = 180Arithmetic mean: 180 / 18 = 10, which is correct.Similarly, when x is 1 and a is 11:Sum of remaining numbers: 209Sum of the other 18 numbers: 209 - 11 = 198Arithmetic mean: 198 / 18 = 11, which is correct.So, both cases check out.Therefore, the numbers that could have been erased are 1 and 20.**Final Answer**The numbers that could have been erased are boxed{1} and boxed{20}."},{"question":"What increases the corrosion of metal parts that are in water?a) adding a corrosion inhibitor to the waterb) using rivets made of a more active metal to join the partsc) using rivets made of a less active metal to join the partsd) painting the parts","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options increases the corrosion of metal parts in water. Let's go through each option one by one.First, option a) says adding a corrosion inhibitor to the water. I remember that corrosion inhibitors are supposed to slow down or prevent corrosion. They work by forming a protective layer on the metal or by interfering with the electrochemical reactions that cause corrosion. So adding an inhibitor should decrease corrosion, not increase it. So a) is probably not the right answer.Option b) is using rivets made of a more active metal to join the parts. Hmm, I think this has to do with galvanic corrosion. Galvanic corrosion happens when two different metals are in contact, especially in an electrolyte like water. The more active metal, which is lower on the reactivity series, tends to corrode more because it acts as the anode. So if the rivets are made of a more active metal, they would corrode faster, which could lead to the whole structure being affected. So b) might be the correct answer.Option c) suggests using rivets made of a less active metal. If the rivets are less active, they would be higher on the reactivity series. In a galvanic couple, the less active metal would be the cathode, and the more active metal (the part being riveted) would be the anode. This setup would cause the anode to corrode more. Wait, but if the rivets themselves are less active, does that mean the metal parts would corrode more? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If the rivet is less active, it's more noble, so the metal part would act as the anode and corrode. So using less active rivets would actually increase corrosion on the metal parts. Hmm, so maybe c) is the answer. But I thought b) was about more active, which would also cause corrosion. I need to clarify.Option d) is painting the parts. Painting is a common method to prevent corrosion because it creates a barrier between the metal and the environment. So painting should reduce corrosion, not increase it. So d) is not the answer.Now, going back to options b and c. I think I might have mixed up the terms. The activity series in metals determines which metal is more likely to corrode. A more active metal (lower on the reactivity series) will corrode when in contact with a less active metal. So if the rivets are made of a more active metal, they will corrode, but does that increase the corrosion of the metal parts? Or does it protect them? Wait, no, if the metal parts are the less active ones, and the rivets are more active, then the rivets will corrode, but the metal parts might be protected. Alternatively, if the metal parts are more active, and the rivets are less active, then the metal parts would corrode more.Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall the galvanic series. Metals higher up (more active) will corrode when in contact with metals lower down (less active). So if the metal parts are made of a certain metal, and the rivets are made of a more active metal, then the rivets will corrode, but the metal parts might be protected. Conversely, if the rivets are made of a less active metal, then the metal parts will act as the anode and corrode more.So, if the question is about increasing corrosion of the metal parts, then using rivets made of a less active metal would cause the metal parts to corrode more. Therefore, option c) would increase corrosion. But wait, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check again.Option b) is using more active metal rivets. If the metal parts are less active, then the rivets would corrode, but the parts would be protected. If the metal parts are more active, then the rivets being more active would mean the parts are less active, so the parts would corrode. Wait, I'm getting confused.Alternatively, maybe the key is that when you use a more active metal as a rivet, it acts as a sacrificial anode, protecting the metal parts. So that would decrease corrosion. Whereas using a less active metal would cause the metal parts to corrode more because the parts become the anode.So, putting it all together, option c) using rivets made of a less active metal would increase the corrosion of the metal parts. Therefore, the correct answer is c)."},{"question":"Given that the center of the ellipse (E) is at the origin, its eccentricity is frac{1}{2}, and the right focus of (E) coincides with the focus of the parabola (C: y^2 = 8x), A and B are the points of intersection of the latus rectum of (C) and (E). Find the length of |AB|.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about an ellipse and a parabola. Let me try to understand what it's asking and figure out how to solve it step by step.First, the problem says: \\"Given that the center of the ellipse (E) is at the origin, its eccentricity is 1/2, and the right focus of (E) coincides with the focus of the parabola (C: y² = 8x). A and B are the points of intersection of the latus rectum of (C) and (E). Find the length of |AB|.\\"Alright, so let's break this down.We have an ellipse (E) centered at the origin with eccentricity 1/2. The right focus of this ellipse coincides with the focus of the parabola (C), which is given by y² = 8x. Then, points A and B are where the latus rectum of the parabola (C) intersects the ellipse (E). We need to find the distance between A and B.Let me recall some properties of parabolas and ellipses.Starting with the parabola (C): y² = 8x. I remember that the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is y² = 4px, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Comparing this to our equation y² = 8x, we can see that 4p = 8, so p = 2. Therefore, the focus of the parabola (C) is at (2, 0). That's the right focus of the ellipse (E) as well.So, the ellipse (E) has its center at the origin (0,0), eccentricity e = 1/2, and one of its foci is at (2, 0). Since the center is at the origin, the other focus must be at (-2, 0). But since the problem mentions the right focus, we can focus on (2, 0).Now, for an ellipse, the distance from the center to each focus is given by c, where c = ae, and a is the semi-major axis length. We know that c = 2 (since the focus is at (2,0)), and e = 1/2. So, we can write:c = a * e2 = a * (1/2)So, a = 4.Alright, so the semi-major axis length a is 4. Now, for an ellipse, the relationship between a, b (the semi-minor axis), and c is given by:c² = a² - b²We can plug in the known values:2² = 4² - b²4 = 16 - b²So, b² = 16 - 4 = 12Therefore, b = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3)So, the ellipse (E) has semi-major axis a = 4, semi-minor axis b = 2√3, and is centered at the origin. Since the foci are on the x-axis, the major axis is along the x-axis. So, the standard equation of the ellipse is:(x² / a²) + (y² / b²) = 1Plugging in the values:(x² / 16) + (y² / 12) = 1Okay, so that's the equation of the ellipse.Next, the problem mentions the latus rectum of the parabola (C). I need to recall what the latus rectum is. For a parabola, the latus rectum is the line segment that goes through the focus and is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry, with its endpoints on the parabola. For a parabola that opens to the right, like y² = 4px, the latus rectum is the line x = p, and its endpoints are at (p, 2p) and (p, -2p). So, in our case, since p = 2, the latus rectum is the line x = 2, and its endpoints are at (2, 4) and (2, -4).Wait, let me confirm that. For the parabola y² = 4px, the latus rectum is indeed x = p, and the endpoints are (p, 2p) and (p, -2p). So, for our parabola y² = 8x, which is y² = 4*2x, so p = 2. Therefore, the latus rectum is x = 2, and the endpoints are (2, 4) and (2, -4). So, that's correct.So, the latus rectum of parabola (C) is the vertical line x = 2, from (2, 4) to (2, -4). Now, points A and B are the intersections of this latus rectum with the ellipse (E). So, we need to find where the line x = 2 intersects the ellipse (E). Then, those intersection points are A and B, and we need to find the distance between them.So, let's find the points of intersection between x = 2 and the ellipse (E): (x² / 16) + (y² / 12) = 1.Substituting x = 2 into the ellipse equation:(2² / 16) + (y² / 12) = 1Simplify:(4 / 16) + (y² / 12) = 1Which simplifies to:(1/4) + (y² / 12) = 1Subtract 1/4 from both sides:(y² / 12) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4Multiply both sides by 12:y² = (3/4)*12 = 9Therefore, y = ±3.So, the points of intersection are (2, 3) and (2, -3). Therefore, points A and B are (2, 3) and (2, -3). The distance between A and B is the distance between these two points.Since they have the same x-coordinate, the distance is just the difference in y-coordinates. So, |AB| = |3 - (-3)| = |6| = 6.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.So, the ellipse equation: (x² / 16) + (y² / 12) = 1.At x = 2, plug in:(4 / 16) + (y² / 12) = 11/4 + y² /12 = 1y² /12 = 3/4y² = 9y = ±3Yes, that's correct. So, the points are (2, 3) and (2, -3). The distance between them is 6 units.But wait, let me think again. The latus rectum of the parabola is x = 2, from (2,4) to (2,-4). So, the ellipse intersects this latus rectum at (2,3) and (2,-3). So, the points A and B are (2,3) and (2,-3). So, the distance between them is 6.But just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.Let me re-examine the ellipse equation:(x² / 16) + (y² / 12) = 1At x = 2:(4 / 16) + (y² / 12) = 11/4 + y² /12 = 1Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:3 + y² = 12y² = 9y = ±3Yes, that's correct.So, the points are (2,3) and (2,-3). The distance between these two points is sqrt[(2-2)^2 + (3 - (-3))^2] = sqrt[0 + 36] = 6.Therefore, |AB| = 6.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that these points are indeed on both the ellipse and the latus rectum.For the ellipse: (2²)/16 + (3²)/12 = 4/16 + 9/12 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. Correct.For the parabola's latus rectum: x = 2, which is satisfied by both points. So, yes, they lie on the latus rectum.Therefore, the length is 6.But wait, hold on. The latus rectum of the parabola is x = 2, but the ellipse intersects it at (2,3) and (2,-3). So, the distance between these two points is 6. Hmm, that seems correct.But just to make sure, let me visualize it. The ellipse is centered at the origin, stretching along the x-axis up to (4,0) and (-4,0), and along the y-axis up to (0, 2√3) which is approximately (0, 3.464). The parabola y² = 8x opens to the right, with vertex at the origin and focus at (2,0). Its latus rectum is the line x=2, which is a vertical line passing through the focus, and it intersects the parabola at (2,4) and (2,-4). So, the ellipse, which is wider along the x-axis, will intersect the latus rectum at (2,3) and (2,-3), which are inside the parabola's latus rectum endpoints. So, the distance between these two points is 6.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can sketch a rough graph mentally. The ellipse is longer along the x-axis, with semi-major axis 4 and semi-minor axis about 3.464. The latus rectum of the parabola is at x=2, which is inside the ellipse's major axis. So, the ellipse will intersect this vertical line at two points symmetric about the x-axis, which are (2,3) and (2,-3). So, the distance between them is 6.Therefore, I think the answer is 6.But let me just recap all the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake.1. Found the focus of the parabola y²=8x: since it's y²=4px, so 4p=8, p=2. So, focus at (2,0).2. The ellipse has center at origin, eccentricity e=1/2, and right focus at (2,0). So, c=2, e=1/2, so a= c/e=4.3. Then, using c²=a² - b², so 4=16 - b², so b²=12, b=2√3.4. Equation of ellipse: x²/16 + y²/12 =1.5. Latus rectum of parabola is x=2, endpoints at (2,4) and (2,-4).6. Find intersection of x=2 with ellipse: plug x=2 into ellipse equation.7. Solve for y: y²=9, so y=±3.8. Points A(2,3) and B(2,-3). Distance AB=6.Yes, all steps seem correct.I think I'm confident that the length |AB| is 6.**Final Answer**The length of (|AB|) is boxed{6})."},{"question":"A factory produces four different types of products, labeled as A, B, C, and D, with production quantities of 100, 200, 300, and 400 units respectively. To inspect the quality of the products, a stratified sampling method is used to select 50 units for inspection. The number of units that should be selected from type D products is ______.","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of products produced by the factory. Adding up the quantities of each type gives a total of 100 + 200 + 300 + 400, which equals 1000 units.Next, I'll calculate the proportion of type D products in the total production. Since there are 400 units of type D out of 1000 total units, the proportion is 400 divided by 1000, which simplifies to 0.4.Finally, to find out how many units should be selected from type D for inspection, I'll multiply the total number of units to be inspected (50) by the proportion of type D products (0.4). This results in 50 multiplied by 0.4, which equals 20 units."},{"question":"In the regular tetrahedron (ABCD), take the midpoint (M) on the altitude (AH), and connect (BM) and (CM). Then (angle BMC =)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a regular tetrahedron (ABCD). I need to find the angle (angle BMC) where (M) is the midpoint of the altitude (AH). Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A regular tetrahedron has all edges equal, so every edge is the same length. Let me denote the edge length as (a), but maybe I can assume it's 1 for simplicity? That might make calculations easier.First, I should probably sketch the tetrahedron. Let me label the vertices (A), (B), (C), and (D). Since it's regular, all the faces are equilateral triangles. The altitude (AH) is from vertex (A) to the base face (BCD). The midpoint (M) of this altitude would then be halfway between (A) and the centroid of the base face.Wait, is the centroid of the base face the same as the foot of the altitude? In a regular tetrahedron, yes, because all the medians, altitudes, and centroids coincide. So, (H) is the centroid of triangle (BCD). That means (H) is equidistant from (B), (C), and (D).Now, I need to connect (BM) and (CM). So, points (B), (M), and (C) form triangle (BMC), and I need to find the angle at (M), which is (angle BMC).Hmm, maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices to make this more concrete. Let's place the base triangle (BCD) on the xy-plane for simplicity. Let me choose coordinates such that:- Point (B) is at ((0, 0, 0))- Point (C) is at ((1, 0, 0))- Point (D) is at ((0.5, sqrt{3}/2, 0))This way, triangle (BCD) is an equilateral triangle with side length 1. The centroid (H) of triangle (BCD) can be found by averaging the coordinates of (B), (C), and (D). So,(H_x = (0 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 1.5/3 = 0.5)(H_y = (0 + 0 + sqrt{3}/2)/3 = (sqrt{3}/2)/3 = sqrt{3}/6)(H_z = 0)So, (H) is at ((0.5, sqrt{3}/6, 0)).Now, the altitude (AH) goes from (A) to (H). Since the tetrahedron is regular, the length of the altitude can be calculated. In a regular tetrahedron, the height (h) from a vertex to the base is given by (h = sqrt{frac{2}{3}}). Wait, is that right? Let me recall the formula for the height of a regular tetrahedron with edge length (a). The height (h) is (h = sqrt{frac{2}{3}} a). Since I assumed (a = 1), then (h = sqrt{frac{2}{3}}).So, point (A) is at ((0.5, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{frac{2}{3}})). Let me confirm that. The centroid (H) is at ((0.5, sqrt{3}/6, 0)), so moving up along the z-axis by the height gives (A)'s coordinates.Now, (M) is the midpoint of (AH). So, let me find the coordinates of (M). The midpoint formula is average of the coordinates of (A) and (H).So,(M_x = (0.5 + 0.5)/2 = 0.5)(M_y = (sqrt{3}/6 + sqrt{3}/6)/2 = (sqrt{3}/3)/2 = sqrt{3}/6)(M_z = (sqrt{frac{2}{3}} + 0)/2 = sqrt{frac{2}{3}}/2 = sqrt{frac{2}{3}} times frac{1}{2} = sqrt{frac{2}{3}} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}} = sqrt{frac{2}{3}} times frac{1}{2}). Wait, maybe I should just compute it as (sqrt{2/3}/2 = sqrt{2}/(2sqrt{3}) = sqrt{6}/6). Yeah, that's better.So, (M) is at ((0.5, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/6)).Now, I need to find the angle (angle BMC). To find this angle, I can use vectors. Specifically, I can find the vectors (vec{MB}) and (vec{MC}) and then use the dot product formula to find the angle between them.First, let's find the coordinates of points (B), (M), and (C):- (B) is at ((0, 0, 0))- (M) is at ((0.5, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/6))- (C) is at ((1, 0, 0))So, vector (vec{MB}) is (B - M):(vec{MB} = (0 - 0.5, 0 - sqrt{3}/6, 0 - sqrt{6}/6) = (-0.5, -sqrt{3}/6, -sqrt{6}/6))Similarly, vector (vec{MC}) is (C - M):(vec{MC} = (1 - 0.5, 0 - sqrt{3}/6, 0 - sqrt{6}/6) = (0.5, -sqrt{3}/6, -sqrt{6}/6))Now, to find the angle between (vec{MB}) and (vec{MC}), we can use the dot product formula:(vec{MB} cdot vec{MC} = |vec{MB}| |vec{MC}| cos theta)First, compute the dot product:(vec{MB} cdot vec{MC} = (-0.5)(0.5) + (-sqrt{3}/6)(-sqrt{3}/6) + (-sqrt{6}/6)(-sqrt{6}/6))Let me compute each term:1. ((-0.5)(0.5) = -0.25)2. ((- sqrt{3}/6)(- sqrt{3}/6) = (3/36) = 1/12)3. ((- sqrt{6}/6)(- sqrt{6}/6) = (6/36) = 1/6)Adding them up:(-0.25 + 1/12 + 1/6)Convert to twelfths:(-0.25 = -3/12), (1/12 = 1/12), (1/6 = 2/12)So, total is (-3/12 + 1/12 + 2/12 = 0/12 = 0)Wait, the dot product is zero? That means the vectors are perpendicular, so the angle between them is 90 degrees. So, (angle BMC = 90^circ).But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems surprising.First, the coordinates:- (B = (0,0,0))- (C = (1,0,0))- (M = (0.5, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/6))Vectors:(vec{MB} = (-0.5, -sqrt{3}/6, -sqrt{6}/6))(vec{MC} = (0.5, -sqrt{3}/6, -sqrt{6}/6))Dot product:((-0.5)(0.5) + (-sqrt{3}/6)(-sqrt{3}/6) + (-sqrt{6}/6)(-sqrt{6}/6))Calculates to:(-0.25 + (3/36) + (6/36))Simplify:(-0.25 + 1/12 + 1/6)Convert to twelfths:(-3/12 + 1/12 + 2/12 = 0)Yes, that's correct. So, the dot product is indeed zero, meaning the vectors are perpendicular. Therefore, the angle (angle BMC) is 90 degrees.But just to be thorough, let me compute the magnitudes of (vec{MB}) and (vec{MC}) to ensure they are not zero vectors.Compute (|vec{MB}|):(sqrt{(-0.5)^2 + (-sqrt{3}/6)^2 + (-sqrt{6}/6)^2})Which is:(sqrt{0.25 + (3/36) + (6/36)})Simplify:(sqrt{0.25 + 1/12 + 1/6})Convert to twelfths:(0.25 = 3/12), (1/12 = 1/12), (1/6 = 2/12)Total inside sqrt: (3/12 + 1/12 + 2/12 = 6/12 = 0.5)So, (|vec{MB}| = sqrt{0.5} = sqrt{1/2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2})Similarly, (|vec{MC}|):(sqrt{(0.5)^2 + (-sqrt{3}/6)^2 + (-sqrt{6}/6)^2})Which is the same as (vec{MB}), so it's also (sqrt{0.5} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2})So, both vectors have magnitude (sqrt{2}/2), and their dot product is zero, so the angle between them is indeed 90 degrees.Therefore, (angle BMC = 90^circ).Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in assigning coordinates. Let me verify the coordinates of point (A). In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal. So, the distance from (A) to (B), (A) to (C), and (A) to (D) should all be 1.Let me compute the distance from (A) to (B):(A = (0.5, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/6))(B = (0,0,0))Distance squared:((0.5 - 0)^2 + (sqrt{3}/6 - 0)^2 + (sqrt{6}/6 - 0)^2)Which is:(0.25 + (3/36) + (6/36))Simplify:(0.25 + 1/12 + 1/6)Convert to twelfths:(3/12 + 1/12 + 2/12 = 6/12 = 0.5)So, distance is (sqrt{0.5} = sqrt{2}/2), which is approximately 0.707. But wait, I assumed the edge length is 1, but the distance from (A) to (B) is (sqrt{2}/2). That's not 1. Hmm, did I mess up the coordinates?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the height calculation. Let me recall that in a regular tetrahedron, the height from a vertex to the base is (h = sqrt{frac{2}{3}} a), where (a) is the edge length. So, if I set (a = 1), then (h = sqrt{2/3}). But in my coordinate system, the distance from (A) to (B) is (sqrt{(0.5)^2 + (sqrt{3}/6)^2 + (sqrt{6}/6)^2}), which is (sqrt{0.25 + 1/12 + 1/6}).Wait, 0.25 is 3/12, 1/12 is 1/12, 1/6 is 2/12, so total is 6/12 = 0.5. So, the distance is (sqrt{0.5}), which is (sqrt{2}/2). But if the edge length is supposed to be 1, then my coordinates are incorrect.Hmm, so I must have messed up the coordinates. Let me figure out the correct coordinates for a regular tetrahedron with edge length 1.I think the standard coordinates for a regular tetrahedron can be given as follows:Let me choose the coordinates such that one vertex is at ((0,0,0)), another at ((1,0,0)), the third at ((1/2, sqrt{3}/2, 0)), and the fourth at ((1/2, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/3)). Let me check if this works.So, point (A) is at ((1/2, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/3)), and the base is triangle (BCD) with points (B = (0,0,0)), (C = (1,0,0)), (D = (1/2, sqrt{3}/2, 0)).Let me compute the distance from (A) to (B):Distance squared:((1/2 - 0)^2 + (sqrt{3}/6 - 0)^2 + (sqrt{6}/3 - 0)^2)Which is:(1/4 + (3/36) + (6/9))Simplify:(1/4 + 1/12 + 2/3)Convert to twelfths:(3/12 + 1/12 + 8/12 = 12/12 = 1)So, distance is 1. Perfect, that's correct.Similarly, distance from (A) to (C):((1/2 - 1)^2 + (sqrt{3}/6 - 0)^2 + (sqrt{6}/3 - 0)^2)Which is:(1/4 + 1/12 + 2/3 = same as above = 1). Good.Distance from (A) to (D):((1/2 - 1/2)^2 + (sqrt{3}/6 - sqrt{3}/2)^2 + (sqrt{6}/3 - 0)^2)Compute each term:1. (0)2. ((sqrt{3}/6 - 3sqrt{3}/6)^2 = (-2sqrt{3}/6)^2 = ( - sqrt{3}/3 )^2 = 1/3)3. ((sqrt{6}/3)^2 = 6/9 = 2/3)Total distance squared: (0 + 1/3 + 2/3 = 1). Perfect.So, these coordinates are correct for a regular tetrahedron with edge length 1.So, let me redefine the coordinates:- (A = (1/2, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/3))- (B = (0,0,0))- (C = (1,0,0))- (D = (1/2, sqrt{3}/2, 0))Then, centroid (H) of base (BCD) is the average of (B), (C), and (D):(H_x = (0 + 1 + 1/2)/3 = (3/2)/3 = 1/2)(H_y = (0 + 0 + sqrt{3}/2)/3 = (sqrt{3}/2)/3 = sqrt{3}/6)(H_z = 0)So, (H = (1/2, sqrt{3}/6, 0)), same as before.Altitude (AH) goes from (A = (1/2, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/3)) to (H = (1/2, sqrt{3}/6, 0)). So, the midpoint (M) is halfway between (A) and (H).So, coordinates of (M):(M_x = (1/2 + 1/2)/2 = 1/2)(M_y = (sqrt{3}/6 + sqrt{3}/6)/2 = (sqrt{3}/3)/2 = sqrt{3}/6)(M_z = (sqrt{6}/3 + 0)/2 = sqrt{6}/6)So, (M = (1/2, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/6)). Same as before.So, points:- (B = (0,0,0))- (M = (1/2, sqrt{3}/6, sqrt{6}/6))- (C = (1,0,0))Vectors:(vec{MB} = B - M = (-1/2, -sqrt{3}/6, -sqrt{6}/6))(vec{MC} = C - M = (1/2, -sqrt{3}/6, -sqrt{6}/6))Dot product:(vec{MB} cdot vec{MC} = (-1/2)(1/2) + (-sqrt{3}/6)(-sqrt{3}/6) + (-sqrt{6}/6)(-sqrt{6}/6))Compute each term:1. (-1/2 times 1/2 = -1/4)2. (-sqrt{3}/6 times -sqrt{3}/6 = (3)/36 = 1/12)3. (-sqrt{6}/6 times -sqrt{6}/6 = (6)/36 = 1/6)Total:(-1/4 + 1/12 + 1/6)Convert to twelfths:(-3/12 + 1/12 + 2/12 = 0/12 = 0)So, the dot product is zero. Therefore, the vectors are perpendicular, so the angle between them is 90 degrees.Wait, so even after correcting the coordinates, the result is the same. So, (angle BMC = 90^circ).But just to make sure, let me compute the lengths of (vec{MB}) and (vec{MC}) again with the correct coordinates.Compute (|vec{MB}|):(sqrt{(-1/2)^2 + (-sqrt{3}/6)^2 + (-sqrt{6}/6)^2})Which is:(sqrt{1/4 + 3/36 + 6/36})Simplify:(sqrt{1/4 + 1/12 + 1/6})Convert to twelfths:(3/12 + 1/12 + 2/12 = 6/12 = 1/2)So, (|vec{MB}| = sqrt{1/2} = sqrt{2}/2)Similarly, (|vec{MC}|):(sqrt{(1/2)^2 + (-sqrt{3}/6)^2 + (-sqrt{6}/6)^2})Same as above, so also (sqrt{1/2} = sqrt{2}/2)So, both vectors have magnitude (sqrt{2}/2), and their dot product is zero, so the angle is indeed 90 degrees.Therefore, the answer is (90^circ).But just to think about it geometrically, is there a reason why this angle is 90 degrees? In a regular tetrahedron, the midpoints and centroids have symmetries that might lead to right angles in certain configurations. Maybe because (M) is the midpoint of the altitude, and (B) and (C) are symmetric with respect to the plane through (M) and the centroid (H), leading to the vectors (vec{MB}) and (vec{MC}) being perpendicular.Alternatively, maybe using some properties of regular tetrahedrons and midpoints, but I think the coordinate approach solidifies the conclusion.So, after carefully assigning coordinates, computing vectors, and verifying the dot product, I can confidently say that (angle BMC = 90^circ).**Final Answer**boxed{90^circ}"},{"question":"Compute the value of the expression sqrt{left(frac{9}{16}right)} - (-9.9)^0 + 8^{-frac{2}{3}}.","answer":"First, I need to evaluate each part of the expression separately.Starting with the square root of 9/16, I recognize that the square root of a fraction is the fraction of the square roots. So, √(9/16) equals √9 divided by √16, which simplifies to 3/4.Next, I look at (-9.9) raised to the power of 0. Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so (-9.9)^0 equals 1.Finally, I evaluate 8 raised to the power of -2/3. Negative exponents indicate reciprocals, so 8^(-2/3) is the same as 1 divided by 8^(2/3). The exponent 2/3 means I first take the cube root of 8, which is 2, and then square it, resulting in 4. Therefore, 8^(-2/3) equals 1/4.Now, I can substitute these values back into the original expression:√(9/16) - (-9.9)^0 + 8^(-2/3) becomes 3/4 - 1 + 1/4.Combining the fractions, 3/4 + 1/4 equals 1.

Since 40% of the 140 cows have a red spot, I calculate 40% of 140, which is 56 cows.Next, I find out how many cows do not have a red spot by subtracting the number of cows with a red spot from the total number of cows. This gives me 140 minus 56, resulting in 84 cows without a red spot.Then, I calculate the number of cows with a blue spot. The problem states that 25% of the cows without a red spot have a blue spot. So, 25% of 84 is 21 cows.Finally, to find the number of cows with no spots, I subtract the number of cows with a blue spot from the total number of cows without a red spot.

Let ( B ) represent the amount invested in bonds.Since Billy invested 4.5 times as much in stocks as in bonds, the amount invested in stocks can be expressed as ( 4.5B ).The total investment is the sum of the investments in stocks and bonds, which is ( B + 4.5B = 5.5B ).Given that the total investment is 165,000, I can set up the equation ( 5.5B = 165,000 ).Solving for ( B ), I divide both sides by 5.5 to find ( B = 30,000 ).Finally, to find the total investment in stocks, I multiply ( 4.5 ) by ( B ), resulting in ( 4.5 times 30,000 = 135,000 )."},{"question":"Let m be the largest four-digit number in base-5.

It's defined as all real numbers ( x ) that satisfy the equation ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ). So, I should solve this quadratic equation to find the elements of ( M ).Let me write down the equation again: ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ). Hmm, this looks familiar. I think it's a perfect square. Let me check: ( (x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 ). Yes, that's correct! So, the equation simplifies to ( (x - 1)^2 = 0 ).Now, solving for ( x ), I take the square root of both sides. The square root of ( (x - 1)^2 ) is ( |x - 1| ), and the square root of 0 is 0. So, ( |x - 1| = 0 ). The absolute value of something equals zero only when the something itself is zero. So, ( x - 1 = 0 ), which means ( x = 1 ).Therefore, the set ( M ) has only one element, which is 1. So, ( M = {1} ).Now, the question is asking for the number of subsets of ( M ). I remember that for any set with ( n ) elements, the number of subsets is ( 2^n ). Since ( M ) has 1 element, the number of subsets should be ( 2^1 = 2 ).Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The set ( M ) is defined with a condition ( a in mathbb{R} ). Hmm, that might be a typo or maybe it's supposed to be ( x in mathbb{R} )? Because in the set definition, it's ( x ) that's being quantified, not ( a ). So, perhaps it's a typo, and they meant ( x in mathbb{R} ). If that's the case, then my previous reasoning still holds because the equation only has one real solution, which is 1.Alternatively, if ( a ) is a different variable, maybe it's part of the equation? Let me check the original problem again: \\"The number of subsets of the set ( M = {x | x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0, a in mathbb{R}} ) is ______.\\" Hmm, it's written as ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), with ( a in mathbb{R} ). Maybe ( a ) is a parameter in the equation? But in the equation ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), I don't see an ( a ). So, perhaps the problem is mistyped, and it should be ( x in mathbb{R} ) instead of ( a in mathbb{R} ). Otherwise, ( a ) doesn't play a role here.Assuming it's a typo, and the set is ( M = {x | x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0, x in mathbb{R}} ), then as I found before, ( M ) is just ( {1} ). So, the number of subsets is 2.But just to be thorough, let me consider the other possibility. If ( a ) is indeed part of the equation, maybe the equation is supposed to be ( x^2 - 2a x + 1 = 0 ) or something like that? But the original equation is ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), so unless ( a ) is a coefficient, it's unclear. Since ( a ) isn't in the equation, it's probably a typo.Alternatively, maybe the set is defined as ( M = {x | x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0, a in mathbb{R}} ), meaning that ( a ) is a real number, but ( x ) is still the variable. So, regardless of ( a ), the equation is still ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), which only has one solution, ( x = 1 ). So, ( M ) is still ( {1} ), and the number of subsets is 2.Wait, another thought: maybe ( a ) is a typo for ( x ), so the condition is ( x in mathbb{R} ). That would make sense because otherwise, ( a ) isn't used in the equation. So, yeah, I think it's safe to assume that it's a typo, and the set is ( M = {x | x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0, x in mathbb{R}} ).Therefore, solving ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), we get ( x = 1 ) as the only real solution. So, ( M = {1} ), which has exactly two subsets: the empty set and the set itself. So, the number of subsets is 2.I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me recall that the number of subsets of a set with ( n ) elements is ( 2^n ). Since ( M ) has 1 element, ( 2^1 = 2 ). Yep, that checks out.So, I think I'm confident that the number of subsets is 2.**Final Answer**The number of subsets of the set ( M ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"What is the largest integer less than log_2 frac{2}{1} + log_2 frac{3}{2} + cdots + log_2 frac{2009}{2008} + log_2 frac{2010}{2009}?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest integer less than the sum of a bunch of logarithms. The expression is log base 2 of 2/1 plus log base 2 of 3/2, all the way up to log base 2 of 2010/2009. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when you add logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, log_b a + log_b c = log_b (a*c). So, applying that here, this entire sum should be equal to the logarithm base 2 of the product of all these fractions. Let me write that down:log₂(2/1) + log₂(3/2) + ... + log₂(2010/2009) = log₂[(2/1)*(3/2)*(4/3)*...*(2010/2009)]Okay, so now I have to compute this product inside the logarithm. Let me see if I can simplify this product. It looks like a telescoping product, where each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next fraction.Let me write out the first few terms to see the pattern:(2/1) * (3/2) * (4/3) * (5/4) * ... * (2010/2009)When I multiply these together, the 2 in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the 2 in the denominator of the second fraction. Similarly, the 3 in the numerator of the second fraction cancels with the 3 in the denominator of the third fraction, and so on. This pattern continues all the way through the product.So, what's left after all these cancellations? The first denominator is 1, and the last numerator is 2010. All the intermediate terms cancel out. So, the entire product simplifies to 2010/1, which is just 2010.Therefore, the sum of all those logarithms is log₂(2010). So, the problem reduces to finding the largest integer less than log₂(2010). In other words, I need to find the floor of log₂(2010).Now, I need to figure out what log₂(2010) is approximately. I know that 2^10 is 1024, which is a common value. Let me recall some powers of 2:2^10 = 10242^11 = 20482^12 = 4096So, 2^11 is 2048, which is just a bit larger than 2010. Therefore, log₂(2010) is slightly less than 11. So, the largest integer less than log₂(2010) is 10.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. If 2^11 is 2048, which is more than 2010, then log₂(2010) is indeed less than 11. But is it more than 10? Yes, because 2^10 is 1024, which is much less than 2010. So, log₂(2010) is between 10 and 11, specifically closer to 11.But just to be thorough, maybe I can approximate log₂(2010) more accurately. Let's see.I know that 2^10 = 10242^11 = 2048So, 2010 is between 2^10 and 2^11. Let me calculate how much more 2010 is than 2^10.2010 - 1024 = 986So, 2010 is 986 more than 2^10. Hmm, but that might not help much. Alternatively, I can use logarithm properties or maybe change of base formula to compute log₂(2010).The change of base formula says that log₂(2010) = ln(2010)/ln(2). Alternatively, log₂(2010) = log₁₀(2010)/log₁₀(2). Maybe I can approximate this.I remember that log₁₀(2) is approximately 0.3010.And log₁₀(2010) can be calculated as log₁₀(2.010 * 10^3) = log₁₀(2.010) + 3.I know that log₁₀(2) is approximately 0.3010, so log₁₀(2.010) is a bit more than that. Let me see, 2.010 is 2 + 0.01, so maybe I can approximate log₁₀(2.010) using the derivative.The derivative of log₁₀(x) is 1/(x ln(10)). So, around x=2, the derivative is 1/(2 * ln(10)) ≈ 1/(2 * 2.3026) ≈ 1/4.6052 ≈ 0.217.So, the change in log₁₀(x) when x increases by 0.01 from 2 is approximately 0.217 * 0.01 = 0.00217.Therefore, log₁₀(2.010) ≈ log₁₀(2) + 0.00217 ≈ 0.3010 + 0.00217 ≈ 0.30317.Therefore, log₁₀(2010) ≈ 0.30317 + 3 = 3.30317.Now, log₂(2010) = log₁₀(2010)/log₁₀(2) ≈ 3.30317 / 0.3010 ≈ Let me compute that.3.30317 divided by 0.3010.Well, 0.3010 * 10 = 3.010So, 3.30317 - 3.010 = 0.29317So, 0.29317 / 0.3010 ≈ approximately 0.974.Therefore, log₂(2010) ≈ 10 + 0.974 ≈ 10.974.So, that's approximately 10.974, which is just a bit less than 11. Therefore, the largest integer less than log₂(2010) is 10.Wait, but let me check if my approximation is correct. Maybe I can use another method.Alternatively, I can use natural logarithm.I know that ln(2010) ≈ Let's see, ln(2000) is ln(2*10^3) = ln(2) + 3 ln(10) ≈ 0.6931 + 3*2.3026 ≈ 0.6931 + 6.9078 ≈ 7.6009.But 2010 is 2000 + 10, so ln(2010) ≈ ln(2000) + (10/2000) ≈ 7.6009 + 0.005 ≈ 7.6059. Wait, that's a rough approximation, but maybe let's use a better method.Alternatively, using Taylor series for ln(2010). Let me consider that 2010 = 2000*(1 + 0.005). So, ln(2010) = ln(2000) + ln(1 + 0.005). We know that ln(1 + x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ... for small x.So, ln(1 + 0.005) ≈ 0.005 - (0.005)^2 / 2 + (0.005)^3 / 3 ≈ 0.005 - 0.0000125 + 0.0000000417 ≈ approximately 0.0049875.Therefore, ln(2010) ≈ ln(2000) + 0.0049875 ≈ 7.6009 + 0.0049875 ≈ 7.6058875.Now, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.Therefore, log₂(2010) = ln(2010)/ln(2) ≈ 7.6058875 / 0.6931 ≈ Let's compute that.Dividing 7.6058875 by 0.6931.Well, 0.6931 * 10 = 6.931Subtract that from 7.6058875: 7.6058875 - 6.931 = 0.6748875Now, 0.6931 * 0.974 ≈ 0.6931 * 0.974 ≈ Let me compute 0.6931 * 0.9 = 0.62379, 0.6931 * 0.07 = 0.048517, 0.6931 * 0.004 = 0.0027724. Adding those together: 0.62379 + 0.048517 = 0.672307 + 0.0027724 ≈ 0.6750794.Wait, so 0.6931 * 0.974 ≈ 0.6750794, which is very close to the remaining 0.6748875.So, 0.6748875 / 0.6931 ≈ approximately 0.974.Therefore, log₂(2010) ≈ 10 + 0.974 ≈ 10.974.So, that's consistent with my earlier approximation. Therefore, log₂(2010) is approximately 10.974, which is less than 11, so the floor of that is 10.Therefore, the largest integer less than the given sum is 10.Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can check with another method or see if 2^10.974 is approximately 2010.2^10 = 10242^0.974 ≈ Let's compute that. Since 2^1 = 2, 2^0.974 is slightly less than 2.We can compute 2^0.974 ≈ e^(0.974 * ln 2) ≈ e^(0.974 * 0.6931) ≈ e^(0.675) ≈ approximately 1.964.Therefore, 2^10.974 ≈ 2^10 * 2^0.974 ≈ 1024 * 1.964 ≈ Let's compute 1024 * 2 = 2048, so 1024 * 1.964 is 2048 - (1024 * 0.036) ≈ 2048 - 36.864 ≈ 2011.136.Wait, that's interesting. So, 2^10.974 ≈ 2011.136, which is very close to 2010. So, actually, log₂(2010) is slightly less than 10.974, because 2^10.974 is about 2011.136, which is a bit more than 2010.So, maybe log₂(2010) is approximately 10.974 minus a tiny bit. So, it's approximately 10.973 or something like that.Therefore, the floor of that is still 10.Alternatively, maybe I can use linear approximation between 2^10 and 2^11.We know that 2^10 = 10242^11 = 2048So, the difference between 2^11 and 2^10 is 1024.We have 2010 - 1024 = 986.So, 986 / 1024 ≈ 0.962890625.So, log₂(2010) ≈ 10 + 0.962890625 ≈ 10.962890625.Wait, that's another way to approximate it.But wait, is that correct? Because the function 2^x is exponential, not linear, so the difference isn't linear. So, that approximation might not be accurate.Wait, actually, that method assumes a linear relationship between x and 2^x, which isn't correct. So, that might not be a good way to approximate.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 2^10 = 1024 and 2^11 = 2048, so 2010 is 2048 - 38. So, 2010 is 38 less than 2048. So, 2010 = 2048 - 38.So, log₂(2010) = log₂(2048 - 38) = log₂(2048*(1 - 38/2048)) = log₂(2048) + log₂(1 - 38/2048) = 11 + log₂(1 - 0.0185546875)Now, log₂(1 - x) can be approximated for small x using the Taylor series expansion.We know that log₂(1 - x) ≈ -x / ln(2) - (x^2)/(2*(ln(2))^2) - ... for small x.So, let's compute log₂(1 - 0.0185546875).First, ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.So, log₂(1 - x) ≈ -x / ln(2) - (x^2)/(2*(ln(2))^2)Plugging in x = 0.0185546875:First term: -0.0185546875 / 0.6931 ≈ -0.02677Second term: -(0.0185546875)^2 / (2*(0.6931)^2) ≈ -(0.0003443) / (2*0.4804) ≈ -0.0003443 / 0.9608 ≈ -0.0003585So, total approximation: -0.02677 - 0.0003585 ≈ -0.0271285Therefore, log₂(2010) ≈ 11 - 0.0271285 ≈ 10.9728715So, approximately 10.9729, which is consistent with my earlier approximation.Therefore, log₂(2010) is approximately 10.9729, which is still less than 11, so the floor is 10.Therefore, the largest integer less than the given sum is 10.Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can use another approach.Alternatively, I can note that 2^10 = 1024, 2^11 = 2048.So, 2010 is between 2^10 and 2^11.Compute 2010 / 1024 ≈ 1.962890625So, 2^x = 2010, so x = log₂(2010) = log₂(1024 * 1.962890625) = 10 + log₂(1.962890625)Now, log₂(1.962890625). Let me compute that.We know that 2^1 = 2, so log₂(1.962890625) is slightly less than 1.Compute 2^0.96 ≈ Let's see, 2^0.96 = e^(0.96 * ln 2) ≈ e^(0.96 * 0.6931) ≈ e^(0.6653) ≈ 1.943.Hmm, 1.943 is less than 1.962890625.Compute 2^0.97 ≈ e^(0.97 * 0.6931) ≈ e^(0.6723) ≈ 1.957.Still less than 1.962890625.Compute 2^0.975 ≈ e^(0.975 * 0.6931) ≈ e^(0.6763) ≈ 1.967.That's a bit more than 1.962890625.So, 2^0.975 ≈ 1.967, which is more than 1.962890625.So, the exponent x such that 2^x = 1.962890625 is between 0.97 and 0.975.Let me use linear approximation.Let’s denote f(x) = 2^x.We have f(0.97) ≈ 1.957f(0.975) ≈ 1.967We need to find x such that f(x) = 1.962890625.Compute the difference between 1.962890625 and 1.957: 1.962890625 - 1.957 ≈ 0.005890625The total difference between f(0.975) and f(0.97) is 1.967 - 1.957 = 0.01So, the fraction is 0.005890625 / 0.01 ≈ 0.5890625Therefore, x ≈ 0.97 + 0.5890625*(0.975 - 0.97) ≈ 0.97 + 0.5890625*0.005 ≈ 0.97 + 0.0029453125 ≈ 0.9729453125So, log₂(1.962890625) ≈ 0.9729453125Therefore, log₂(2010) ≈ 10 + 0.9729453125 ≈ 10.9729453125So, approximately 10.9729, which is consistent with previous calculations.Therefore, the floor of log₂(2010) is 10.Therefore, the largest integer less than the given sum is 10.I think that's thorough enough. I've checked it multiple ways: telescoping product, change of base formula, natural logarithms, linear approximations, and even using the Taylor series for logarithms. All methods point to log₂(2010) being approximately 10.97, which is less than 11, so the floor is 10.**Final Answer**The largest integer less than the given sum is boxed{10}."},{"question":"Let i be the imaginary unit. If the equation x^2-(2+i)x+1+mi=0 (m in mathbb{R}) has a real root n, then m= ________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: ( x^2 - (2 + i)x + 1 + mi = 0 ), where ( m ) is a real number. The problem says that this equation has a real root ( n ), and I need to find the value of ( m ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, since ( n ) is a real root, it means that when I plug ( n ) into the equation, the equation should hold true. So, substituting ( x = n ) into the equation, I get:( n^2 - (2 + i)n + 1 + mi = 0 ).Now, let me break this down. Since ( n ) is real, all the terms involving ( n ) will be real except for the terms with ( i ). So, I can separate the equation into its real and imaginary parts. That should help me solve for ( m ).Let me write out the equation again:( n^2 - 2n - in + 1 + mi = 0 ).Now, grouping the real and imaginary parts:Real part: ( n^2 - 2n + 1 ).Imaginary part: ( -n + m ).Since the equation equals zero, both the real and imaginary parts must individually equal zero. Otherwise, we'd have a complex number, which can't be zero unless both parts are zero. So, I can set up two separate equations:1. ( n^2 - 2n + 1 = 0 ) (Real part)2. ( -n + m = 0 ) (Imaginary part)Alright, let's solve the first equation for ( n ). The equation is a quadratic:( n^2 - 2n + 1 = 0 ).I recognize this as a perfect square trinomial. It factors to:( (n - 1)^2 = 0 ).So, the solution is ( n = 1 ). That means the real root is 1.Now, moving on to the second equation:( -n + m = 0 ).We already found that ( n = 1 ), so substituting that in:( -1 + m = 0 ).Solving for ( m ):( m = 1 ).Wait, let me double-check that. If ( n = 1 ), plugging back into the original equation:( (1)^2 - (2 + i)(1) + 1 + m i = 0 ).Calculating each term:1. ( 1^2 = 1 )2. ( -(2 + i)(1) = -2 - i )3. ( 1 + mi )Adding them all together:( 1 - 2 - i + 1 + mi = (1 - 2 + 1) + (-i + mi) = 0 + (m - 1)i ).For this to equal zero, the imaginary part must be zero:( (m - 1)i = 0 ).Since ( i ) is not zero, ( m - 1 = 0 ), so ( m = 1 ). Yep, that checks out.Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:1. I substituted ( x = n ) into the equation.2. Separated the equation into real and imaginary parts.3. Solved the real part equation to find ( n = 1 ).4. Plugged ( n = 1 ) into the imaginary part equation to find ( m = 1 ).5. Verified by plugging ( n = 1 ) and ( m = 1 ) back into the original equation to ensure it equals zero.Everything seems consistent. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident that ( m = 1 ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( m ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Each point on a plane is colored in one of three colors, with all three colors being used. Is it true that for any such coloring, one can select a circle that contains points of all three colors?","answer":"Okay, so I came across this interesting problem today. It goes like this: Each point on a plane is colored in one of three colors, and all three colors are used. The question is, is it true that for any such coloring, one can select a circle that contains points of all three colors? Hmm, that's intriguing. Let me try to wrap my head around it.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have the entire plane, and every single point on it is colored either color A, B, or C. Importantly, all three colors are used somewhere on the plane. The question is whether, no matter how you do this coloring, there will always be some circle—any circle, of any radius, centered anywhere—that includes points of all three colors within it. So, the circle can be as big or as small as needed, and it can be placed anywhere on the plane. The key is that within that circle, you must have at least one point of each color.Alright, so I need to figure out if this is always true. Let me think about how I might approach this. Maybe I can start by considering some simpler cases or similar problems. I remember something about the chromatic number of the plane, which is the minimum number of colors needed to color the plane such that no two points at distance 1 from each other are the same color. That's a famous problem, but I don't know if it's directly related here. Maybe not, but perhaps some concepts from it can help.Alternatively, maybe I can think about this in terms of density or distribution of colors. If all three colors are used, they must be spread out in some way across the plane. But how? The plane is infinite, so it's possible that one color is used only in a bounded region, while the others are spread out infinitely. Or maybe all three are spread out infinitely. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about the distribution of colors, just that all three are used. So, the coloring could be arbitrary. That means I can't assume anything about how the colors are arranged—whether they're in regions, scattered randomly, or something else.Let me consider the contrapositive: if every circle on the plane contains at most two colors, then it's impossible to have all three colors used. But I don't know if that's helpful. Maybe I should think about specific examples or try to construct a coloring where every circle only has two colors, but that seems difficult because the plane is so vast.Alternatively, maybe I can use some topological arguments or measure theory. But I'm not too familiar with those areas, so I might need to think of a more elementary approach.Let me try to visualize it. Suppose I have three colors: red, green, and blue. All three are used somewhere on the plane. Now, I need to find a circle that contains at least one red, one green, and one blue point. How can I ensure that such a circle exists?Maybe I can fix a point of each color and then try to find a circle that includes all three. But the problem is that the points could be arbitrarily far apart, right? So, if I have one red point, one green point, and one blue point, each in different parts of the plane, maybe I can make a circle big enough to include all three. But wait, the circle can be as large as needed, so in theory, I can always make a circle that includes any three given points. But the problem is, the circle has to contain points of all three colors, not necessarily specific points.Wait, but if I can always make a circle that includes any three points, then perhaps I can choose three points, one of each color, and then create a circle around them. But hold on, the circle is determined first, and then we check if it contains all three colors. So, I can't choose the points after choosing the circle.Hmm, that complicates things. So, the circle is fixed, and then within that circle, we must have all three colors. So, the challenge is to find a circle such that inside it, there's at least one point of each color.Let me think about this differently. Suppose I pick a point of color red. Then, I can draw a circle around it. Depending on the radius, this circle might include other colors. But how do I ensure that within some radius, there are points of green and blue?Wait, but the plane is densely colored with all three colors. So, around any red point, there must be green and blue points nearby? Is that necessarily true? Not necessarily. It's possible that in some regions, only two colors are used, and the third color is used elsewhere. So, maybe near a red point, there are only red and green, but no blue. Similarly, near a green point, maybe only green and blue, but no red. So, in that case, a circle around a red point might not contain blue, and a circle around a green point might not contain red.But the problem states that all three colors are used somewhere on the plane. So, if I can find a region where all three colors are present, then I can make a circle around that region. But how can I guarantee that such a region exists?Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the plane is connected. If all three colors are used, then their regions must overlap in some way. But again, I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. If I consider a large enough circle, it must contain points of all three colors because the plane is entirely colored. But is that necessarily true?Wait, no. Because the plane is infinite, it's possible that one color is used only in a bounded region, and the other two colors are used everywhere else. So, if I make a circle that's entirely within the bounded region of the first color, it might only contain that color. But if I make a circle that's outside that region, it might contain the other two colors. But the problem is that all three colors are used, so the bounded region must exist somewhere.Wait, but the circle can be placed anywhere. So, if one color is only used in a bounded region, say a disk of radius R centered at some point, then I can make a circle that includes that disk and some surrounding area. That surrounding area would contain the other two colors, so the circle would contain all three colors.But hold on, if the bounded region is, say, a single point, then a circle around that point with an infinitesimal radius would only contain that color. But the problem states that all three colors are used, so there must be at least one point of each color. But if one color is only used at a single point, then any circle containing that point would have that color, but maybe not the others.Wait, but the other two colors are used everywhere else, right? So, if I make a circle around that single point, as long as the radius is greater than zero, it will include points from the other two colors as well. Because the other colors are used everywhere else on the plane. So, in that case, the circle would contain all three colors.But is that necessarily the case? Suppose one color is used only at a single point, and the other two colors are used everywhere else. Then, any circle with radius greater than zero around that single point would contain points of the other two colors, so the circle would have all three colors. Similarly, if a color is used in a bounded region, say a disk, then a circle that includes that disk and extends beyond it would contain all three colors.But what if a color is used in multiple disconnected regions? For example, color red is used in two separate disks far apart from each other, and colors green and blue are used everywhere else. Then, a circle that includes one red disk would contain red and the other two colors, but a circle that doesn't include any red disks might only contain green and blue. But wait, the problem states that all three colors are used, so if red is used in two separate disks, then those disks are part of the plane, so somewhere else on the plane, green and blue are used. So, if I make a circle that includes one red disk, it would contain red, green, and blue. But if I make a circle that doesn't include any red disks, it might only contain green and blue. But the problem is asking if there exists at least one circle that contains all three colors, not that every circle does. So, in this case, such a circle exists—just include one of the red disks and some surrounding area.Wait, but what if a color is used in such a way that it's only in regions that are too far apart? For example, red is used at two points that are very far apart, and green and blue are used everywhere else. Then, a circle that includes one red point would contain red, green, and blue, but a circle that includes the other red point would also contain red, green, and blue. However, a circle that doesn't include either red point would only contain green and blue. But again, the problem is just asking if there exists at least one circle that contains all three colors, so such circles do exist.Hmm, so maybe the answer is yes, it's always possible to find such a circle. But I need to make sure there isn't a way to color the plane with three colors such that no circle contains all three colors.Let me try to think of a counterexample. Suppose I color the plane in such a way that red is used only on the x-axis, green is used only on the y-axis, and blue is used everywhere else. Then, any circle that intersects both the x-axis and y-axis would contain red and green, but would it contain blue? Well, if the circle is centered at the origin with radius greater than zero, it would intersect both axes and also contain points from blue. So, that circle would have all three colors.Alternatively, if I color the plane such that red is used in the first quadrant, green in the second, and blue in the third and fourth. Then, a circle that covers all four quadrants would contain all three colors. But wait, in this case, the fourth quadrant is blue, so a circle covering all four quadrants would include red, green, and blue.Wait, maybe another approach. Suppose I color the plane such that red is used only on the set of points with integer coordinates, green is used only on points with half-integer coordinates, and blue is used everywhere else. Then, any circle that contains at least one integer coordinate point, one half-integer coordinate point, and some other point would contain all three colors. But is that necessarily the case? If I make a circle that's very small, say with radius less than 0.25, centered between four integer grid points, then it might not contain any integer or half-integer points, so it would only contain blue. But the problem states that all three colors are used, so in this case, the circle can be chosen to be larger, so that it includes points of all three colors.Wait, but the problem is asking if for any coloring, there exists at least one circle that contains all three colors. So, even if some circles only contain two colors, as long as there's at least one circle that contains all three, it's okay. So, in my previous example, even though small circles might only contain blue, larger circles would contain red, green, and blue.But is there a way to color the plane such that no circle contains all three colors? That is, every circle contains at most two colors. If such a coloring exists, then the answer to the problem would be no. Otherwise, if every coloring must have at least one circle with all three colors, then the answer is yes.So, can I construct a three-coloring of the plane where every circle contains at most two colors? Let me think.Suppose I partition the plane into three regions, each colored with one color, such that no circle can intersect all three regions. Is that possible? For example, if I color the plane such that each color is confined to a half-plane, but arranged in a way that any circle can only intersect two half-planes. But wait, a circle can intersect multiple half-planes. For example, if I divide the plane into three sectors like a pie chart, each sector colored differently, then a circle that's large enough can intersect all three sectors, thus containing all three colors.Alternatively, if I color the plane such that each color is confined to a strip, say, horizontal strips. For example, red between y=0 and y=1, green between y=1 and y=2, and blue everywhere else. Then, a circle that spans from below y=0 to above y=2 would contain all three colors. But if I make the strips infinitely thin, say, red at y=0, green at y=1, and blue elsewhere, then a circle that includes both y=0 and y=1 would contain red and green, but would it contain blue? Well, yes, because blue is everywhere else, so any circle that includes points above y=1 or below y=0 would contain blue as well. So, such a circle would have all three colors.Hmm, maybe another approach. What if I color the plane such that each color is used only on lines or curves that don't allow a circle to intersect all three? For example, red on the x-axis, green on the y-axis, and blue everywhere else. Then, a circle that intersects both axes would contain red and green, but would it contain blue? Yes, because blue is everywhere else, so any circle that isn't entirely on the axes would contain blue. So, such a circle would have all three colors.Wait, maybe if I color the plane such that each color is used only on a single point. But the problem states that all three colors are used, so each color must be used at least once. But if each color is only used at a single point, then any circle containing all three points would have all three colors. But if the three points are colinear and far apart, can I make a circle that contains all three? Yes, by making a circle large enough to include all three points.But wait, if the three points are not colinear, then a circle can pass through all three, but that's a different concept. The circle doesn't need to pass through the points, just contain them within its interior. So, even if the three points are far apart, a sufficiently large circle can contain all three.But in this case, the rest of the plane is colored with... Wait, no, in this case, if each color is only used at a single point, then the rest of the plane is not colored? No, the problem states that every point is colored, so all three colors must be used, but they can be used sparsely. So, if I have three points, each colored differently, and the rest of the plane colored with, say, red. Then, a circle that includes all three points would contain red, green, and blue. But a circle that doesn't include the green and blue points would only contain red. But the problem is asking if there exists at least one circle that contains all three colors, so in this case, such a circle exists.Wait, but in this case, the rest of the plane is colored red, so any circle that includes the green and blue points would contain red as well, because the rest of the plane is red. So, yes, such a circle exists.Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it in terms of density. Since the plane is densely colored with all three colors, any sufficiently large circle must contain points of all three colors. But is that necessarily true?Wait, no. Because it's possible that one color is used only in a bounded region, and the other two colors are used everywhere else. So, a circle that includes the bounded region would contain all three colors, but a circle that doesn't include the bounded region would only contain the other two colors. But again, the problem is just asking if there exists at least one circle that contains all three colors, so such a circle does exist.Wait, but what if two colors are used in bounded regions, and the third color is used everywhere else? Then, a circle that includes both bounded regions would contain all three colors, but a circle that doesn't include them would only contain the third color. But again, the problem is just asking if there's at least one circle that contains all three colors, so such a circle exists.Alternatively, if all three colors are used in bounded regions, then a sufficiently large circle can include all three regions, thus containing all three colors.Wait, but what if the bounded regions are arranged in such a way that no single circle can include all three? For example, if each color is used in a separate, far-apart bounded region. Then, a circle can be made large enough to include all three regions, right? Because the plane is infinite, but any finite number of bounded regions can be enclosed in a sufficiently large circle.But wait, the regions could be infinitely far apart? No, because the plane is a single connected space, and any bounded region is, well, bounded. So, if you have three bounded regions, each can be enclosed in a circle, and then a larger circle can enclose all three.Wait, but if the regions are not bounded, but rather, each color is used in an unbounded region, but arranged in a way that a circle can't intersect all three. For example, red is used in the right half-plane, green in the left half-plane, and blue in the upper half-plane. Then, a circle that's in the lower half-plane would only contain red and green, but not blue. But a circle that's in the upper half-plane would contain blue and either red or green, depending on the side. But a circle that spans both upper and lower half-planes and both left and right half-planes would contain all three colors.Wait, but in this case, the blue is only in the upper half-plane, red in the right, green in the left. So, a circle that's in the upper half-plane and spans both left and right would contain blue, red, and green. So, such a circle exists.Alternatively, if I color the plane such that red is used in the first quadrant, green in the second, blue in the third, and red again in the fourth. Then, a circle that covers all four quadrants would contain red, green, and blue. So, such a circle exists.Hmm, it seems like no matter how I try to color the plane with three colors, as long as all three are used, there will always be a circle that contains all three colors. Because either the colors are spread out in such a way that a sufficiently large circle can capture all three, or they're arranged in regions that can be enclosed within a single circle.Wait, but what if one color is used only at a single point, and the other two colors are used in such a way that they don't overlap? For example, red at the origin, green in the upper half-plane, and blue in the lower half-plane. Then, a circle around the origin with a small radius would only contain red. A circle in the upper half-plane would contain green and red (if it includes the origin) or just green. Similarly, a circle in the lower half-plane would contain blue and red (if it includes the origin) or just blue. But a circle that includes the origin and extends into both the upper and lower half-planes would contain red, green, and blue. So, such a circle exists.Alternatively, if red is only at the origin, green is everywhere except the origin and the lower half-plane, and blue is everywhere except the origin and the upper half-plane. Then, a circle that includes the origin and parts of both upper and lower half-planes would contain red, green, and blue. So, such a circle exists.Wait, but what if the other two colors are arranged such that they don't overlap? For example, green is used in the upper half-plane, and blue is used in the lower half-plane, with red only at the origin. Then, a circle that includes the origin and parts of both upper and lower half-planes would contain red, green, and blue. So, such a circle exists.Alternatively, if green is used only in the upper half-plane and blue only in the lower half-plane, with red used only at the origin, then a circle that includes the origin and parts of both half-planes would contain all three colors. So, such a circle exists.Wait, but what if green is used only on the x-axis, blue only on the y-axis, and red only at the origin. Then, a circle that includes the origin and parts of both axes would contain red, green, and blue. So, such a circle exists.Hmm, it seems like no matter how I try to arrange the colors, as long as all three are used somewhere on the plane, I can always find a circle that contains all three colors. Because if one color is used sparsely, the other two are used more densely, and a sufficiently large circle can capture the sparse color along with the others.Alternatively, if all three colors are used densely, then any circle would contain all three colors. But even if one color is used sparsely, as long as it's used somewhere, a circle can be made to include that point along with regions of the other two colors.Wait, but what if one color is used only on a set of measure zero, like a countable set of points, and the other two colors are used everywhere else. Then, any circle that includes one of those points would contain that color and the other two colors as well, since the other two colors are used everywhere else. So, such a circle exists.Alternatively, if one color is used on a line, and the other two colors are used everywhere else. Then, a circle that intersects the line would contain that color and the other two colors as well.Wait, but what if all three colors are used on lines that are arranged such that no circle can intersect all three? For example, red on the x-axis, green on the y-axis, and blue on the line y = x. Then, a circle that intersects all three lines would contain all three colors. But is that possible? Yes, a circle can intersect all three lines if it's large enough and placed appropriately.Wait, but actually, any circle that's not centered at the origin and has a radius large enough can intersect all three lines. For example, a circle centered at (1,1) with a large radius would intersect the x-axis, y-axis, and y = x line. So, such a circle would contain all three colors.Alternatively, if the three lines are parallel, say, horizontal lines y=0, y=1, y=2. Then, a circle that spans from below y=0 to above y=2 would intersect all three lines, thus containing all three colors.Hmm, it seems like in every case I try to think of, as long as all three colors are used somewhere on the plane, there exists a circle that contains all three colors. Because either the colors are spread out enough that a large circle can capture them, or they're arranged in such a way that a circle can be placed to include points of all three colors.Wait, but what if one color is used only at a single point, and the other two colors are used in such a way that they don't overlap? For example, red at the origin, green in the upper half-plane, and blue in the lower half-plane. Then, a circle that includes the origin and parts of both upper and lower half-planes would contain red, green, and blue. So, such a circle exists.Alternatively, if red is only at the origin, green is used in the right half-plane, and blue in the left half-plane. Then, a circle that includes the origin and parts of both left and right half-planes would contain all three colors.Wait, but what if the other two colors are used in such a way that they don't overlap with each other or with the third color? For example, red is used in the first quadrant, green in the second, and blue in the third and fourth. Then, a circle that covers all four quadrants would contain all three colors.Alternatively, if red is used in the first quadrant, green in the third, and blue in the second and fourth. Then, a circle that covers all four quadrants would contain all three colors.Wait, but what if the three colors are used in such a way that each is confined to a separate quadrant, and no circle can cover all three? For example, red in quadrant I, green in quadrant II, and blue in quadrant III. Then, a circle that covers quadrants I, II, and III would contain all three colors. But is that possible? Yes, by making a circle large enough to include all three quadrants.Alternatively, if each color is used in a separate quadrant, but arranged such that no single circle can cover all three. Wait, but quadrants are adjacent, so a circle can easily cover multiple quadrants. For example, a circle centered at the origin with a radius large enough would cover all four quadrants, thus containing all three colors.Wait, but in this case, blue is only in quadrant III, so the circle would contain red, green, and blue.Hmm, I'm starting to think that it's impossible to color the plane with three colors without having some circle that contains all three colors. Because no matter how you arrange the colors, as long as all three are used, you can always find a circle that includes points of all three.But let me try to think of a more pathological coloring. Suppose I color the plane such that red is used only on the set of points with both coordinates rational, green on points with both coordinates irrational, and blue on points where one coordinate is rational and the other is irrational. Then, any circle would contain points of all three colors because it would include points with both rational and irrational coordinates. So, such a circle exists.Alternatively, if I color the plane based on some fractal pattern, like a Sierpiński carpet, but using three colors. Then, any sufficiently large circle would intersect all three colors.Wait, but even if the coloring is very sparse, as long as all three colors are used somewhere, a circle can be made to include those points. For example, if red is used at (0,0), green at (1,0), and blue at (0,1), then a circle centered at (0.5, 0.5) with radius sqrt(0.5) would contain all three points, thus containing all three colors.Alternatively, if the three points are very far apart, say, red at (0,0), green at (1000,0), and blue at (0,1000), then a circle centered at (500,500) with radius 707.1 (approximately) would contain all three points.Wait, but what if the three points are arranged such that no circle can contain all three? For example, if they're colinear and spaced infinitely apart. But in reality, points on a plane can't be infinitely far apart; they can be arbitrarily far, but any finite distance can be enclosed in a circle. So, even if the three points are very far apart, a sufficiently large circle can contain all three.Wait, but in reality, on the plane, any three points can be enclosed in a circle, unless they're colinear and the circle is required to pass through them, but in this case, the circle just needs to contain them within its interior. So, yes, any three points can be enclosed in a circle.Therefore, if all three colors are used at least once, then there exist points of each color, and a circle can be drawn to include all three points, thus containing all three colors.Wait, but what if a color is used only on a set of measure zero, like a single point, and the other two colors are used everywhere else. Then, any circle that includes that single point would contain that color and the other two colors as well, since the other two colors are used everywhere else. So, such a circle exists.Alternatively, if a color is used on a line, and the other two colors are used everywhere else, then a circle that intersects the line would contain that color and the other two colors as well.Wait, but what if a color is used on a set that's nowhere dense, like the Cantor set. Then, a circle can still be made to include points from the Cantor set along with points from the other two colors.Hmm, it seems like no matter how sparse or dense the colors are, as long as all three are used somewhere on the plane, there exists a circle that contains all three colors.Therefore, I'm starting to lean towards the answer being yes, it's always true that such a circle exists.But let me try to think of a more formal argument. Maybe using the fact that the plane is connected and the colors are used everywhere.Wait, but the colors don't have to be connected. They can be scattered in any way. But regardless, as long as each color is used at least once, we can find points of each color, and then find a circle that contains all three points.Wait, but that's assuming that the points are such that a circle can contain them. But in reality, any three points can be enclosed in a circle, unless they're colinear and the circle is required to pass through them, but in this case, the circle just needs to contain them within its interior.Wait, actually, any three non-colinear points can be enclosed in a circle, but colinear points can also be enclosed in a circle, just not necessarily passing through them. So, yes, any three points can be enclosed in a circle.Therefore, if all three colors are used, meaning there exist at least one point of each color, then we can find a circle that contains all three points, thus containing all three colors.Wait, but the problem says \\"each point on a plane is colored,\\" so it's not just three points, but every point. So, the circle must contain points of all three colors, not just specific points.But if all three colors are used, then there are points of each color. So, if I can find a circle that contains at least one point of each color, then that circle satisfies the condition.But how do I ensure that such a circle exists? Because the colors could be arranged in such a way that any circle I choose might miss one color.Wait, but if all three colors are used, then for any two points of different colors, there must be a third point of the third color somewhere on the plane. So, if I choose a circle that includes those three points, it would contain all three colors.But again, the problem is that the circle is fixed, and then we check if it contains all three colors. So, I can't choose the points after choosing the circle.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the plane is a Baire space, and the sets of each color are dense or something. But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the plane is separable, meaning it has a countable dense subset. So, if I have a countable dense subset, then any circle around a point in that subset with a radius that includes other points in the subset would contain points of all colors.But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.Wait, maybe I can think about it in terms of the plane being a union of circles. Since any point can be the center of a circle, and any radius can be chosen, perhaps for any three points, I can find a circle that contains all three.But again, I'm going in circles (pun intended).Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that if all three colors are used, then their complements are not the entire plane. So, for each color, the set of points not of that color is not the whole plane. Therefore, the intersection of the complements of two colors is not the whole plane, meaning there exists at least one point of the third color. But I'm not sure how that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the plane is connected and the sets of each color are closed or open. But the problem doesn't specify anything about the sets being open or closed.Wait, but even if the color sets are arbitrary, as long as they're non-empty, we can find a circle that intersects all three.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the plane is a normal space, and apply some separation axiom. But I'm not too familiar with that.Alternatively, maybe I can use measure theory. If all three colors are used, then each color has a positive measure, and thus, their intersection with any sufficiently large circle would have positive measure. But I'm not sure if that's necessarily true.Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about the measure or density of the colors. So, maybe that's not the right approach.Wait, going back to the beginning, the problem is whether for any three-coloring of the plane, with all three colors used, there exists a circle containing all three colors. From my earlier reasoning, it seems that such a circle must exist because you can always find points of each color and enclose them in a circle. But I need to make sure that this is always possible, regardless of how the colors are arranged.Wait, but what if one color is used only on a set that's somehow \\"hidden\\" from circles? For example, if red is used only on points that are all inside some other shape, but I don't think that's possible because the plane is unbounded.Wait, no, because if red is used somewhere, then a circle can be made to include that point, and since the other two colors are used everywhere else, the circle would contain all three colors.Wait, but if red is used only at a single point, and the other two colors are used everywhere else, then any circle that includes that single point would contain red and the other two colors. So, such a circle exists.Alternatively, if red is used only on a line, and the other two colors are used everywhere else, then a circle that intersects the line would contain red and the other two colors.Wait, but what if the other two colors are arranged such that they don't overlap with red? For example, red on the x-axis, green above the x-axis, and blue below the x-axis. Then, a circle that intersects the x-axis and extends above and below would contain red, green, and blue.Alternatively, if red is on the x-axis, green on the y-axis, and blue elsewhere, then a circle that intersects both axes would contain red, green, and blue.Wait, but in all these cases, such a circle exists. So, maybe the answer is yes, it's always possible.But I need to make sure that there isn't a way to color the plane such that no circle contains all three colors. From all the examples I've considered, it seems impossible. Every time, such a circle exists.Therefore, I think the answer is yes, it's true that for any such coloring, one can select a circle that contains points of all three colors.**Final Answer**boxed{Yes}"},{"question":"In a rectangle where OA is a side and OB is a diagonal, overrightarrow {OA}=(-3,1), overrightarrow {OB}=(-2,k), then the real number k= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle where OA is a side and OB is a diagonal. They give me the vectors OA and OB, and I need to find the real number k. Let me try to visualize this first.So, OA is a side of the rectangle, which means it's one of the sides, and OB is a diagonal. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and they bisect each other. Also, the sides are perpendicular to each other. Hmm, so maybe I can use some properties of vectors here.Given:- Vector OA = (-3, 1)- Vector OB = (-2, k)I need to find k. Let me think about how vectors OA and OB relate in the rectangle.Since OA is a side and OB is a diagonal, the diagonal OB can be expressed as the sum of two adjacent sides. In a rectangle, the diagonal vector is the sum of the two adjacent side vectors. So, if OA is one side, the other side can be found by subtracting OA from OB.Wait, let me clarify. If OA is a side, then the other side can be found by vector addition. Let me denote the other side as vector OC. So, in the rectangle OABC, OA and OC are adjacent sides, and OB is the diagonal from O to B. So, OB = OA + OC.Therefore, OC = OB - OA.Let me compute that:OC = OB - OA = (-2, k) - (-3, 1) = (-2 + 3, k - 1) = (1, k - 1)So, vector OC is (1, k - 1). Now, in a rectangle, the sides OA and OC should be perpendicular to each other because all angles in a rectangle are right angles. Therefore, the dot product of OA and OC should be zero.Let me write that down:OA · OC = 0Substituting the vectors:(-3, 1) · (1, k - 1) = 0Calculating the dot product:(-3)(1) + (1)(k - 1) = 0Simplify:-3 + k - 1 = 0Combine like terms:k - 4 = 0So, solving for k:k = 4Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my reasoning.First, I assumed that OB is the diagonal, so OB = OA + OC. Then, since OA and OC are sides of the rectangle, they should be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. That led me to k = 4.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the properties of rectangles and vectors?Alternatively, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length. So, the length of OB should be equal to the length of the other diagonal. But wait, in this case, OB is given as a diagonal, but we don't have the other diagonal. Hmm, maybe that's not directly helpful.Alternatively, since OA is a side and OB is a diagonal, the vector OB can be expressed as OA plus another vector which is perpendicular to OA. So, if I can find a vector perpendicular to OA, that might help.A vector perpendicular to OA = (-3, 1) would have a direction such that their dot product is zero. So, if I have a vector (a, b) perpendicular to (-3, 1), then:(-3)(a) + (1)(b) = 0 => -3a + b = 0 => b = 3aSo, any vector of the form (a, 3a) is perpendicular to OA.Therefore, the other side vector OC can be written as (a, 3a). Then, since OB is the diagonal, OB = OA + OC.So, let's compute that:OB = OA + OC = (-3, 1) + (a, 3a) = (-3 + a, 1 + 3a)But we know OB is given as (-2, k). Therefore:-3 + a = -21 + 3a = kFrom the first equation:-3 + a = -2 => a = -2 + 3 => a = 1Substituting a = 1 into the second equation:1 + 3(1) = k => 1 + 3 = k => k = 4So, same result. That seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular, so the vectors OA and OC must satisfy OA · OC = 0, which is what I did earlier.So, both methods lead me to k = 4. That gives me more confidence that this is the correct answer.Just to recap:1. Recognize that in a rectangle, the diagonal is the sum of two adjacent sides.2. Express the unknown side vector as the difference between the diagonal and the known side vector.3. Use the property that adjacent sides are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.4. Solve for k.Alternatively, express the unknown side as a vector perpendicular to the known side, then add to get the diagonal, and solve for k.Either way, k comes out to 4.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The real number ( k ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"A van is delivering  180 bottles of drinks to a neighborhood, and each bottle contains either cider or beer or a mixture of two.

The equation given is:1/(2!17!) + 1/(3!16!) + 1/(4!15!) + 1/(5!14!) + 1/(6!13!) + 1/(7!12!) + 1/(8!11!) + 1/(9!10!) = N/(1!18!)Hmm, okay. So, I need to find N first and then compute N divided by 100 and take the floor of that. Let me see how to approach this.Looking at the left side, it's a sum of reciprocals of products of factorials. Each term has two factorials multiplying each other, and the numbers in the factorials add up to 19 each time. For example, 2!17! is 2 + 17 = 19, 3!16! is 3 + 16 = 19, and so on until 9!10! which is 9 + 10 = 19.So, each term is 1/(k!(19 - k)!) where k ranges from 2 to 9. That seems like a pattern. Maybe I can relate this to combinations or binomial coefficients?I remember that the binomial coefficient C(n, k) is equal to n!/(k!(n - k)!). So, if I have 1/(k!(19 - k)!), that's similar to 1/(19! * C(19, k)). Because C(19, k) = 19!/(k!(19 - k)!), so 1/(k!(19 - k)!) = C(19, k)/19!.So, each term on the left side can be rewritten as C(19, k)/19! where k goes from 2 to 9. Therefore, the entire sum is equal to [C(19,2) + C(19,3) + ... + C(19,9)] / 19!.So, the left side is [sum from k=2 to 9 of C(19, k)] / 19!.And the right side is N/(1!18!) which is N/(18!).So, setting them equal:[sum from k=2 to 9 of C(19, k)] / 19! = N / 18!I can multiply both sides by 19! to get:sum from k=2 to 9 of C(19, k) = N * 19! / 18! = N * 19.So, N = [sum from k=2 to 9 of C(19, k)] / 19.Therefore, N is equal to the sum of combinations from k=2 to 9 of 19 choose k, divided by 19.Hmm, okay. So, I need to compute sum from k=2 to 9 of C(19, k), then divide by 19 to get N.But computing each term individually might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute this sum.I remember that the sum of all binomial coefficients for a given n is 2^n. So, sum from k=0 to 19 of C(19, k) = 2^19.But we need the sum from k=2 to 9. So, that would be 2^19 minus the terms from k=0 to 1 and from k=10 to 19.But wait, since C(n, k) = C(n, n - k), so the sum from k=10 to 19 is the same as the sum from k=0 to 9. Wait, no, actually, it's symmetric around k=9.5, so C(19,10) = C(19,9), C(19,11)=C(19,8), etc.Therefore, the sum from k=10 to 19 is equal to the sum from k=0 to 9. So, if I subtract the sum from k=0 to 9, I get the sum from k=10 to 19.But in our case, we need sum from k=2 to 9. So, that would be sum from k=0 to 9 minus sum from k=0 to 1.Similarly, the sum from k=0 to 19 is 2^19, so sum from k=0 to 9 is (2^19)/2 = 2^18, because of the symmetry.Wait, is that correct? Let me think.Actually, for n even, the sum from k=0 to n/2 is equal to 2^(n-1). But for n odd, like 19, it's a bit different. Wait, n=19 is odd, so the middle term is at k=9.5, which doesn't exist, so the sum from k=0 to 9 is equal to the sum from k=10 to 19. So, each of these sums is equal to 2^18.Because 2^19 is the total sum, so each half is 2^18.So, sum from k=0 to 9 of C(19, k) = 2^18.Similarly, sum from k=10 to 19 of C(19, k) = 2^18.Therefore, sum from k=2 to 9 is equal to sum from k=0 to 9 minus sum from k=0 to 1.Sum from k=0 to 1 is C(19,0) + C(19,1) = 1 + 19 = 20.Therefore, sum from k=2 to 9 is 2^18 - 20.So, going back, N = (2^18 - 20)/19.Let me compute that.First, 2^10 is 1024, so 2^18 is (2^10)^2 * 2^(-2) = 1024^2 / 4. Wait, actually, 2^18 is 262144.Wait, let me compute 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048, 2^12=4096, 2^13=8192, 2^14=16384, 2^15=32768, 2^16=65536, 2^17=131072, 2^18=262144.Yes, so 2^18 is 262,144.So, 2^18 - 20 = 262,144 - 20 = 262,124.Therefore, N = 262,124 / 19.Now, let's compute 262,124 divided by 19.First, let's see how many times 19 goes into 262,124.Alternatively, 19 * 13,000 = 247,000.Subtracting that from 262,124: 262,124 - 247,000 = 15,124.Now, 19 * 800 = 15,200. Hmm, that's a bit more than 15,124.So, 19 * 796 = ?Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 262,124 ÷ 19.Let me do the division step by step.19 into 262,124.First, 19 into 262. 19*13=247, 19*14=266 which is too big. So, 13. 262 - 247 = 15.Bring down the 1: 151.19 into 151: 19*7=133, 19*8=152 which is too big. So, 7. 151 - 133 = 18.Bring down the 2: 182.19 into 182: 19*9=171, 19*10=190 too big. So, 9. 182 - 171 = 11.Bring down the 4: 114.19 into 114: 19*6=114. So, 6. 114 - 114 = 0.So, putting it all together: 13,796.Wait, let me check:19 * 13,796.Compute 19 * 13,796.First, 10,000 * 19 = 190,000.3,000 * 19 = 57,000.700 * 19 = 13,300.90 * 19 = 1,710.6 * 19 = 114.Adding them up:190,000 + 57,000 = 247,000247,000 + 13,300 = 260,300260,300 + 1,710 = 262,010262,010 + 114 = 262,124.Yes, that's correct. So, N = 13,796.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the division.Wait, 19 * 13,796 is indeed 262,124. So, N is 13,796.Therefore, N = 13,796.Now, the problem asks for the greatest integer less than N/100.So, N/100 = 13,796 / 100 = 137.96.The greatest integer less than 137.96 is 137.So, the answer is 137.Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning.First, I recognized that each term on the left side can be expressed as C(19, k)/19! for k from 2 to 9.Then, I summed those up, which gave me [sum from k=2 to 9 of C(19, k)] / 19! = N / 18!.Multiplying both sides by 19! gives sum from k=2 to 9 of C(19, k) = N * 19.Then, I computed the sum from k=2 to 9 of C(19, k) as 2^18 - 20, which is 262,124.Divided by 19 gives N = 13,796.Then, N / 100 is 137.96, so the greatest integer less than that is 137.Yes, that seems correct.I think my steps are solid. I converted each term into a binomial coefficient, recognized the symmetry in the binomial coefficients to compute the sum efficiently, and then performed the division correctly. So, I feel confident that the answer is 137.**Final Answer**boxed{137}"},{"question":"Unit vectors bar{e}_{1}, bar{e}_{2}, bar{e}_{3} satisfy the condition bar{e}_{1}+bar{e}_{2}+bar{e}_{3}=overline{0}. Find bar{e}_{1} bar{e}_{2}+bar{e}_{2} bar{e}_{3}+bar{e}_{3} bar{e}_{1}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are three unit vectors, let's call them e₁, e₂, and e₃. They satisfy the condition that when you add them all together, you get the zero vector. So, e₁ + e₂ + e₃ = 0. The question is asking me to find the value of e₁·e₂ + e₂·e₃ + e₃·e₁. Hmm, okay, that seems like a vector dot product problem.First, I remember that the dot product of two unit vectors is equal to the cosine of the angle between them. So, if I can find the angles between each pair of vectors, I can compute each dot product and then add them up. But I don't know the angles directly, so maybe there's another way.Since the sum of the vectors is zero, that means these vectors form a triangle when placed tip-to-tail. So, if I imagine each vector as a side of a triangle, they must form a closed loop. That makes me think of the properties of vectors in a triangle.I also recall that if the sum of vectors is zero, then the square of the sum is also zero. So, maybe I can square both sides of the equation e₁ + e₂ + e₃ = 0 and see what happens.Let me write that down:(e₁ + e₂ + e₃) · (e₁ + e₂ + e₃) = 0 · 0 = 0.Expanding the left side using the distributive property of dot products:e₁·e₁ + e₁·e₂ + e₁·e₃ + e₂·e₁ + e₂·e₂ + e₂·e₃ + e₃·e₁ + e₃·e₂ + e₃·e₃ = 0.Now, since the dot product is commutative, e₁·e₂ = e₂·e₁, and so on. So, I can group the terms:(e₁·e₁ + e₂·e₂ + e₃·e₃) + 2(e₁·e₂ + e₁·e₃ + e₂·e₃) = 0.I know that each vector is a unit vector, so e₁·e₁ = 1, e₂·e₂ = 1, and e₃·e₃ = 1. Therefore, the first group of terms is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.So, plugging that back in:3 + 2(e₁·e₂ + e₁·e₃ + e₂·e₃) = 0.Let me denote S = e₁·e₂ + e₁·e₃ + e₂·e₃. Then the equation becomes:3 + 2S = 0.Solving for S:2S = -3S = -3/2.So, the value of e₁·e₂ + e₁·e₃ + e₂·e₃ is -3/2.Wait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the sum of vectors being zero, squaring both sides gives the sum of the squares plus twice the sum of the dot products. Since each vector is a unit vector, their squares are 1, so 3 + 2S = 0. That seems right. So, S must be -3/2.I think that's the answer. It makes sense because if the vectors are arranged in a triangle, each pair forms an angle of 120 degrees, and the cosine of 120 degrees is -1/2. So, each dot product is -1/2, and there are three such terms, so 3*(-1/2) = -3/2. That matches my result.Yeah, I think that's correct.**Final Answer**The value of bar{e}_{1} cdot bar{e}_{2} + bar{e}_{2} cdot bar{e}_{3} + bar{e}_{3} cdot bar{e}_{1} is boxed{-dfrac{3}{2}}."},{"question":"Sara goes to a bookstore and wants to buy a book that is originally priced at 100.Which of the following options gives her the best discounted price?(A) A discount of 20%(B) A discount of 10%, then a discount of 10% off the new price(C) A discount of 15%, then a discount of 5% off the new price(D) A discount of 5%, then a discount of 15% off the new price(E) All four options above give the same price","answer":"First, I need to calculate the final price for each of the given discount options based on the original price of 100.For Option A, a single 20% discount is applied to the original price.

The first discount reduces the price by 10%, so the price becomes 90. The second 10% discount is applied to the new price of 90, resulting in a further reduction of 9.

The problem says that this is a linear equation in terms of (x). Hmm, okay. So, if it's linear, that means the highest power of (x) should be 1, right? That means the coefficient of (x^2) must be zero. So, I need to set the coefficient of (x^2) equal to zero and solve for (m).Let me write that down. The coefficient of (x^2) is (m^2 - 1). So, setting that equal to zero:(m^2 - 1 = 0)Hmm, solving for (m), I can factor this as a difference of squares:((m - 1)(m + 1) = 0)So, either (m - 1 = 0) or (m + 1 = 0), which gives (m = 1) or (m = -1).But wait, hold on. If (m = 1), let me check the original equation. If (m = 1), then the equation becomes:((1^2 - 1)x^2 - (1 - 1)x - 8 = 0)Simplifying that:((1 - 1)x^2 - (0)x - 8 = 0)Which is:(0x^2 - 0x - 8 = 0)That simplifies to (-8 = 0), which is not possible. So, (m = 1) is not a valid solution because it leads to an invalid equation. Therefore, the only valid solution is (m = -1).Okay, so (m = -1). Now, with that value of (m), the original equation becomes a linear equation. Let me substitute (m = -1) into the original equation:(((-1)^2 - 1)x^2 - (-1 - 1)x - 8 = 0)Calculating each term:((-1)^2 is 1, so 1 - 1 = 0. So, the coefficient of (x^2) is 0, as expected.Next term: (-(-1 - 1)). Let's compute inside the parentheses first: (-1 - 1 = -2). So, the term becomes (-(-2)x), which is (2x).So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:(0x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0)Simplifying, that's:(2x - 8 = 0)Solving for (x), add 8 to both sides:(2x = 8)Divide both sides by 2:(x = 4)So, now we have (x = 4) and (m = -1). The problem asks for the value of (200(x - m)(x + 2m) - 10m). Let me compute that step by step.First, compute (x - m):(x - m = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5)Next, compute (x + 2m):(x + 2m = 4 + 2(-1) = 4 - 2 = 2)Now, multiply these two results:((x - m)(x + 2m) = 5 times 2 = 10)Multiply this by 200:(200 times 10 = 2000)Now, compute (-10m):(-10m = -10(-1) = 10)Finally, add these two results together:(2000 + 10 = 2010)So, the value of (200(x - m)(x + 2m) - 10m) is 2010.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, (x = 4), (m = -1).

The operation ( oplus ) is defined for any real numbers ( x, y, z ) with two properties:1. ( x oplus 0 = 1 ) for any real number ( x ).2. ( (x oplus y) oplus z = (z oplus xy) + z ) for any real numbers ( x, y, z ).Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out what ( 1 oplus 2004 ) is. Let me start by trying to understand the operation ( oplus ) better. Maybe I can find a general formula for ( x oplus y ).First, let's look at the first property: ( x oplus 0 = 1 ). That seems straightforward. No matter what ( x ) is, if we ( oplus ) it with 0, we get 1.Now, the second property is more complex: ( (x oplus y) oplus z = (z oplus xy) + z ). This looks like an associative-like property but not exactly the same because of the ( + z ) at the end. Maybe I can manipulate this equation to find a relationship or even a formula for ( x oplus y ).Let me try plugging in some specific values to see if I can find a pattern or deduce a formula. Let's start by setting ( z = 0 ) in the second property. That might simplify things because of the first property.So, if ( z = 0 ), the equation becomes:( (x oplus y) oplus 0 = (0 oplus xy) + 0 ).Using the first property, ( (x oplus y) oplus 0 = 1 ) and ( 0 oplus xy = 1 ). So, substituting these in:( 1 = 1 + 0 ).Well, that simplifies to ( 1 = 1 ), which is always true but doesn't give me new information. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.What if I set ( x = 0 ) in the second property? Let me try that.Setting ( x = 0 ), the equation becomes:( (0 oplus y) oplus z = (z oplus 0 cdot y) + z ).Simplify ( 0 cdot y ) to 0:( (0 oplus y) oplus z = (z oplus 0) + z ).From the first property, ( z oplus 0 = 1 ), so:( (0 oplus y) oplus z = 1 + z ).But what is ( 0 oplus y )? Let me denote ( 0 oplus y ) as some expression. Let's say ( 0 oplus y = f(y) ). Then the equation becomes:( f(y) oplus z = 1 + z ).Hmm, interesting. So, ( f(y) oplus z = 1 + z ) for any ( z ). Let me see if I can find ( f(y) ).If I set ( z = 0 ) in this equation, we get:( f(y) oplus 0 = 1 + 0 ).Which simplifies to:( f(y) = 1 ).Wait, so ( f(y) = 1 ) for any ( y ). That means ( 0 oplus y = 1 ) for any ( y ). So, regardless of what ( y ) is, ( 0 oplus y = 1 ). That's an important piece of information.So, going back to the equation ( f(y) oplus z = 1 + z ), since ( f(y) = 1 ), we have:( 1 oplus z = 1 + z ).So, ( 1 oplus z = 1 + z ). That's a useful result. So, whenever the left operand is 1, the operation ( oplus ) is just addition by 1.Wait, so ( 1 oplus z = 1 + z ). That might help me compute ( 1 oplus 2004 ) directly? Let me check.If ( 1 oplus z = 1 + z ), then substituting ( z = 2004 ), we get:( 1 oplus 2004 = 1 + 2004 = 2005 ).So, is ( c = 2005 )? That seems straightforward, but let me verify if this holds with the given properties.Wait, maybe I should check if my deduction that ( 1 oplus z = 1 + z ) is consistent with the original properties.Let me test it with the second property. Let's take ( x = 1 ), ( y = a ), and ( z = b ). Then, according to the second property:( (1 oplus a) oplus b = (b oplus (1 cdot a)) + b ).Simplify ( 1 cdot a ) to ( a ):( (1 oplus a) oplus b = (b oplus a) + b ).From my earlier deduction, ( 1 oplus a = 1 + a ). So, substituting that in:( (1 + a) oplus b = (b oplus a) + b ).But I don't know what ( (1 + a) oplus b ) is yet. Maybe I can express it in terms of ( oplus ). Wait, if ( 1 oplus z = 1 + z ), perhaps ( x oplus z ) is something like ( x + z ) or another function. Let me see.Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for ( x oplus y ). Let me assume that ( x oplus y ) is of the form ( f(x) + g(y) ) or something similar. But maybe that's too restrictive.Alternatively, let's see if I can express ( x oplus y ) in terms of known operations. Let me try to find ( x oplus y ) by using the given properties.Let me set ( z = 1 ) in the second property:( (x oplus y) oplus 1 = (1 oplus (x y)) + 1 ).From my earlier result, ( 1 oplus (x y) = 1 + x y ). So, substituting that in:( (x oplus y) oplus 1 = (1 + x y) + 1 = x y + 2 ).But also, from the same earlier result, ( (x oplus y) oplus 1 = (x oplus y) + 1 ). Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Because ( 1 oplus z = 1 + z ), but ( (x oplus y) oplus 1 ) would be ( (x oplus y) + 1 ) only if ( x oplus y = 1 ). But that's not necessarily the case.Wait, no. Let me clarify. If ( a oplus 1 = a + 1 ), then ( (x oplus y) oplus 1 = (x oplus y) + 1 ). So, yes, that's correct.So, putting it together:( (x oplus y) + 1 = x y + 2 ).Therefore, subtracting 1 from both sides:( x oplus y = x y + 1 ).Wait, so ( x oplus y = x y + 1 ). Is that possible? Let me check if this satisfies the given properties.First, check property (i): ( x oplus 0 = x cdot 0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 ). That works.Now, check property (ii): ( (x oplus y) oplus z = (z oplus (x y)) + z ).Compute left side: ( (x oplus y) oplus z = (x y + 1) oplus z = (x y + 1) z + 1 = x y z + z + 1 ).Compute right side: ( (z oplus (x y)) + z = (z cdot (x y) + 1) + z = x y z + 1 + z ).So, both sides are equal: ( x y z + z + 1 ). Therefore, the formula ( x oplus y = x y + 1 ) satisfies both properties.Great! So, now that I have the general formula for ( x oplus y ), I can compute ( 1 oplus 2004 ).Using the formula:( 1 oplus 2004 = 1 cdot 2004 + 1 = 2004 + 1 = 2005 ).So, ( c = 2005 ).But just to be thorough, let me verify this with another example. Let's take ( x = 2 ), ( y = 3 ), and ( z = 4 ).Compute ( (2 oplus 3) oplus 4 ):First, ( 2 oplus 3 = 2 cdot 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 ).Then, ( 7 oplus 4 = 7 cdot 4 + 1 = 28 + 1 = 29 ).Now, compute ( (4 oplus (2 cdot 3)) + 4 ):First, ( 2 cdot 3 = 6 ).Then, ( 4 oplus 6 = 4 cdot 6 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 ).Then, ( 25 + 4 = 29 ).So, both sides equal 29. That checks out.Another test: ( x = 0 ), ( y = 5 ), ( z = 6 ).Compute ( (0 oplus 5) oplus 6 ):First, ( 0 oplus 5 = 0 cdot 5 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 ).Then, ( 1 oplus 6 = 1 cdot 6 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 ).Now, compute ( (6 oplus (0 cdot 5)) + 6 ):First, ( 0 cdot 5 = 0 ).Then, ( 6 oplus 0 = 6 cdot 0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 ).Then, ( 1 + 6 = 7 ).Again, both sides equal 7. Perfect.So, the formula ( x oplus y = x y + 1 ) seems consistent with both properties. Therefore, using this formula, ( 1 oplus 2004 = 1 times 2004 + 1 = 2005 ).I think that's solid. So, ( c = 2005 ).**Final Answer**The value of ( c ) is boxed{2005}."},{"question":"How many positive integers are factors of 2012?(A) 2  (B) 3  (C) 7  (D) 6  (E) 8","answer":"To determine the number of positive integer factors of 2012, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.First, I divide 2012 by 2, which gives 1006.

How many inequivalent color schemes are possible?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a 7x7 checkerboard where two squares are painted yellow and the rest are green. I need to figure out how many inequivalent color schemes there are, considering that two colorings are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by rotating the board. Hmm, okay, so it's a problem about counting distinct colorings under rotation.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a 7x7 grid, which means there are 49 squares in total. Two of these are painted yellow, and the rest are green. Now, two colorings are considered the same (equivalent) if one can be rotated to look like the other. So, I need to count the number of distinct colorings considering these rotations.I remember that when dealing with counting problems under group actions like rotations, Burnside's lemma is a useful tool. Burnside's lemma states that the number of inequivalent configurations is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group actions. In simpler terms, I need to consider all possible rotations (the group) and count how many colorings remain unchanged (fixed) under each rotation, then take the average.So, the group here consists of rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. That's four rotations in total. For each of these rotations, I need to calculate the number of colorings that are fixed by that rotation.Let me break it down step by step.1. **Total number of colorings without considering equivalence:**   Since we're choosing 2 squares out of 49 to paint yellow, the total number of colorings is C(49,2). Let me compute that:   C(49,2) = 49*48/2 = 1176.2. **Applying Burnside's lemma:**   The number of inequivalent colorings is equal to (F0 + F90 + F180 + F270)/4, where Fθ is the number of colorings fixed by a rotation of θ degrees.   So, I need to compute F0, F90, F180, and F270.3. **Calculating F0:**   F0 is the number of colorings fixed by a 0° rotation, which is essentially doing nothing. So, all colorings are fixed by this rotation. Therefore, F0 = total number of colorings = 1176.4. **Calculating F180:**   Now, F180 is the number of colorings fixed by a 180° rotation. For a coloring to be fixed under 180° rotation, each yellow square must be mapped to another yellow square when the board is rotated 180°.    So, let's think about the 7x7 grid. When you rotate it 180°, each square is mapped to another square. If a square is in the center, it maps to itself. For other squares, they form pairs: each square and its 180° counterpart.   Since the grid is 7x7, the center square is unique, and the other squares form pairs. So, how many such pairs are there?   Total squares: 49. Subtract the center square: 48. So, 48/2 = 24 pairs.   So, in order for a coloring to be fixed under 180° rotation, either:   - Both squares in a pair are yellow, or   - Neither are yellow.   But since we're only painting two squares yellow, let's see how this works.   Each pair can contribute 0 or 2 yellow squares. Since we need exactly two yellow squares, the only way this can happen is if exactly one of these pairs is chosen to have both squares yellow. Alternatively, if one of the squares is the center square, but wait, the center square is fixed under 180° rotation, so if the center square is yellow, then the other yellow square must also be fixed under 180°, which is only possible if it's the center square itself. But since we can only have two yellow squares, if one is the center, the other must be another square, but that other square must map to itself under 180°, which only the center does. So, that's not possible because we can't have two center squares.   Therefore, the center square cannot be one of the yellow squares because if it is, the other yellow square would have to be its 180° counterpart, which is itself, but that would require both yellow squares to be the center, which is not allowed since we have only one center square.   So, all two yellow squares must come from the 24 pairs. Each pair contributes two squares. So, to get exactly two yellow squares, we need to choose exactly one pair out of the 24 pairs, and paint both squares in that pair yellow.   Therefore, the number of such colorings is 24.   Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.   If I choose one pair, that gives me two yellow squares. Since each pair is distinct, choosing different pairs gives different colorings. So, yes, 24 colorings fixed under 180° rotation.   Alternatively, if the two yellow squares are each other's 180° counterparts, which is exactly what choosing a pair does. So, yes, 24.5. **Calculating F90 and F270:**   Now, this is more complicated. Let's tackle F90 first.   F90 is the number of colorings fixed under a 90° rotation. Similarly, F270 is the number fixed under a 270° rotation. Since 270° is just the inverse of 90°, the number of fixed colorings should be the same for both. So, F90 = F270.   So, let's compute F90.   For a coloring to be fixed under a 90° rotation, each yellow square must be mapped to another yellow square upon rotation. Since 90° rotation cycles four squares at a time (except for the center square, which maps to itself), the yellow squares must form cycles of four squares each, or be the center square.   However, since we have only two yellow squares, let's see how this can happen.   If the two yellow squares are part of a 4-cycle, then each 4-cycle would require four yellow squares, but we only have two. So, that's not possible. Alternatively, if one of the yellow squares is the center, then the other yellow square must be mapped to itself under 90° rotation, which only the center does. But we can't have two center squares, so that's not possible either.   Alternatively, maybe the two yellow squares are in positions that are each other's images under 90° rotation. But wait, 90° rotation has cycles of four. So, unless the two yellow squares are in positions that are two steps apart in the cycle, but that would require four squares, not two.   Wait, perhaps it's impossible to have a coloring fixed under 90° rotation with exactly two yellow squares.   Let me think more carefully.   The 7x7 grid has a center square, and the other squares are arranged in orbits under rotation. Each orbit consists of four squares, except for the center square, which is alone.   So, the total number of orbits under 90° rotation is (49 - 1)/4 = 12 orbits of four squares each, plus the center square. So, 12 + 1 = 13 orbits.   Now, for a coloring to be fixed under 90° rotation, the color of each square must be the same as the color of all squares in its orbit. Since we're dealing with two yellow squares, the orbits can contribute 0, 4, or 1 yellow squares (if the orbit is the center square). But since we have only two yellow squares, which is not a multiple of 4, the only way this can happen is if two orbits contribute one yellow square each, but that's not possible because each orbit contributes 0 or 4 yellow squares.   Wait, no, actually, if an orbit is entirely yellow, it contributes 4 yellow squares. If it's not, it contributes 0. The center square contributes 1 if it's yellow.   So, to have exactly two yellow squares, we have two possibilities:   - The center square is yellow, and one other orbit is entirely yellow. But that would give 1 + 4 = 5 yellow squares, which is more than two.   - Alternatively, two orbits are each contributing 1 yellow square, but each orbit must contribute 0 or 4. So, we can't have 1 yellow square from an orbit.   Therefore, it's impossible to have exactly two yellow squares fixed under a 90° rotation. So, F90 = 0.   Similarly, F270 = 0.   Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.   Suppose we have two yellow squares. For the coloring to be fixed under 90° rotation, every time you rotate the board 90°, the yellow squares must map to yellow squares. So, if a square is yellow, then all squares in its orbit must be yellow. Since each orbit has four squares (except the center), you can't have just two yellow squares unless you have half an orbit, which isn't possible.   So, yes, F90 = F270 = 0.6. **Putting it all together:**   So, we have:   - F0 = 1176   - F90 = 0   - F180 = 24   - F270 = 0   Therefore, the total number of inequivalent colorings is (1176 + 0 + 24 + 0)/4 = (1200)/4 = 300.   Wait, 1176 + 24 is 1200? Let me check that: 1176 + 24 is indeed 1200. Then 1200 divided by 4 is 300. So, 300 inequivalent colorings.   Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me think again if I missed something.   Specifically, when calculating F180, I considered that the two yellow squares must form a pair under 180° rotation. So, each such pair is unique, and there are 24 such pairs, leading to 24 colorings fixed under 180°. That seems correct.   For F90 and F270, I concluded that it's impossible to have exactly two yellow squares fixed under these rotations because each orbit contributes 4 squares, and we can't have a partial orbit. So, F90 and F270 are zero. That seems correct.   Therefore, the total number is 300.   Wait, but let me think about another approach to verify.   Alternatively, I could compute the number of orbits using Burnside's lemma as I did, but maybe I can also think about it as counting the number of distinct pairs under rotation.   The total number of pairs is 1176. The group acting on them has four elements: rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. So, the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points, which is exactly what Burnside's lemma says.   So, I think my calculation is correct.   Alternatively, maybe I can think about the number of distinct pairs considering rotations.   But considering that, for two squares, their positions can either be in the same orbit or not. But that might complicate things.   Alternatively, maybe I can think about the number of unordered pairs of squares, considering rotational symmetry.   But I think the Burnside's lemma approach is solid here.   So, in conclusion, the number of inequivalent color schemes is 300.**Final Answer**boxed{300}"},{"question":"Troye and Daniella are running at constant speeds in opposite directions around a circular track. Troye completes one lap every 56 seconds and meets Daniella every 24 seconds. How many seconds does it take Daniella to complete one lap?(A) 32(B) 36(C) 40(D) 48(E) 42","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Troye and Daniella are running around a circular track, but in opposite directions. They both run at constant speeds. The problem says that Troye completes one lap every 56 seconds, and they meet each other every 24 seconds. I need to figure out how long it takes Daniella to complete one lap. The options are 32, 36, 40, 48, or 42 seconds. Hmm, let's break this down.First, let me visualize the situation. There's a circular track, and Troye is running in one direction, say clockwise, while Daniella is running counterclockwise. They start somewhere, and every 24 seconds, they meet each other. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. That makes sense because when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is additive.So, let me denote the length of the track as ( L ). I don't know the actual length, but since it's a circular track, the distance each runner covers is a multiple of ( L ) depending on how many laps they complete.Troye completes one lap in 56 seconds, so his speed ( v_T ) is ( frac{L}{56} ) per second. Similarly, Daniella's speed ( v_D ) would be ( frac{L}{t} ) per second, where ( t ) is the time we need to find for her to complete one lap.Since they're moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is ( v_T + v_D ). When they meet each other, together they would have covered a distance equal to the circumference of the track, which is ( L ). So, the time between their meetings is the time it takes for them to cover ( L ) together at their combined speed.The formula for time is distance divided by speed. So, the time between meetings is ( frac{L}{v_T + v_D} ). According to the problem, this time is 24 seconds. So, I can set up the equation:( frac{L}{v_T + v_D} = 24 )Substituting the expressions for ( v_T ) and ( v_D ):( frac{L}{frac{L}{56} + frac{L}{t}} = 24 )Hmm, let me simplify this equation. First, notice that ( L ) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it should cancel out. Let me write that:( frac{1}{frac{1}{56} + frac{1}{t}} = 24 )That simplifies things. So, now I have:( frac{1}{frac{1}{56} + frac{1}{t}} = 24 )Let me denote ( frac{1}{56} + frac{1}{t} ) as ( S ), so ( frac{1}{S} = 24 ), which means ( S = frac{1}{24} ).So, ( frac{1}{56} + frac{1}{t} = frac{1}{24} )Now, I can solve for ( frac{1}{t} ):( frac{1}{t} = frac{1}{24} - frac{1}{56} )To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 24 and 56 is... let's see, 24 factors into 2^3 * 3, and 56 factors into 2^3 * 7. So, the LCM would be 2^3 * 3 * 7, which is 8 * 3 * 7 = 168. So, 168 is the common denominator.Converting both fractions:( frac{1}{24} = frac{7}{168} ) because 24 * 7 = 168.( frac{1}{56} = frac{3}{168} ) because 56 * 3 = 168.So, subtracting:( frac{7}{168} - frac{3}{168} = frac{4}{168} )Simplify ( frac{4}{168} ): divide numerator and denominator by 4, which gives ( frac{1}{42} ).So, ( frac{1}{t} = frac{1}{42} ), which means ( t = 42 ) seconds.Wait, but hold on, 42 is one of the options, option (E). But let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with relative speeds, it's easy to make a mistake.Let me go through the steps again.1. Troye's speed is ( frac{L}{56} ) per second.2. Daniella's speed is ( frac{L}{t} ) per second.3. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is ( frac{L}{56} + frac{L}{t} ).4. The time between meetings is the time it takes for them to cover the track length ( L ) together, so ( frac{L}{frac{L}{56} + frac{L}{t}} = 24 ).5. Simplify: ( frac{1}{frac{1}{56} + frac{1}{t}} = 24 ).6. Which leads to ( frac{1}{56} + frac{1}{t} = frac{1}{24} ).7. Subtract ( frac{1}{56} ) from both sides: ( frac{1}{t} = frac{1}{24} - frac{1}{56} ).8. Convert to common denominator: 168.9. ( frac{7}{168} - frac{3}{168} = frac{4}{168} = frac{1}{42} ).10. So, ( t = 42 ) seconds.Hmm, that seems correct. So, Daniella takes 42 seconds to complete one lap. But wait, let me think about this again because 42 is not the middle option, it's one of the higher ones. Is that reasonable?If Troye is taking 56 seconds per lap, and they meet every 24 seconds, which is less than half of 56, so Daniella must be faster than Troye? Wait, no, because they're moving towards each other, so their relative speed is adding, so if they meet every 24 seconds, that could mean that Daniella is actually faster or slower?Wait, no, actually, if they're moving towards each other, the time between meetings depends on the sum of their speeds. So, if Troye is slower, Daniella could be faster or slower, but the meeting time is 24 seconds, which is less than Troye's lap time. So, that suggests that together, they cover the track pretty quickly.Wait, let me think about the speeds. If Troye's speed is ( frac{L}{56} ), and Daniella's speed is ( frac{L}{42} ), then their combined speed is ( frac{L}{56} + frac{L}{42} ). Let me compute that.First, find a common denominator for 56 and 42. 56 is 7*8, 42 is 7*6, so LCM is 7*8*6=336.So, ( frac{L}{56} = frac{6L}{336} ) and ( frac{L}{42} = frac{8L}{336} ). So, together, their speed is ( frac{6L + 8L}{336} = frac{14L}{336} = frac{L}{24} ). So, their combined speed is ( frac{L}{24} ) per second, which means they cover the track length ( L ) in 24 seconds. That matches the given information. So, that seems consistent.Therefore, Daniella's lap time is 42 seconds, which is option (E). Hmm, but wait, let me check the options again. The options are (A) 32, (B) 36, (C) 40, (D) 48, (E) 42.Yes, 42 is an option, so that's probably the answer. But just to make sure, let me think about another approach.Alternatively, we can think in terms of how much of the track each covers before they meet.In 24 seconds, Troye would cover ( frac{24}{56} ) of the track, which simplifies to ( frac{3}{7} ) of the track.Similarly, Daniella would cover ( frac{24}{t} ) of the track in the same time.Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of the distances they cover should equal one full lap, which is 1. So,( frac{24}{56} + frac{24}{t} = 1 )Simplify ( frac{24}{56} ) to ( frac{3}{7} ). So,( frac{3}{7} + frac{24}{t} = 1 )Subtract ( frac{3}{7} ) from both sides:( frac{24}{t} = frac{4}{7} )So, ( frac{24}{t} = frac{4}{7} )Cross-multiplying:( 4t = 24 * 7 )( 4t = 168 )Divide both sides by 4:( t = 42 )Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. So, Daniella takes 42 seconds to complete one lap. So, the answer is (E) 42.But just to make sure, let me think about the concept again. When two people are moving towards each other on a circular track, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds. The time between meetings is the time it takes for them to cover the entire circumference together. So, if I denote their speeds as ( v_T ) and ( v_D ), then:( (v_T + v_D) * t_{meet} = L )Where ( t_{meet} ) is 24 seconds. So, substituting ( v_T = frac{L}{56} ) and ( v_D = frac{L}{t} ), we get:( left( frac{L}{56} + frac{L}{t} right) * 24 = L )Divide both sides by L:( left( frac{1}{56} + frac{1}{t} right) * 24 = 1 )Which simplifies to:( frac{24}{56} + frac{24}{t} = 1 )Which is the same equation as before, leading to ( t = 42 ). So, that's consistent.I think I've verified it multiple ways, so I feel confident that 42 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Sangho uploaded a video to a website where viewers can vote that they like or dislike a video.

It turned out that the sum of no two of them equals 100.Is it true that among the chosen numbers, there will always be a square of some integer?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out if among 50 different numbers chosen from 1 to 100, there will always be a square of some integer, given that no two numbers sum up to 100. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We're selecting 50 distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 100}. The condition is that for any two numbers in this selected set, their sum doesn't equal 100. The question is asking whether, under these conditions, there must necessarily be at least one perfect square in our selected set.Alright, so the key points here are:1. We're choosing 50 numbers from 1 to 100.2. No two numbers in the chosen set add up to 100.3. We need to determine if at least one of these numbers is a perfect square.I think the first thing to do is to understand how the condition about the sums not equaling 100 affects our selection. So, let's consider pairs of numbers that add up to 100. For example, 1 and 99, 2 and 98, 3 and 97, and so on, up to 49 and 51. Each of these pairs sums to 100. Then, there's the number 50, which when paired with itself would sum to 100, but since we're choosing distinct numbers, we can only have 50 once or not at all.So, how many such pairs are there? Let's see, from 1 to 99, each pair adds up to 100. So, starting from 1, the pairs are (1,99), (2,98), ..., (49,51). That's 49 pairs. Then, the number 50 is alone because 50 + 50 = 100, but since we can't have duplicates, 50 is a singleton in this context.Therefore, in total, we have 49 pairs and one singleton, making 50 elements. So, if we're selecting 50 numbers without any two summing to 100, we have to choose at most one number from each pair. Since there are 49 pairs, we can choose one from each pair, giving us 49 numbers, and then we can also include the singleton 50, making it 50 numbers in total.Wait, so if we choose one number from each of the 49 pairs, that's 49 numbers, and then we can include 50 as the 50th number. So, that gives us a maximum of 50 numbers without any two summing to 100. So, in this case, the maximum size of such a set is 50, which is exactly what we're selecting.Therefore, the set of 50 numbers must consist of one number from each of the 49 pairs and the number 50. So, in other words, for each pair (k, 100 - k), we choose either k or 100 - k, but not both. And then we include 50.Now, the question is, does such a set necessarily contain a perfect square?Hmm, so maybe I should list all the perfect squares between 1 and 100. Let me do that.The perfect squares between 1 and 100 are:1^2 = 12^2 = 43^2 = 94^2 = 165^2 = 256^2 = 367^2 = 498^2 = 649^2 = 8110^2 = 100So, the squares are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.Now, 100 is a special case because 100 is the endpoint, but since we're choosing numbers from 1 to 100, 100 is included in the range. However, in our selection, if we include 100, we have to make sure that we don't include 0, but since we're starting from 1, 0 isn't in our set. But actually, 100 is part of the pair (1,99), but wait, no, 100 is a number on its own because 100 + 0 = 100, but 0 isn't in our set. So, actually, 100 is a singleton in terms of pairing because there's no other number in 1-100 that pairs with it to make 100 except itself, which we can't include.Wait, hold on, actually, 100 is in the pair (100, 0), but since 0 isn't in our set, 100 is a singleton. So, similar to 50, 100 is a singleton. But in our selection, we can choose either 100 or not, but if we choose 100, we can't choose any number that pairs with it to make 100, but since the only such number is 0, which isn't in our set, 100 can be included without any conflict.But wait, in our initial pairing, we considered pairs from 1 to 99, each adding up to 100. So, 100 is outside of that pairing. So, in our selection, we can choose 100 as an additional number beyond the 50 we already have? Wait, no, because our selection is exactly 50 numbers. So, if we include 100, we have to exclude one of the other numbers.Wait, let me clarify. The total numbers from 1 to 100 can be divided into 50 pairs that sum to 100, but actually, wait, 100 is an even number, so 100 divided by 2 is 50. So, actually, 100 is part of a pair with 0, but since 0 isn't in our set, 100 is a singleton. So, actually, the number of pairs is 49, as I initially thought, because 1 pairs with 99, 2 with 98, ..., 49 with 51, and then 50 is a singleton, and 100 is another singleton.Wait, hold on, that's actually 50 pairs: (1,99), (2,98), ..., (49,51), (50,50), and (100,0). But since 0 isn't in our set, 100 is a singleton. So, in total, we have 50 pairs, but two of them are singletons: 50 and 100.Wait, no, actually, 50 is a singleton because 50 + 50 = 100, but since we can't have duplicates, 50 can only be included once. Similarly, 100 is a singleton because 100 + 0 = 100, but 0 isn't in our set.So, in total, how many pairs do we have? Let's see:From 1 to 99, pairing each k with 100 - k, that's 49 pairs because 1 pairs with 99, 2 with 98, ..., 49 with 51. Then, 50 is a singleton, and 100 is another singleton.So, in total, we have 49 pairs, 1 singleton (50), and 1 singleton (100). So, that's 51 elements? Wait, no, 49 pairs make 98 numbers, plus 50 and 100, that's 100 numbers. So, yeah, 49 pairs, and two singletons, 50 and 100.Therefore, when selecting 50 numbers without any two summing to 100, we can choose at most one from each pair. So, from the 49 pairs, we choose one number each, giving us 49 numbers, and then we can choose either 50 or 100 or neither, but since we need 50 numbers, we have to choose one more. So, we can choose either 50 or 100, or both? Wait, no, because 50 and 100 are singletons, but they don't pair with each other. 50 + 100 = 150, which isn't 100, so they can coexist.Wait, hold on, actually, 50 and 100 can both be included in the set because their sum is 150, which doesn't violate the condition. So, in that case, if we choose both 50 and 100, that's two numbers, but we only need one more after choosing 49 from the pairs.Wait, no, let's think again. We have 49 pairs, each contributing one number, so that's 49 numbers. Then, we have two singletons: 50 and 100. So, to reach 50 numbers, we can choose either 50 or 100 or both. But if we choose both, that would give us 51 numbers, which is more than allowed. So, actually, we can choose at most one of the singletons, or neither, but since we need exactly 50 numbers, we have to choose exactly one of them.Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 49 pairs give us 49 numbers, and then we have two singletons. So, if we choose one singleton, we get 50 numbers. If we choose both, we get 51, which is too many. So, in order to have exactly 50 numbers, we can choose one singleton or none. But if we choose none, we only have 49 numbers, which is less than 50. Therefore, we must choose exactly one singleton, either 50 or 100, to make the total 50 numbers.Therefore, in any such set of 50 numbers with no two summing to 100, we must include either 50 or 100, but not both.Wait, but 100 is a number in the set, so if we include 100, is that allowed? Because 100 is a singleton, as it doesn't pair with any other number in 1-100 except itself or 0, which isn't in the set. So, including 100 is fine.So, in summary, our set of 50 numbers must consist of one number from each of the 49 pairs (1,99), (2,98), ..., (49,51), and exactly one of the singletons 50 or 100.Now, the question is, does such a set necessarily contain a perfect square?To answer this, I think we need to consider whether it's possible to construct a set of 50 numbers without any two summing to 100 and without containing any perfect squares. If such a set exists, then the answer would be no; otherwise, yes.So, let's try to see if such a set is possible.First, let's list all the perfect squares between 1 and 100 again: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.So, we have 10 perfect squares in total.Now, let's see how these squares are distributed in the pairs and singletons.Looking at the pairs:- (1,99): 1 is a square, 99 is not.- (4,96): 4 is a square, 96 is not.- (9,91): 9 is a square, 91 is not.- (16,84): 16 is a square, 84 is not.- (25,75): 25 is a square, 75 is not.- (36,64): Both 36 and 64 are squares.- (49,51): 49 is a square, 51 is not.- (64,36): Same as above.- (81,19): 81 is a square, 19 is not.- (100,0): 100 is a square, 0 is not.Wait, hold on, actually, in the pairs, each pair is (k, 100 - k). So, let's go through each pair and note if either element is a square.1. (1,99): 1 is a square.2. (2,98): Neither is a square.3. (3,97): Neither is a square.4. (4,96): 4 is a square.5. (5,95): Neither is a square.6. (6,94): Neither is a square.7. (7,93): Neither is a square.8. (8,92): Neither is a square.9. (9,91): 9 is a square.10. (10,90): Neither is a square.11. (11,89): Neither is a square.12. (12,88): Neither is a square.13. (13,87): Neither is a square.14. (14,86): Neither is a square.15. (15,85): Neither is a square.16. (16,84): 16 is a square.17. (17,83): Neither is a square.18. (18,82): Neither is a square.19. (19,81): 81 is a square.20. (20,80): Neither is a square.21. (21,79): Neither is a square.22. (22,78): Neither is a square.23. (23,77): Neither is a square.24. (24,76): Neither is a square.25. (25,75): 25 is a square.26. (26,74): Neither is a square.27. (27,73): Neither is a square.28. (28,72): Neither is a square.29. (29,71): Neither is a square.30. (30,70): Neither is a square.31. (31,69): Neither is a square.32. (32,68): Neither is a square.33. (33,67): Neither is a square.34. (34,66): Neither is a square.35. (35,65): Neither is a square.36. (36,64): Both are squares.37. (37,63): Neither is a square.38. (38,62): Neither is a square.39. (39,61): Neither is a square.40. (40,60): Neither is a square.41. (41,59): Neither is a square.42. (42,58): Neither is a square.43. (43,57): Neither is a square.44. (44,56): Neither is a square.45. (45,55): Neither is a square.46. (46,54): Neither is a square.47. (47,53): Neither is a square.48. (48,52): Neither is a square.49. (49,51): 49 is a square.So, in the 49 pairs, the pairs that contain a square are:1. (1,99)4. (4,96)9. (9,91)16. (16,84)19. (19,81)25. (25,75)36. (36,64)49. (49,51)So, that's 8 pairs where one element is a square, and one pair (36,64) where both are squares.Additionally, the singletons are 50 and 100. 50 is not a square, but 100 is a square.So, in total, the squares are spread across these pairs and the singleton 100.Now, if we want to construct a set of 50 numbers without any two summing to 100 and without any squares, we need to avoid choosing any squares. So, in each pair that contains a square, we have to choose the non-square element.But let's see how many such pairs there are. From above, we have 8 pairs where one element is a square, and one pair where both are squares.Wait, actually, in pair 36, both 36 and 64 are squares. So, if we want to avoid squares, we cannot choose either 36 or 64. But in pair 36, both are squares, so we have to exclude both, but we can only choose one from the pair. So, in this case, we cannot choose either 36 or 64, but we have to choose one, which is impossible because both are squares. Therefore, in this pair, we cannot choose either without including a square. So, this is a problem.Wait, so in pair (36,64), both are squares. So, if we want to avoid squares, we cannot choose either 36 or 64, but we have to choose one of them because we have to choose one from each pair. Therefore, it's impossible to avoid squares in this pair. Therefore, in any selection of one from each pair, we have to include at least one square from this pair.Therefore, in our set of 50 numbers, we must include either 36 or 64, both of which are squares. Therefore, regardless of our choices in other pairs, we have to include at least one square.Wait, hold on, is that correct? Because in pair (36,64), both are squares, so if we choose either, we include a square. So, in this case, we cannot avoid including a square from this pair. Therefore, regardless of how we choose the other pairs, we have to include at least one square.Therefore, in any such set of 50 numbers, we must include at least one square.Wait, but hold on, let me double-check. So, if we have pair (36,64), both squares, so we have to choose one, which is a square. Therefore, regardless of our choices elsewhere, we must include a square. Therefore, the answer is yes, there will always be a square in the chosen set.But wait, hold on, let me think again. Is there a way to choose the singleton 100 instead of choosing from pair (36,64)? Wait, no, because pair (36,64) is separate from the singleton. So, regardless of whether we choose 50 or 100 as the singleton, we still have to choose one from pair (36,64), which is a square.Therefore, even if we choose 100 as the singleton, we still have to include either 36 or 64 in our set, which are squares. Therefore, regardless of how we construct our set, we have to include at least one square.Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a set will always contain a square.Wait, but hold on, let me think of another angle. Suppose we try to avoid squares as much as possible. So, in all pairs where one element is a square, we choose the non-square. But in pair (36,64), both are squares, so we can't avoid it. Therefore, we have to include at least one square.Therefore, regardless of how we choose, we have to include at least one square. Therefore, the answer is yes.Alternatively, let's count how many squares are in the pairs and see if we can avoid them.We have 10 squares in total. 8 of them are in the 49 pairs, with each pair containing one square except for pair (36,64), which contains two squares. So, in total, 8 pairs have one square each, and one pair has two squares.Therefore, the number of squares is 8 + 2 = 10, which matches our earlier list.Now, if we try to avoid squares, in each of the 8 pairs with one square, we can choose the non-square. But in the pair with two squares, we have no choice but to include a square.Therefore, in the 49 pairs, we have to include at least one square from pair (36,64). So, regardless of our choices in the other pairs, we have to include at least one square.Therefore, in any such set of 50 numbers, we must include at least one square.Hence, the answer is yes, there will always be a square in the chosen set.**Final Answer**boxed{Yes}"},{"question":"Given an arbitrary angle  alpha , compute cos alpha + cos big( alpha +frac{2pi }{3 }big) + cos big( alpha +frac{4pi }{3 }big)  and  sin alpha + sin big( alpha +frac{2pi }{3 } big) + sin big( alpha +frac{4pi }{3 } big)  .Generalize this result and justify your answer.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute two sums involving cosine and sine functions with angles that are each separated by 120 degrees, or 2π/3 radians. The expressions are:1. cos α + cos(α + 2π/3) + cos(α + 4π/3)2. sin α + sin(α + 2π/3) + sin(α + 4π/3)And then I need to generalize this result. Hmm, interesting. I remember that when dealing with sums of trigonometric functions with equally spaced angles, there might be some symmetry or identity that can simplify things. Let me think about this step by step.First, let me tackle the cosine sum. Maybe I can use the formula for the sum of cosines with angles in arithmetic progression. I recall that the formula is:cos A + cos(A + D) + cos(A + 2D) + ... + cos(A + (n-1)D) = [sin(nD/2) / sin(D/2)] * cos(A + (n-1)D/2)But in this case, I have three terms, so n=3, and the common difference D is 2π/3. Let me plug in the values.So, for the cosine sum:cos α + cos(α + 2π/3) + cos(α + 4π/3) = [sin(3*(2π/3)/2) / sin((2π/3)/2)] * cos(α + (3-1)*(2π/3)/2)Wait, let me compute that step by step.First, compute the numerator: sin(3*(2π/3)/2) = sin( (6π/3)/2 ) = sin(2π/2) = sin(π) = 0.And the denominator: sin((2π/3)/2) = sin(π/3) = √3/2.So the entire expression becomes [0 / (√3/2)] * cos(...). But 0 divided by anything is 0, so the whole sum is 0. So, the cosine sum is 0.Wait, is that right? Let me check with specific angles to see if this makes sense. For example, let me take α = 0.Then the sum becomes cos(0) + cos(2π/3) + cos(4π/3). Calculating each term:cos(0) = 1cos(2π/3) = -1/2cos(4π/3) = -1/2Adding them up: 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 = 0. Yep, that works. So, the cosine sum is indeed 0. Okay, that seems solid.Now, let's move on to the sine sum. Similarly, I can use the formula for the sum of sines with angles in arithmetic progression:sin A + sin(A + D) + sin(A + 2D) + ... + sin(A + (n-1)D) = [sin(nD/2) / sin(D/2)] * sin(A + (n-1)D/2)Again, n=3, D=2π/3.So, plugging in:sin α + sin(α + 2π/3) + sin(α + 4π/3) = [sin(3*(2π/3)/2) / sin((2π/3)/2)] * sin(α + (3-1)*(2π/3)/2)Compute numerator: sin(3*(2π/3)/2) = sin( (6π/3)/2 ) = sin(2π/2) = sin(π) = 0.Denominator: sin((2π/3)/2) = sin(π/3) = √3/2.So, again, [0 / (√3/2)] * sin(...) = 0. So, the sine sum is also 0.Wait, let me test this with α = 0 as well.sin(0) + sin(2π/3) + sin(4π/3) = 0 + (√3/2) + (-√3/2) = 0. Yep, that's correct.Hmm, so both sums are zero. That's interesting. So regardless of α, adding these three cosines or these three sines gives zero.But why is that? Maybe it's because the angles are spaced 120 degrees apart, which are the third roots of unity in the complex plane. So, if I think of each term as a vector in the complex plane, adding them together would result in zero because they are symmetrically placed around the circle.Let me elaborate. If I represent each cosine and sine term as the real and imaginary parts of a complex exponential, respectively, then:cos α + i sin α + cos(α + 2π/3) + i sin(α + 2π/3) + cos(α + 4π/3) + i sin(α + 4π/3)This is equivalent to:e^{iα} + e^{i(α + 2π/3)} + e^{i(α + 4π/3)}Factor out e^{iα}:e^{iα} [1 + e^{i2π/3} + e^{i4π/3}]Now, 1, e^{i2π/3}, e^{i4π/3} are the cube roots of unity. And the sum of the cube roots of unity is zero because they satisfy the equation x^3 - 1 = 0, so 1 + x + x^2 = 0 when x ≠ 1. Hence, the sum inside the brackets is zero, so the entire expression is zero.Therefore, both the real part (the cosine sum) and the imaginary part (the sine sum) must be zero. That's a neat way to see it using complex numbers.So, generalizing this result, if we have n equally spaced angles around the unit circle, their sum as vectors (or as complex exponentials) will be zero if n is a divisor of the full circle, which is 2π. In this case, n=3, and 2π/3 is the spacing, which divides 2π exactly 3 times. So, the vectors cancel each other out.Therefore, for any angle α, the sum of cos α, cos(α + 2π/3), and cos(α + 4π/3) is zero, and similarly for the sine terms.I think that's a solid justification. Let me just recap:1. Recognized the problem involves summing trigonometric functions with equally spaced angles.2. Applied the sum formulas for cosine and sine in arithmetic progression, which both resulted in zero.3. Verified with specific angles (α=0) to confirm the result.4. Connected the result to complex exponentials and the roots of unity, providing a geometric interpretation.5. Generalized the result based on the symmetry and properties of roots of unity.So, yeah, both sums are zero. It all ties back to the symmetry of the unit circle and the properties of complex numbers. That's pretty cool!**Final Answer**Both sums are equal to zero. Therefore, the results are boxed{0} for both the cosine and sine sums.**Final Answer**The sums are both equal to boxed{0}."},{"question":"Calculate the limit of the numerical sequence:lim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{n^{3}-(n-1)^{3}}{(n+1)^{4}-n^{4}}","answer":"Okay, so I have this limit to calculate: the limit as n approaches infinity of [n³ - (n - 1)³] divided by [(n + 1)⁴ - n⁴]. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving polynomials, especially as n approaches infinity, the highest degree terms usually dominate. So, maybe I can expand both the numerator and the denominator and see what cancels out or simplifies.Let me start with the numerator: n³ - (n - 1)³. I think I can expand (n - 1)³ using the binomial theorem. The expansion of (a - b)³ is a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³. So applying that here:(n - 1)³ = n³ - 3n²(1) + 3n(1)² - (1)³ = n³ - 3n² + 3n - 1.So, the numerator becomes n³ - (n³ - 3n² + 3n - 1). Let me compute that:n³ - n³ + 3n² - 3n + 1. The n³ terms cancel out, so we're left with 3n² - 3n + 1.Alright, so numerator simplifies to 3n² - 3n + 1.Now, moving on to the denominator: (n + 1)⁴ - n⁴. I'll use the binomial theorem again for (n + 1)⁴. The expansion is n⁴ + 4n³ + 6n² + 4n + 1.So, (n + 1)⁴ - n⁴ = [n⁴ + 4n³ + 6n² + 4n + 1] - n⁴. The n⁴ terms cancel out, leaving 4n³ + 6n² + 4n + 1.Therefore, the denominator simplifies to 4n³ + 6n² + 4n + 1.So now, the original limit becomes:lim (n→∞) [3n² - 3n + 1] / [4n³ + 6n² + 4n + 1]Hmm, okay. Now, when n is approaching infinity, the highest degree terms in the numerator and denominator will dominate the behavior of the expression. So, let's identify the leading terms.In the numerator, the highest degree term is 3n², and in the denominator, it's 4n³. So, as n becomes very large, the expression should behave roughly like (3n²)/(4n³) = 3/(4n). As n approaches infinity, 3/(4n) approaches 0.But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I should divide both numerator and denominator by the highest power of n in the denominator, which is n³, to see what happens.So, let's rewrite the expression:[3n² - 3n + 1] / [4n³ + 6n² + 4n + 1] = [ (3n²)/n³ - (3n)/n³ + 1/n³ ] / [ (4n³)/n³ + (6n²)/n³ + (4n)/n³ + 1/n³ ]Simplifying each term:Numerator: 3/n - 3/n² + 1/n³Denominator: 4 + 6/n + 4/n² + 1/n³So, the expression becomes:[3/n - 3/n² + 1/n³] / [4 + 6/n + 4/n² + 1/n³]Now, as n approaches infinity, each term with n in the denominator will approach 0. So, the numerator approaches 0 - 0 + 0 = 0, and the denominator approaches 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4. Therefore, the entire expression approaches 0/4 = 0.Wait, so does that mean the limit is 0? That seems consistent with my initial thought.But just to double-check, maybe I can factor out n² from the numerator and n³ from the denominator.Numerator: n²(3 - 3/n + 1/n²)Denominator: n³(4 + 6/n + 4/n² + 1/n³)So, the expression becomes [n²(3 - 3/n + 1/n²)] / [n³(4 + 6/n + 4/n² + 1/n³)] = (3 - 3/n + 1/n²) / [n(4 + 6/n + 4/n² + 1/n³)]Again, as n approaches infinity, the terms with 1/n, 1/n², etc., go to zero, so we have 3 / [n * 4] = 3/(4n), which goes to 0 as n approaches infinity.So, both methods confirm that the limit is 0.Alternatively, I can use the concept of leading terms. The numerator is a quadratic in n, and the denominator is a cubic in n. So, as n grows, the denominator grows much faster than the numerator, making the whole fraction tend to zero.Therefore, I feel confident now that the limit is indeed 0.**Final Answer**The limit is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Given 25 vessels with capacities 1, 2,ldots, 25 liters, in how many ways can you choose ten of them such that any two selected vessels can be used to measure out exactly 1 liter of water? (An unlimited amount of water is available, and it is possible to transfer water from one vessel to another.)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: there are 25 vessels with capacities from 1 to 25 liters. I need to choose ten of them such that any two selected vessels can be used to measure exactly 1 liter of water. The question is asking how many ways I can do this. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what it means for two vessels to measure exactly 1 liter. I remember that if you have two containers with capacities that are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), you can measure out any amount that is a multiple of their GCD. Since their GCD is 1, you can measure out exactly 1 liter. So, does that mean that any two selected vessels must have capacities that are coprime?Wait, let me think again. If two vessels have capacities a and b, and gcd(a, b) = d, then the smallest amount you can measure is d liters. So, to measure exactly 1 liter, d must be 1. So yes, any two selected vessels must be coprime. That makes sense.So, the problem reduces to selecting ten vessels from 1 to 25 such that every pair of selected vessels is coprime. And we need to find how many such selections are possible.Alright, so now the problem is about selecting a set of ten numbers from 1 to 25 where every pair is coprime. How do I approach this?I think I need to consider the prime numbers because primes are only divisible by 1 and themselves, so they are coprime with many numbers. But wait, not necessarily all. For example, 2 and 4 are not coprime, even though 2 is prime. So, if I include 2, I have to be careful not to include any even numbers.Similarly, if I include 3, I have to avoid multiples of 3, like 6, 9, 12, etc. So, primes themselves are good, but their multiples are problematic.But wait, 1 is a special case. The number 1 is coprime with every number because its only divisor is 1. So, including 1 might be beneficial because it can pair with any other number without violating the coprime condition.So, maybe I should consider whether to include 1 or not. If I include 1, then the other nine numbers just need to be coprime with each other and with 1, which is automatically satisfied. So, perhaps including 1 is a good idea because it gives me more flexibility with the other numbers.But then again, if I include 1, I have to make sure that the other nine numbers are pairwise coprime. That might be challenging because numbers can have common factors. So, maybe I should think about how to construct such a set.Alternatively, if I don't include 1, then all ten numbers must be pairwise coprime. That might be even more restrictive because each number has to be coprime with all the others, which could limit the choices a lot.So, perhaps including 1 is the way to go because it allows me to have one number that doesn't interfere with the others, and then I can focus on selecting nine other numbers that are pairwise coprime.Let me try that approach.So, if I include 1, then I need to choose nine more numbers from 2 to 25 such that every pair among these nine is coprime. Hmm, okay.How can I select nine numbers from 2 to 25 that are pairwise coprime? Let's think about prime numbers again because primes are only divisible by 1 and themselves, so they are coprime with each other unless they are the same prime.But wait, primes can be repeated? No, in this case, each vessel is unique, so we can't have duplicate primes. So, each prime can be selected only once.So, how many primes are there between 2 and 25? Let's list them out:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.That's nine primes. So, if I include all these nine primes, along with 1, that would give me a set of ten numbers where every pair is coprime. Because 1 is coprime with all, and the primes are coprime with each other.Wait, but hold on. 2 and 3 are coprime, 2 and 5 are coprime, and so on. So, yes, all these primes are pairwise coprime. So, that's one possible set.But the question is asking for how many such sets exist. So, is this the only set? Or are there other sets where instead of including all the primes, we include some composite numbers that are coprime with the others?Hmm, that's a good point. Because composite numbers can also be coprime with other numbers if they don't share any common factors.For example, 4 is composite, but if I include 4, I have to make sure that none of the other numbers are even or multiples of 2. But since 2 is a prime, if I include 4, I can't include 2. But 2 is a small prime, so it's probably better to include 2 instead of 4 because 2 is a building block for more numbers.Wait, but if I include 4, I have to exclude 2, 6, 8, etc. So, maybe it's more efficient to include 2 instead of 4 because 2 is a prime and can be used to measure 1 liter with other coprimes.But let's think about whether we can include some composite numbers without violating the pairwise coprime condition.For example, 25 is a composite number (5 squared). If I include 25, I have to exclude 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. But 5 is a prime, so if I include 25, I have to exclude 5. But 5 is a prime, so maybe it's better to include 5 instead of 25 because 5 is a prime and can be used with more numbers.Similarly, 9 is 3 squared. If I include 9, I have to exclude 3, 6, 12, etc. But 3 is a prime, so again, it's better to include 3 instead of 9.So, in general, it's better to include the primes rather than their higher powers because primes are more versatile in being coprime with other numbers.Therefore, the set with 1 and all the primes from 2 to 23 would be a valid set. But are there other sets that include some composite numbers instead of some primes?Let me think. Suppose I exclude one prime and include a composite number that is coprime with all the others. Is that possible?For example, let's say I exclude 2 and include 4. But then, 4 is not coprime with any even number, so I have to make sure that none of the other numbers are even. But 4 is even, so if I include 4, I have to exclude all even numbers. But 2 is a prime, so if I exclude 2, I can include 4, but then I have to exclude all other even numbers as well.But wait, in the set, if I include 4, I can't include any other even numbers, but 4 is already even, so all other numbers must be odd. But 4 is 2 squared, so it's still even, so any other even number would share a factor of 2 with 4. So, yes, if I include 4, I have to exclude all other even numbers.But in that case, how many numbers can I include? Let's see:If I include 1, 4, and then the other primes except 2. So, the primes from 3 to 23 are 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. That's eight primes. So, including 1, 4, and these eight primes would give me a total of ten numbers.Wait, but 4 is not coprime with 3? No, 4 and 3 are coprime because their GCD is 1. 4 and 5 are coprime, 4 and 7 are coprime, etc. So, yes, 4 can be included with the other primes except 2.So, that gives another set: {1,4,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}. So, that's another valid set.Similarly, can I do this with other primes? For example, exclude 3 and include 9? Let's see.If I exclude 3 and include 9, then I have to make sure that 9 doesn't share any common factors with the other numbers. 9 is 3 squared, so it's not coprime with 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. But since I'm excluding 3, I have to make sure that none of the other numbers are multiples of 3.So, if I include 9, I have to exclude 3,6,12,15,18,21,24. So, that's a lot of numbers. But in the set, I have 1, 9, and the primes except 3. The primes except 3 are 2,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. That's eight primes. So, including 1,9, and these eight primes would give me ten numbers.But wait, 9 and 2 are coprime? Yes, because 9 is 3 squared and 2 is prime, so their GCD is 1. Similarly, 9 and 5, 9 and 7, etc., are all coprime. So, yes, that set would be valid.So, that's another set: {1,9,2,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}.Similarly, can I exclude 5 and include 25? Let's check.If I exclude 5 and include 25, then I have to make sure that 25 doesn't share any common factors with the other numbers. 25 is 5 squared, so it's not coprime with 5,10,15,20,25. So, I have to exclude 5,10,15,20,25. But I'm excluding 5, so I have to make sure that none of the other numbers are multiples of 5.So, including 25, I have to exclude 5,10,15,20,25. But 25 is already included, so we have to exclude the others. So, in the set, we have 1,25, and the primes except 5. The primes except 5 are 2,3,7,11,13,17,19,23. That's eight primes. So, including 1,25, and these eight primes gives us ten numbers.But wait, 25 and 2 are coprime? Yes, because 25 is 5 squared and 2 is prime, so GCD(25,2)=1. Similarly, 25 and 3 are coprime, 25 and 7 are coprime, etc. So, yes, that's another valid set.So, that's another set: {1,25,2,3,7,11,13,17,19,23}.So, it seems like for each prime, I can choose to either include the prime or include its square (if it's within 25). But wait, not all primes have their squares within 25. For example, 7 squared is 49, which is beyond 25, so I can't include 49. Similarly, 11 squared is 121, which is way beyond. So, only the primes 2,3,5 have their squares within 25.So, for primes 2,3,5, I can choose to include either the prime or its square, but not both. For the other primes (7,11,13,17,19,23), their squares are beyond 25, so we can't include them. Therefore, for these primes, we have to include them as they are.So, let me summarize:- For primes 2,3,5: each can be included as themselves or as their squares (4,9,25). So, for each of these three primes, we have two choices: include the prime or include its square.- For primes 7,11,13,17,19,23: we have no choice but to include them as they are, since their squares are beyond 25.- Additionally, we can include 1, which is coprime with all.Therefore, the total number of such sets would be determined by the number of choices we have for the primes 2,3,5. Since each of these three primes has two choices (prime or square), the total number of combinations is 2^3 = 8.But wait, hold on. If we include 1, then we have to include nine more numbers. The nine numbers are either the primes 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23 or their squares where applicable.But if we choose to replace some primes with their squares, we have to make sure that the squares don't conflict with each other or with the other primes.Wait, for example, if I replace 2 with 4, I have to make sure that 4 doesn't conflict with any other numbers. Since 4 is 2 squared, it's even, so it's not coprime with any other even numbers. But since we are replacing 2 with 4, we have to ensure that none of the other numbers are even. But 4 is even, so all other numbers must be odd.But in our set, the other primes are 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23, which are all odd. So, 4 is coprime with all of them. Similarly, 9 is 3 squared, which is odd, so it's coprime with all the other primes except 3. But since we are replacing 3 with 9, we have to make sure that 9 is coprime with the other numbers, which it is.Similarly, 25 is 5 squared, which is odd, so it's coprime with all the other primes except 5. So, replacing 5 with 25 is okay.Therefore, each replacement is independent because replacing 2 with 4 doesn't affect the coprimality with replacing 3 with 9 or 5 with 25, since 4,9,25 are all coprime with each other and with the other primes.So, since each replacement is independent, the total number of sets is 2^3 = 8.But wait, let's count them:1. Include 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,232. Include 4,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,233. Include 2,9,5,7,11,13,17,19,234. Include 2,3,25,7,11,13,17,19,235. Include 4,9,5,7,11,13,17,19,236. Include 4,3,25,7,11,13,17,19,237. Include 2,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,238. Include 4,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23So, that's eight different sets. Each set includes 1 and then either the prime or its square for 2,3,5, and all the other primes as they are.Therefore, the total number of ways is 8.But wait, hold on. The problem says \\"choose ten of them\\". So, in each case, we're choosing 1 plus nine other numbers. So, each set has ten numbers.But is 1 necessary? Or can we have a set without 1?Wait, if we don't include 1, then all ten numbers must be pairwise coprime. But in that case, can we have ten numbers from 2 to 25 that are pairwise coprime?Given that the primes from 2 to 23 are nine numbers, and 1 is the only number left that can be added without violating coprimality. So, without 1, we can only have nine numbers, which is less than ten. Therefore, to have ten numbers, we must include 1.Therefore, all valid sets must include 1 and nine other numbers, which are either primes or their squares (for 2,3,5). So, the total number of such sets is 8.Wait, but hold on. Are there any other composite numbers that can be included instead of primes or their squares?For example, can I include a number like 16 (which is 2^4) instead of 2 or 4? Let's see.If I include 16, I have to exclude all multiples of 2, which are a lot. So, including 16 would require excluding 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24. But 16 is already included, so we have to exclude the rest. But in our set, we have to include nine numbers besides 1. If we include 16, we have to exclude all even numbers, which are 12 numbers. So, we can only include 16 and the odd numbers.But the odd numbers from 3 to 25 are 3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25. That's twelve numbers. But we need to choose nine of them, excluding those that are multiples of 3,5, etc.Wait, but if we include 16, we have to make sure that the other numbers are coprime with 16, which means they can't be even, which they aren't, but they also can't share any other factors with 16. Since 16 is 2^4, the only common factor would be 2, which we've already excluded. So, as long as the other numbers are odd, they are coprime with 16.But then, among the odd numbers, we have to choose nine that are pairwise coprime. But the odd numbers include primes and composites. For example, 9 is 3 squared, 15 is 3*5, 21 is 3*7, 25 is 5 squared, etc.So, to choose nine pairwise coprime numbers from the odd numbers, we have to be careful. Let's see:If we include 16, then we need to choose nine numbers from the odd numbers (3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25) such that they are pairwise coprime.But how many primes are there in the odd numbers? The primes are 3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. That's eight primes. So, if we include 16, we can include these eight primes and one more composite number that is coprime with all of them.But wait, the composite numbers in the odd numbers are 9,15,21,25. Let's check if any of these can be included without violating coprimality.- 9: 9 is 3 squared. If we include 9, we have to exclude 3. But 3 is a prime, so if we exclude 3, we can include 9. But then, we have to check if 9 is coprime with the other primes. 9 is coprime with 5,7,11,13,17,19,23. So, yes, 9 can be included if we exclude 3.Similarly, 15 is 3*5. If we include 15, we have to exclude both 3 and 5. But 3 and 5 are primes, so excluding them would reduce the number of primes we can include. So, including 15 would require excluding two primes, which might not be beneficial because we need nine numbers.Similarly, 21 is 3*7. Including 21 would require excluding 3 and 7. Again, that's two primes.25 is 5 squared. Including 25 would require excluding 5. So, similar to 9, but only one prime is excluded.So, if we include 16, we can include 25 instead of 5, or 9 instead of 3, but not both because that would require excluding two primes, which would leave us with only seven primes, and then we can include two composite numbers, but we need nine numbers.Wait, let's see:If we include 16, we can include 25 instead of 5, and 9 instead of 3. So, we exclude 3 and 5, and include 9 and 25. Then, the primes we can include are 7,11,13,17,19,23. That's six primes. Plus 9,25, and 16. That's nine numbers. So, total numbers would be 1,16,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23. That's ten numbers.Wait, but 9 and 25 are included, which are composites, but they are coprime with each other and with the other primes. So, that works.Similarly, can we include both 9 and 25? Yes, as above.Alternatively, can we include 15 instead of 3 and 5? Let's see.If we include 15, we have to exclude 3 and 5. Then, the primes we can include are 7,11,13,17,19,23. That's six primes. Plus 15 and 16. That's eight numbers. We need nine, so we can include one more composite number. Let's see, 9 is 3 squared, but we've already excluded 3, so 9 is still coprime with the other primes. So, can we include 9 as well? But 9 is 3 squared, and we've excluded 3, but 9 is coprime with the other primes. So, including 9 would give us 1,16,15,9,7,11,13,17,19,23. That's ten numbers.But wait, 15 and 9 share a common factor of 3. So, gcd(15,9)=3, which is not 1. Therefore, they are not coprime. So, including both 15 and 9 would violate the pairwise coprime condition.Therefore, we can't include both 15 and 9. Similarly, including 15 and 25 would also be problematic because 15 is 3*5 and 25 is 5 squared, so they share a common factor of 5.Therefore, if we include 15, we can't include 5 or 25 or 3 or 9. So, including 15 would require excluding more numbers, which might not be beneficial.So, it seems that the only composite numbers we can include without causing conflicts are 9 and 25, each replacing their respective primes. So, in the case where we include 16, we can include 9 and 25 instead of 3 and 5, giving us a valid set.But wait, is 16 necessary? Or can we include other composite numbers instead?Wait, 16 is 2^4. If we include 16, we have to exclude all even numbers, which are 12 numbers. So, we can only include 16 and the odd numbers. But if we don't include 16, we can include 2 or 4, which are even, but then we have to exclude other even numbers.But in the previous analysis, we saw that including 16 allows us to include 9 and 25, but is that the only way? Or can we include other composite numbers?Wait, let's consider another composite number: 49 is beyond 25, so we can't include that. 8 is 2^3, but including 8 would require excluding 2,4,6, etc., similar to including 4. But 8 is even, so it's not coprime with any other even numbers.But 8 is 2^3, so it's similar to 4 in that sense. So, if we include 8 instead of 2 or 4, we have to exclude all other even numbers. But 8 is still even, so it's not coprime with any other even numbers. So, similar to 4, we can include 8 and exclude 2,4,6, etc.But 8 is 2^3, so it's not coprime with 2,4,6, etc., but it is coprime with all odd numbers. So, including 8 would allow us to include 9 and 25 as well, similar to including 4.Wait, so if we include 8 instead of 2 or 4, we can still include 9 and 25. So, that would be another set.So, let's see:- Include 1,8,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23.Is this a valid set? Let's check pairwise coprimality.- 8 is coprime with 9 (GCD=1), 25 (GCD=1), and all the primes 7,11,13,17,19,23.- 9 is coprime with 25 and all the primes.- 25 is coprime with all the primes.- All the primes are coprime with each other.So, yes, this is a valid set.Similarly, can we include 16 instead of 8? Let's see:- Include 1,16,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23.Is this valid? 16 is coprime with 9,25, and all the primes. 9 and 25 are coprime with each other and the primes. So, yes, this is another valid set.Wait, so now we have more sets. Previously, I thought only 8 sets, but now it seems like we can include 4,8,16 as replacements for 2, each giving different sets.Wait, so for the prime 2, we can choose to include 2,4,8,16? But 16 is 2^4, which is still even, so including 16 would require excluding all other even numbers, similar to including 4 or 8.But 4,8,16 are all powers of 2. So, if we include any of them, we have to exclude all other even numbers. So, for the prime 2, instead of including 2, we can include any of its higher powers (4,8,16), but we can't include more than one because they are not coprime with each other.Wait, but 4 and 8 are not coprime because GCD(4,8)=4. Similarly, 4 and 16 have GCD=4, and 8 and 16 have GCD=8. So, we can't include more than one power of 2.Therefore, for the prime 2, we have four choices: include 2,4,8, or 16. Each of these choices would exclude all other even numbers.Similarly, for prime 3, we can include 3 or 9.For prime 5, we can include 5 or 25.So, now, for each prime 2,3,5, we have multiple choices:- For 2: 2,4,8,16 (four choices)- For 3: 3,9 (two choices)- For 5: 5,25 (two choices)Therefore, the total number of combinations would be 4 * 2 * 2 = 16.But wait, hold on. Including 16 instead of 2 gives us a different set, as we saw earlier. Similarly, including 8 or 4 instead of 2 gives different sets. So, each choice for 2,3,5 multiplies the total number of sets.But wait, earlier I thought only 8 sets, but now it's 16. So, which is correct?Wait, let's think again. If for prime 2, we have four choices: 2,4,8,16. For each of these choices, we can independently choose to include 3 or 9, and 5 or 25. So, 4 * 2 * 2 = 16.But wait, does including 16 instead of 2 affect the other choices? For example, if we include 16, which is even, we have to exclude all other even numbers. But 16 is 2^4, so it's still even, so we have to exclude 2,4,6,8,10, etc. So, including 16 doesn't interfere with the choices for 3 and 5, because 16 is coprime with 3,9,5,25, etc.Similarly, including 8 or 4 instead of 2 doesn't interfere with the choices for 3 and 5.Therefore, each choice for 2 is independent of the choices for 3 and 5. So, the total number of sets is indeed 4 * 2 * 2 = 16.But wait, let's verify this by constructing some sets.1. Include 2,3,5: {1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}2. Include 2,3,25: {1,2,3,25,7,11,13,17,19,23}3. Include 2,9,5: {1,2,9,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}4. Include 2,9,25: {1,2,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23}5. Include 4,3,5: {1,4,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}6. Include 4,3,25: {1,4,3,25,7,11,13,17,19,23}7. Include 4,9,5: {1,4,9,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}8. Include 4,9,25: {1,4,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23}9. Include 8,3,5: {1,8,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}10. Include 8,3,25: {1,8,3,25,7,11,13,17,19,23}11. Include 8,9,5: {1,8,9,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}12. Include 8,9,25: {1,8,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23}13. Include 16,3,5: {1,16,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}14. Include 16,3,25: {1,16,3,25,7,11,13,17,19,23}15. Include 16,9,5: {1,16,9,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}16. Include 16,9,25: {1,16,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23}So, that's 16 different sets. Each set includes 1, and then for each of the primes 2,3,5, we choose either the prime itself or one of its higher powers (for 2: 4,8,16; for 3:9; for 5:25). Each choice is independent, so the total number is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16.Therefore, the total number of ways is 16.But wait, hold on. Is 16 a valid choice? Because 16 is 2^4, which is even, so it's not coprime with any other even numbers. But in the set, we have to make sure that 16 is coprime with all other numbers. Since all other numbers are odd, and 16 is a power of 2, it's coprime with all odd numbers. So, yes, 16 is fine.Similarly, 8 is 2^3, which is even, but coprime with all odd numbers. So, 8 is fine.So, each of these sets is valid.But wait, earlier I thought that for 2, we can choose between 2,4,8,16, but actually, 16 is beyond 25? Wait, no, 16 is 16, which is less than 25. So, 16 is within the range.Wait, 16 is 16, which is less than 25, so it's included in the vessels. So, yes, 16 is a valid vessel.So, all these sets are valid.Therefore, the total number of ways is 16.But wait, let me think again. Is there any other composite number that can be included without conflicting with the others?For example, 27 is beyond 25, so we can't include that. 18 is 2*3^2, which is even and shares factors with 2 and 3. So, including 18 would require excluding 2 and 3, but 18 is even, so it's not coprime with any other even numbers. But 18 is also a multiple of 3, so it's not coprime with 3 or 9 or 27 (which is beyond 25). So, including 18 would require excluding 2,3,6,9, etc., which might not be beneficial because we need to include nine numbers.Similarly, 20 is 2^2*5, which is even and shares factors with 5. So, including 20 would require excluding 2,4,5,10, etc., which would complicate things.Therefore, it seems that the only composite numbers we can include without causing conflicts are the squares of primes 2,3,5, which are 4,9,25, and the higher powers of 2, which are 8,16.But wait, 8 and 16 are not squares, but they are higher powers of 2. So, including them allows us to replace 2 with a higher power, but they are still even, so they have the same effect as including 4 in terms of excluding other even numbers.Therefore, the only composite numbers we can include are 4,8,16,9,25. Each of these can replace their respective primes, but we can't include more than one replacement for each prime.So, for prime 2, we can choose between 2,4,8,16.For prime 3, we can choose between 3,9.For prime 5, we can choose between 5,25.Each choice is independent, so the total number of sets is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16.Therefore, the answer is 16.But wait, let me check if all these sets are unique. For example, is the set {1,4,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23} different from {1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}? Yes, because the numbers included are different.Similarly, {1,8,9,25,7,11,13,17,19,23} is different because it includes 8 instead of 2 or 4.So, each set is unique based on the choices made for 2,3,5.Therefore, the total number of ways is 16.But wait, hold on. Let me think about whether including higher powers of 2 beyond 16 is possible. 32 is beyond 25, so we can't include that. So, 16 is the highest power of 2 within 25.Therefore, the choices for 2 are 2,4,8,16.So, 4 choices.For 3: 3,9.For 5:5,25.So, 2 choices each.Therefore, 4*2*2=16.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the number of ways is 16.But wait, let me think again. Is there any other composite number that can be included without conflicting with the others?For example, 49 is beyond 25, so we can't include it. 121 is way beyond. So, no.What about 1? 1 is already included in all sets, so we don't have a choice about that.Therefore, the total number of sets is 16.So, the answer is 16.But wait, hold on. Let me think about whether including 1 is mandatory. Earlier, I thought that without including 1, we can't have ten numbers because the primes from 2 to 23 are only nine numbers. So, to have ten numbers, we have to include 1.But let me verify that.If we don't include 1, can we have ten numbers from 2 to 25 that are pairwise coprime?Well, the primes from 2 to 23 are nine numbers. To get ten numbers, we need to include one more number. But that number has to be coprime with all the primes. The only number that is coprime with all primes is 1, because any composite number would have prime factors, which are already included in the set.Therefore, without including 1, we can't have ten pairwise coprime numbers from 2 to 25. So, 1 must be included in every valid set.Therefore, all valid sets must include 1 and nine other numbers, which are either primes or their squares (for 2,3,5) or higher powers of 2 (4,8,16).Therefore, the total number of sets is 16.So, the final answer is 16.But wait, let me think again. Is there any other way to include composite numbers without replacing primes?For example, can we include both 4 and 9? Let's see.If we include 4 and 9, we have to exclude 2 and 3. Then, we can include the other primes:5,7,11,13,17,19,23. That's seven primes. Plus 4 and 9. That's nine numbers. Plus 1. That's ten numbers.So, the set would be {1,4,9,5,7,11,13,17,19,23}. This is one of the sets we already counted earlier.Similarly, can we include 4,9,25? Yes, that's another set.But in this case, we are replacing 2,3,5 with their squares, which is allowed.So, in this case, we are not including the primes 2,3,5, but their squares instead.Therefore, all such sets are already accounted for in the 16 sets.Therefore, I think 16 is the correct answer.But wait, let me think about whether including 1 is the only way. For example, if we include 1, we can include 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23. But if we exclude 1, we can't include ten numbers because we only have nine primes.Therefore, 1 is necessary.Therefore, all valid sets must include 1, and then nine other numbers which are either primes or their squares (for 2,3,5) or higher powers of 2 (4,8,16). Each choice is independent, so the total number is 4*2*2=16.Therefore, the answer is 16.But wait, hold on. Let me think about whether including 16 is actually valid. Because 16 is 2^4, which is even, so it's not coprime with any other even numbers. But in the set, we have to make sure that 16 is coprime with all other numbers. Since all other numbers are odd, and 16 is a power of 2, it's coprime with all odd numbers. So, yes, 16 is fine.Similarly, 8 is 2^3, which is even, but coprime with all odd numbers. So, 8 is fine.Therefore, including 16 or 8 instead of 2 is valid.Therefore, the total number of sets is indeed 16.So, after all this thinking, I believe the answer is 16.**Final Answer**The number of ways is boxed{16}."},{"question":"Is it possible to place six photographers in a field in such a way that each of them can photograph exactly four others? (Photographers A and B can photograph each other if there are no other photographers on the segment AB.)","answer":"Alright, so I came across this interesting problem today: \\"Is it possible to place six photographers in a field such that each of them can photograph exactly four others?\\" The condition is that two photographers can photograph each other only if there are no other photographers on the segment connecting them. Hmm, okay, let me try to wrap my head around this.First off, let me rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We have six photographers, and we need to position them in a plane (since it's a field) such that each photographer can see exactly four others without any obstructions. That means, for each photographer, there should be four others who are directly visible to them, with no one else lying on the straight line between them. So, in graph theory terms, this is like constructing a graph with six nodes where each node has a degree of four, and the graph is a visibility graph.Wait, visibility graph? I think that's a concept where nodes represent points in a plane, and edges represent direct visibility between two points without any obstructions. So, in this case, we need a visibility graph with six nodes, each of degree four. Let me recall, in graph theory, the sum of all degrees must be even, which in this case, 6 nodes each with degree 4 gives a total degree of 24, which is even, so that condition is satisfied. So, at least from a graph theory perspective, it's possible.But the real challenge is whether such a configuration is possible in a plane without any three photographers being colinear, because if three are colinear, then the middle one would block the view between the other two. So, we need to arrange six points in a plane such that no three are colinear, and each point has exactly four others visible to it. Hmm, okay.Let me think about regular polygons. A regular pentagon has each vertex connected to two adjacent vertices, but that's only degree two. If we add a point in the center, then each vertex can see the center, so that would give each vertex degree three. But we need degree four. Hmm, maybe a regular hexagon? In a regular hexagon, each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices, but again, that's only degree two. If we connect each vertex to the opposite vertex, that would add another edge, making it degree three. Still not enough.Wait, maybe if we place the photographers not just on the perimeter but also inside? Let me think. If we have a regular pentagon with a point in the center, each vertex can see the center and its two adjacent vertices, so that's three connections. But we need four. Maybe if we add another point somewhere? Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.Alternatively, maybe a different configuration altogether. Let's think about the complete graph K6, which has each node connected to every other node. But in a plane, K6 isn't a visibility graph because you can't have all connections without some lines crossing or points being colinear. So, K6 is out of the question.Wait, so maybe we need a graph that's 4-regular and can be embedded as a visibility graph. I remember that visibility graphs can be quite complex, but perhaps certain configurations allow for higher degrees.Let me try to visualize. If I place five photographers in a regular pentagon and one in the center, then the center photographer can see all five on the perimeter. But each photographer on the perimeter can see the center and their two adjacent photographers, making it three connections each. So, that's not enough. Each needs to see four others.Hmm, so maybe if I place the photographers in such a way that each one can see two others on the perimeter and two others across? Wait, but in a regular pentagon, each photographer can only see two adjacent ones without obstruction. If I add a photographer in the center, they can see all five, but the ones on the perimeter can only see the center and their two neighbors. So, still only three connections.What if I arrange them in a different polygon? Maybe a hexagon? If I place six photographers at the vertices of a regular hexagon, each can see their two adjacent photographers. If I also connect each photographer to the one opposite them, that would add another connection, making it three. Still not four.Wait, but in a regular hexagon, each photographer is opposite another, so connecting each to their opposite would mean each has degree three (two adjacent, one opposite). But we need four. Maybe if we connect each to two others across? But in a regular hexagon, connecting to two others across would require lines that might intersect, causing visibility issues.Alternatively, maybe arranging the photographers in a three-dimensional shape projected onto a plane? Hmm, but the problem specifies a field, which is two-dimensional. So, 3D configurations won't help here.Wait, another thought: maybe arranging them in a star shape. If I have one photographer at the center and five around, but as I thought earlier, the center can see all five, but each outer one can only see the center and their two neighbors, which is three. Not enough.Alternatively, maybe two triangles overlapping? Let me think. If I have two triangles, one rotated relative to the other, forming a six-pointed star or something. But I'm not sure if that would allow each photographer to see four others without obstructions.Wait, let me try to sketch this out mentally. If I have two triangles, one upright and one inverted, forming a hexagram. Each point of the hexagram is a photographer. In this case, each photographer is part of both triangles. So, each photographer is connected to two others in their own triangle and two others in the other triangle. That would give each photographer degree four. Hmm, that sounds promising.But wait, in a hexagram, each point is connected to two others in its triangle and two others in the other triangle, but are these connections all visible? Because in a hexagram, the lines cross each other, so some connections might be obstructed. For example, if two photographers are connected by a line that passes through another photographer, then they can't see each other. So, that might be a problem.Wait, in a hexagram, the lines connecting the triangles cross at the center, but the photographers are only at the points, not at the intersections. So, maybe the lines connecting the triangles don't actually pass through any photographers, just through the center. So, perhaps each photographer can see the two in their own triangle and the two in the other triangle without obstruction.Let me think. If I have two triangles, one upright and one inverted, with their centers coinciding, then each photographer is part of one triangle and can see the two adjacent photographers in that triangle. Additionally, each photographer is connected to two photographers in the other triangle, but those lines would pass through the center. Since the center is empty (no photographer there), those lines wouldn't be obstructed. So, each photographer can see four others: two in their own triangle and two in the other triangle.Wait, but hold on. If the two triangles are overlapping, then each photographer is connected to two in their own triangle and two in the other, but do those connections cross any photographers? Let me visualize. Each line connecting a photographer in the upright triangle to one in the inverted triangle passes through the center, but since there's no photographer at the center, it's just a straight line without any obstructions. So, yes, each photographer can see four others: two adjacent in their own triangle and two across in the other triangle.So, in this configuration, each photographer has exactly four others they can photograph, and no three photographers are colinear because all the lines either connect two photographers directly or pass through the center, which is empty. Therefore, this seems to satisfy the conditions.But wait, let me double-check. Each photographer is part of a triangle, so they can see their two neighbors in that triangle. Then, they are connected to two photographers in the other triangle, which are the ones that are sort of opposite them. Since the lines connecting them pass through the center, which is empty, they can see those two as well. So, that's four connections per photographer.Is there any chance that a photographer might see more than four? Let's see. If I have two triangles, each photographer is connected to two in their own triangle and two in the other. So, that's four. There's no fifth connection because the other photographers are either in their own triangle or in the other, and the lines connecting them don't pass through any photographers. So, no, each photographer can only see four others.Wait, but hold on a second. If I have two triangles, each with three photographers, and each photographer in one triangle is connected to two in the other, does that mean that each photographer in the other triangle is being connected to by two photographers from the first triangle? So, for example, photographer A in the first triangle is connected to photographers D and E in the second triangle. Then, photographer B is connected to E and F, and photographer C is connected to F and D. So, each photographer in the second triangle is connected to two from the first. So, that works out.But does this cause any overlapping lines that might block visibility? For instance, if photographer A is connected to D and E, and photographer B is connected to E and F, does the line from A to E block the line from B to E? Wait, no, because E is a single point, so lines from A and B to E both go to E, but E can see both A and B without any obstruction because the lines from E to A and E to B don't pass through any other photographers. Similarly, lines from A to D and B to E don't interfere with each other because they're going to different points.So, in this case, the visibility graph would indeed be 4-regular, with each photographer connected to four others, and no three photographers colinear, so no obstructions. Therefore, this seems to satisfy the problem's conditions.But let me think if there are any other potential issues. For example, are all the connections non-crossing? In a hexagram, the lines do cross at the center, but since there's no photographer at the center, those crossings don't obstruct visibility. So, that should be fine.Alternatively, if we were to draw this out, we'd have two overlapping triangles, creating a six-pointed star, with each point connected to two others in its own triangle and two others in the opposite triangle. Each connection is a straight line that doesn't pass through any other photographers, so visibility is maintained.Therefore, it seems that such a configuration is indeed possible. So, the answer should be yes, it is possible.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another configuration. Maybe a convex hexagon with certain diagonals drawn. In a convex hexagon, each vertex can see its two adjacent vertices, but to get four connections, we need to add two more diagonals per vertex. However, in a convex hexagon, adding diagonals can sometimes result in lines crossing, which might block visibility. So, we have to be careful.For example, in a convex hexagon, if each vertex connects to the vertex two steps away, that would form a star-like shape inside, but those connections might cross each other. However, if arranged properly, maybe each photographer can see four others without obstruction.Wait, but in a convex hexagon, connecting each vertex to the vertex two steps away would result in a larger triangle inside, but those lines would cross at the center. So, similar to the hexagram idea. But again, if there's no photographer at the center, then the lines just cross there without obstruction. So, each photographer can see their two adjacent ones and the two they're connected to via the diagonals, making four connections each.So, this is essentially the same as the two overlapping triangles idea, just viewed as a convex hexagon with certain diagonals. So, either way, it seems feasible.Alternatively, maybe arranging the photographers in a three-dimensional shape, but as I thought earlier, the problem specifies a field, which is two-dimensional. So, 3D configurations are out of the question.Another thought: maybe using a complete bipartite graph K3,3. In K3,3, each node is connected to three others, but we need each node to have degree four. So, that's not quite enough. Unless we add another connection, but that might complicate things.Wait, K3,3 is a bipartite graph with two sets of three nodes each, and each node connected to all nodes in the other set. So, each node has degree three. If we could add another connection within each set without causing colinearity, maybe we could get degree four. But adding connections within each set might result in colinear points, which would block visibility.For example, if we have two sets of three photographers each, arranged in two triangles, and then connect each photographer to the two in their own triangle, that would make their degree five, which is too much. So, that doesn't seem to work.Alternatively, maybe arranging them in a different bipartite configuration where each photographer can see three in the other set and one in their own set, but that would require some photographers to see others in their own set without obstruction, which might not be possible if they're arranged in a line or something.Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe the two overlapping triangles idea is still the simplest and most straightforward way to achieve the desired configuration.Wait, just to recap: two overlapping triangles (a hexagram) with six photographers at the points. Each photographer is part of one triangle and connected to two others in that triangle and two in the other triangle, all without any three photographers being colinear. Therefore, each can see exactly four others. That seems to satisfy all the conditions.But let me think about whether this is actually a valid visibility graph. I recall that visibility graphs can sometimes have limitations, especially regarding the number of edges and their arrangement. But in this case, since each edge is a straight line that doesn't pass through any other photographers, it should be fine.Another point to consider: in the hexagram, each photographer is connected to four others, but does that mean that each photographer is visible from four others? Yes, because visibility is mutual. So, if photographer A can see photographer B, then photographer B can see photographer A. Therefore, the graph is undirected and symmetric, which is consistent with the problem statement.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about whether any of the connections might be obstructed. For example, in the hexagram, each photographer is connected to two in their own triangle and two in the other. The connections within the triangle are straightforward, as they're just adjacent points. The connections to the other triangle pass through the center, but since there's no photographer at the center, those lines are unobstructed.So, yes, each photographer can indeed see four others without any obstructions. Therefore, this configuration works.Alternatively, if I try to think of another configuration, maybe a pentagon with a point inside, but as I thought earlier, that only gives each outer point three connections. So, that's not enough.Wait, unless I add another point inside. If I have a pentagon with two points inside, maybe each outer point can see two inner points and two adjacent outer points, making four connections. But then, the inner points would have to see five outer points, which is more than four. So, that doesn't work because each inner point would have a higher degree.Alternatively, if I have two inner points, each outer point can see two inner points and two adjacent outer points, making four connections. But each inner point would see all five outer points, which is five connections, exceeding the required four. So, that doesn't work.Hmm, so that approach doesn't seem feasible.Another idea: maybe arranging the photographers in a cube-like structure, but projected onto a plane. But again, in 2D, a cube's projection would have overlapping edges, which might cause visibility issues.Wait, perhaps a different polygon altogether. Maybe a hexagon with certain diagonals drawn. For example, each photographer connects to their two adjacent ones and two others across, but arranged in such a way that those connections don't cross any other photographers.Wait, but in a regular hexagon, connecting each photographer to the one opposite them would mean each has three connections (two adjacent, one opposite). To get four, maybe connect each to two across. But in a regular hexagon, each photographer has only one opposite, so connecting to two across would require connecting to non-opposite points, which might result in lines crossing other photographers.Wait, let me think. In a regular hexagon, each photographer can see their two adjacent ones. If they also connect to the two photographers that are two steps away, that would be four connections. But in a regular hexagon, connecting to the two steps away would mean connecting to the ones that are not opposite but sort of next to opposite. Wait, in a regular hexagon, each photographer has two neighbors, and then the next two are across but not directly opposite.Wait, no, in a regular hexagon, each photographer has one opposite. So, connecting to the two next to the opposite would mean connecting to photographers that are two steps away in one direction and three steps away in the other. Hmm, but in a regular hexagon, the distance is symmetric, so connecting to two steps away in both directions would actually connect to the same photographers.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to visualize a regular hexagon with photographers at each vertex. Each photographer can see their two adjacent ones. If they also connect to the two photographers that are two steps away, that would give them four connections. But in a regular hexagon, connecting to the two steps away would mean connecting to photographers that are not adjacent but also not opposite. However, those lines would pass through the center, which is empty, so they wouldn't be obstructed.Wait, but in a regular hexagon, the lines connecting two steps away don't pass through the center. Let me think. In a regular hexagon, the distance between two steps away is equal to the side length times sqrt(3), but the lines connecting them would actually pass through the center if they're opposite. Wait, no, in a regular hexagon, the opposite points are three steps away, right? So, connecting to two steps away would not pass through the center.Wait, let me clarify. In a regular hexagon, each vertex is connected to its two adjacent vertices by edges of length 's'. The distance to the vertex two steps away is 2s*sin(60°) = s*sqrt(3). The lines connecting two steps away would form a smaller equilateral triangle inside the hexagon, but they wouldn't pass through the center. Instead, the center is where the medians intersect, but those are different lines.Wait, no, actually, in a regular hexagon, the lines connecting opposite vertices pass through the center. So, connecting to two steps away would not pass through the center. So, if each photographer connects to their two adjacent ones and the two that are two steps away, those lines wouldn't pass through any other photographers, so visibility would be maintained.Wait, but hold on. If each photographer connects to their two adjacent ones and the two that are two steps away, that would give them four connections. But in a regular hexagon, connecting to two steps away would mean connecting to two photographers, but those connections would form another hexagon inside? Or maybe a triangle?Wait, no, connecting each photographer to their two adjacent ones and the two two steps away would actually form a star polygon. Specifically, a hexagram, which is the same as the two overlapping triangles I thought of earlier. So, in this case, each photographer is part of a hexagon and connected to two adjacent and two two steps away, forming the same 4-regular graph.Therefore, whether I think of it as two overlapping triangles or a hexagon with certain diagonals, it's essentially the same configuration. So, that seems to confirm that such a configuration is possible.But just to make sure, let me think about whether any of the connections would be obstructed. For example, if photographer A is connected to photographer B (adjacent), C (two steps away), D (opposite), and E (two steps away in the other direction), would any of these lines pass through another photographer?In the regular hexagon, the lines connecting A to C and A to E would pass through the center, but since there's no photographer at the center, those lines are unobstructed. Similarly, the lines connecting A to B and A to F (the other adjacent) are just the edges of the hexagon, which don't pass through any other photographers. So, yes, each photographer can see four others without any obstructions.Therefore, after considering various configurations and verifying that the hexagram or two overlapping triangles setup satisfies the conditions, I can conclude that it is indeed possible to place six photographers in a field such that each can photograph exactly four others.**Final Answer**boxed{Yes}"},{"question":"In acute triangle ABC, sin A= frac {3}{5}, tan (A-B)=- frac {1}{3}, find the value of 3tan C.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about an acute triangle ABC. It says that sin A is 3/5, and tan(A - B) is -1/3. I need to find the value of 3 tan C. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, since it's an acute triangle, all angles are less than 90 degrees. That might be useful later on. I know that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so A + B + C = 180°. That could help me relate the angles once I find some information about them.Given that sin A = 3/5, I can find cos A because in a right triangle, sin²A + cos²A = 1. So, cos²A = 1 - sin²A = 1 - (9/25) = 16/25. Therefore, cos A is 4/5 because cosine is positive in acute angles. So, cos A = 4/5.Now, tan(A - B) is given as -1/3. I remember that tan(A - B) can be expanded using the tangent subtraction formula: tan(A - B) = (tan A - tan B) / (1 + tan A tan B). So, I can write:(tan A - tan B) / (1 + tan A tan B) = -1/3.I need to find tan A and tan B. I already know sin A and cos A, so tan A = sin A / cos A = (3/5) / (4/5) = 3/4. So, tan A is 3/4.Let me denote tan B as t for simplicity. Then, plugging into the formula:(3/4 - t) / (1 + (3/4)t) = -1/3.Now, I can solve for t. Let's set up the equation:(3/4 - t) / (1 + (3/4)t) = -1/3.Cross-multiplying:3(3/4 - t) = -1(1 + (3/4)t).Let me compute both sides:Left side: 3*(3/4) - 3t = 9/4 - 3t.Right side: -1 - (3/4)t.So, the equation becomes:9/4 - 3t = -1 - (3/4)t.Let me bring all terms to one side. I'll add 1 to both sides and add (3/4)t to both sides:9/4 + 1 - 3t + (3/4)t = 0.Wait, actually, maybe it's better to collect like terms step by step.Starting from:9/4 - 3t = -1 - (3/4)t.Let me add 3t to both sides:9/4 = -1 + (3t - (3/4)t).Wait, that might not be the clearest way. Alternatively, let's bring all terms to the left side:9/4 - 3t + 1 + (3/4)t = 0.Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me do it properly.Starting from:9/4 - 3t = -1 - (3/4)t.Add 1 to both sides:9/4 + 1 - 3t = - (3/4)t.Convert 1 to 4/4 to add to 9/4:(9/4 + 4/4) - 3t = - (3/4)t.So, 13/4 - 3t = - (3/4)t.Now, add 3t to both sides:13/4 = 3t - (3/4)t.Factor out t on the right side:13/4 = t*(3 - 3/4).Compute 3 - 3/4: that's 12/4 - 3/4 = 9/4.So, 13/4 = t*(9/4).Multiply both sides by 4/9 to solve for t:t = (13/4)*(4/9) = 13/9.So, tan B = 13/9.Wait, hold on. Is that possible? Because in an acute triangle, all angles are less than 90°, so their tangents should be positive, which is the case here. So, tan B is 13/9.Hmm, okay. So, tan A is 3/4, tan B is 13/9.Now, since the triangle is acute, all angles are less than 90°, so A and B are both acute angles, and so is C.We need to find tan C. Since A + B + C = 180°, then C = 180° - A - B. Therefore, tan C = tan(180° - A - B). But tan(180° - x) = -tan x, so tan C = -tan(A + B).So, tan C = -tan(A + B). Therefore, I can compute tan(A + B) using the tangent addition formula:tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B).Plugging in the values:tan(A + B) = (3/4 + 13/9) / (1 - (3/4)(13/9)).Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.First, numerator:3/4 + 13/9. To add these, find a common denominator, which is 36.3/4 = 27/36, 13/9 = 52/36. So, 27/36 + 52/36 = 79/36.Denominator:1 - (3/4)(13/9). Compute (3/4)(13/9):(3*13)/(4*9) = 39/36 = 13/12.So, 1 - 13/12 = (12/12 - 13/12) = -1/12.Therefore, tan(A + B) = (79/36) / (-1/12) = (79/36) * (-12/1) = (79 * -12) / 36.Simplify:79 * (-12) = -948.-948 / 36 = -26.333... Wait, let me compute that.Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 948 ÷ 12 = 79, 36 ÷ 12 = 3. So, it's -79/3.Therefore, tan(A + B) = -79/3.But tan C = -tan(A + B) = -(-79/3) = 79/3.So, tan C is 79/3.Therefore, 3 tan C = 3*(79/3) = 79.So, the value is 79.Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 79 seems a bit large, but maybe it's correct.First, tan A = 3/4, tan B = 13/9.Compute tan(A + B):(3/4 + 13/9) / (1 - (3/4)(13/9)).Compute numerator:3/4 is 0.75, 13/9 is approximately 1.444. So, 0.75 + 1.444 ≈ 2.194.Denominator:1 - (3/4)(13/9) = 1 - (39/36) = 1 - 1.083 ≈ -0.083.So, approximately, tan(A + B) ≈ 2.194 / (-0.083) ≈ -26.433.Which is approximately -79/3 because 79 divided by 3 is approximately 26.333. So, that matches. So, tan C is 79/3, so 3 tan C is 79.Therefore, the answer is 79.But just to make sure, let me check all steps again.1. sin A = 3/5, so cos A = 4/5, so tan A = 3/4. Correct.2. tan(A - B) = -1/3. Using the formula:(tan A - tan B)/(1 + tan A tan B) = -1/3.Plugging tan A = 3/4, let tan B = t.So, (3/4 - t)/(1 + (3/4)t) = -1/3.Cross-multiplying: 3*(3/4 - t) = -1*(1 + (3/4)t).Compute left: 9/4 - 3t.Right: -1 - (3/4)t.Bring all terms to left:9/4 - 3t + 1 + (3/4)t = 0.Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, let me do it again.From 9/4 - 3t = -1 - (3/4)t.Add 1 to both sides: 9/4 + 1 - 3t = - (3/4)t.Convert 1 to 4/4: 13/4 - 3t = - (3/4)t.Add 3t to both sides: 13/4 = (3t - (3/4)t).Factor t: 13/4 = t*(3 - 3/4) = t*(9/4).So, t = (13/4)*(4/9) = 13/9. Correct.So, tan B = 13/9.Then, tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B)/(1 - tan A tan B).Compute numerator: 3/4 + 13/9 = (27 + 52)/36 = 79/36.Denominator: 1 - (3/4)(13/9) = 1 - 39/36 = 1 - 13/12 = -1/12.So, tan(A + B) = (79/36)/(-1/12) = (79/36)*(-12/1) = -79/3.Thus, tan C = -tan(A + B) = 79/3.Therefore, 3 tan C = 79.Yes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 79.**Final Answer**The value of (3 tan C) is boxed{79})."},{"question":"A four-digit palindrome is defined as any four-digit natural number that has the same digit in the units place as in the thousands place, and the same digit in the tens place as in the hundreds place.

So, we need to find two four-digit palindromes, let's call them P and Q, where P - Q = 3674. First, let me represent a four-digit palindrome mathematically. If the palindrome is ABBA, then it can be expressed as:P = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*B + A = 1001*A + 110*BSimilarly, another palindrome Q can be written as:Q = 1001*C + 110*DWhere A, B, C, D are digits (0-9), and since they are four-digit numbers, A and C cannot be zero.So, the difference P - Q is:P - Q = (1001*A + 110*B) - (1001*C + 110*D) = 1001*(A - C) + 110*(B - D)We are told that this difference is 3674, so:1001*(A - C) + 110*(B - D) = 3674Hmm, okay. Let me note that 1001 and 110 have a common factor. Let me check: 1001 divided by 11 is 91, and 110 divided by 11 is 10. So, 11 is a common factor. Let me factor that out:11*(91*(A - C) + 10*(B - D)) = 3674So, 3674 divided by 11 is equal to 91*(A - C) + 10*(B - D). Let me compute 3674 divided by 11.3674 ÷ 11: 11*334 = 3674, right? Because 11*300=3300, 11*34=374, so 3300+374=3674. So, 3674 ÷ 11 = 334.Therefore, we have:91*(A - C) + 10*(B - D) = 334So, now, we have the equation:91*(A - C) + 10*(B - D) = 334Our variables here are A, B, C, D, all digits (0-9), with A and C being at least 1 (since they are the first digits of four-digit numbers).So, let me denote:Let x = A - CLet y = B - DThen, the equation becomes:91x + 10y = 334We need to find integer solutions (x, y) where x and y are integers such that A, B, C, D are digits (0-9), with A and C at least 1.So, x can be from (1 - 9) to (9 - 1) = -8 to 8, but since A and C are digits, x can be from -8 to 8.Similarly, y can be from -9 to 9.So, we need to solve 91x + 10y = 334 for integers x and y within these ranges.Let me solve for y:10y = 334 - 91xSo,y = (334 - 91x)/10Since y must be an integer, (334 - 91x) must be divisible by 10. That is, 334 - 91x ≡ 0 mod 10.Compute 334 mod 10: 4Compute 91 mod 10: 1So, 4 - x ≡ 0 mod 10Therefore,-x ≡ -4 mod 10Which implies,x ≡ 4 mod 10But x is between -8 and 8, so possible x values are 4 and -6 (since 4 - 10 = -6). Wait, 4 + 10 is 14, which is beyond 8, so only x = 4 and x = -6.Wait, let me check:x ≡ 4 mod 10, so possible x in the range -8 to 8 are x = 4 and x = -6 (since -6 ≡ 4 mod 10 because -6 + 10 = 4). So, x can be 4 or -6.Let me check x = 4:Then, y = (334 - 91*4)/10 = (334 - 364)/10 = (-30)/10 = -3So, y = -3So, x = 4, y = -3Check if these are within the allowed ranges:x = 4: A - C = 4. Since A and C are digits from 1-9, A must be at least C + 4. So, A can be from 5 to 9, and C can be from 1 to A - 4.Similarly, y = -3: B - D = -3, so D = B + 3. Since B and D are digits from 0-9, B can be from 0 to 6, and D will be from 3 to 9.Now, x = -6:Then, y = (334 - 91*(-6))/10 = (334 + 546)/10 = 880/10 = 88But y = 88 is way beyond the possible range of y, which is from -9 to 9. So, y = 88 is invalid. Therefore, x = -6 is not a valid solution.Therefore, the only possible solution is x = 4 and y = -3.So, now, we have:A - C = 4B - D = -3So, we can now find the number of possible pairs (P, Q) such that P - Q = 3674.Since P and Q are four-digit palindromes, P = ABBA and Q = CDDC (since D = B + 3).Wait, no, Q is CDDC? Wait, Q is a palindrome, so Q = CDDC? Wait, no, Q is also a four-digit palindrome, so it's C D D C.Wait, no, hold on. Wait, Q is a four-digit palindrome, so it's C D D C? Wait, no, wait, if Q is C D D C, then it's a palindrome. But in our earlier notation, Q = C D D C, which is 1001*C + 110*D.Wait, but in the difference, we have:P - Q = (1001*A + 110*B) - (1001*C + 110*D) = 1001*(A - C) + 110*(B - D) = 3674Which led us to x = A - C = 4, y = B - D = -3.So, A = C + 4B = D - 3So, since A and C are digits from 1-9, and B and D are digits from 0-9.So, let's find the number of possible (A, C) pairs:A = C + 4C can be from 1 to 5 (since A must be at most 9, so C + 4 ≤ 9 => C ≤ 5). So, C can be 1,2,3,4,5, which gives A as 5,6,7,8,9 respectively.So, 5 possible (A, C) pairs.Similarly, for B and D:B = D - 3So, D = B + 3Since D must be a digit (0-9), B can be from 0 to 6 (since 6 + 3 = 9). So, B can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, which gives D as 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 respectively.So, 7 possible (B, D) pairs.Therefore, the total number of pairs (P, Q) is the number of (A, C) pairs multiplied by the number of (B, D) pairs, which is 5 * 7 = 35.But wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me think.Each pair (A, C) and (B, D) defines a unique pair of palindromes (P, Q). So, since there are 5 choices for (A, C) and 7 choices for (B, D), the total number of such pairs is indeed 5*7=35.But let me double-check if all these pairs satisfy that P - Q = 3674.So, for each (A, C) pair, A = C + 4, and for each (B, D) pair, D = B + 3.So, let's take an example:Let C = 1, so A = 5.Let B = 0, so D = 3.Then, P = 5 0 0 5 = 5005Q = 1 3 3 1 = 1331Compute P - Q: 5005 - 1331 = 3674. Correct.Another example:C = 5, A = 9B = 6, D = 9P = 9 6 6 9 = 9669Q = 5 9 9 5 = 5995Compute P - Q: 9669 - 5995 = 3674. Correct.Another example:C = 3, A = 7B = 2, D = 5P = 7 2 2 7 = 7227Q = 3 5 5 3 = 35537227 - 3553 = 3674. Correct.So, seems consistent.Therefore, the total number of such pairs is 35.Wait, but hold on. Is there any restriction on Q? Since Q is a four-digit palindrome, C cannot be zero. But in our earlier consideration, C starts from 1, so that's fine.Similarly, D is from 3 to 9, which is fine because D is a digit.B is from 0 to 6, which is fine.So, all these pairs are valid four-digit palindromes.Therefore, the answer is 35.But wait, hold on, the problem says \\"pairs of four-digit palindromes\\". So, does that mean ordered pairs or unordered pairs? Hmm.In the problem statement, it says \\"pairs of four-digit palindromes exist whose difference is 3674\\". So, it's about two palindromes P and Q such that P - Q = 3674. So, each such pair is ordered, because P is larger than Q. So, the number of ordered pairs is 35.But if the problem had meant unordered pairs, it would be the same as the number of ordered pairs, because each unordered pair {P, Q} corresponds to exactly one ordered pair (P, Q) with P > Q. So, in that case, it's still 35.But let me check the problem statement again:\\"How many pairs of four-digit palindromes exist whose difference is 3674?\\"It doesn't specify ordered or unordered, but in combinatorics, \\"pairs\\" can sometimes mean unordered. However, since the difference is specified as 3674, which is positive, it implies that P > Q, so it's an ordered pair. So, the count is 35.Wait, but let me think again. If we consider unordered pairs, then each pair {P, Q} is counted once, regardless of order. But in our case, since P - Q = 3674, each such pair is unique because P must be larger than Q. So, the number of unordered pairs is equal to the number of ordered pairs where P > Q, which is 35.But in the problem statement, it's not clear. However, in the context of differences, it's usually considered as ordered pairs because difference is directional. So, I think 35 is the correct answer.But wait, hold on. Let me check if all these pairs are distinct. For example, is there a case where two different (A, C) and (B, D) could result in the same pair (P, Q)? I don't think so because each (A, C) and (B, D) uniquely defines P and Q. So, each combination gives a unique pair.Therefore, the total number is 35.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again about the equation:We had 91x + 10y = 334We found x = 4, y = -3 as the only solution.But wait, is that the only solution? Let me check.We had x ≡ 4 mod 10, so x could be 4, 14, 24, etc., but since x is between -8 and 8, only x = 4 and x = -6. But x = -6 gives y = 88, which is invalid. So, only x = 4 is valid.So, yes, only one solution for x and y.Therefore, the number of pairs is 5 * 7 = 35.Hence, the answer is 35.**Final Answer**The number of pairs is boxed{35}."},{"question":"Given (a_0 > 1), the sequence (a_0, a_1, a_2, ...) is such that for all (k > 0), (a_k) is the smallest integer greater than (a_{k-1}) which is relatively prime to all the earlier terms in the sequence. Find all (a_0) for which all terms of the sequence are primes or prime powers.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all starting values ( a_0 > 1 ) such that the sequence ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots ) consists entirely of primes or prime powers. The rule for the sequence is that each term ( a_k ) is the smallest integer greater than ( a_{k-1} ) that is relatively prime to all the previous terms. Hmm, interesting.Let me try to understand the sequence first. Starting with ( a_0 ), each subsequent term is the smallest number bigger than the previous one that doesn't share any common factors with any of the earlier terms. So, if ( a_0 ) is a prime, say 2, then ( a_1 ) would be 3, since it's the next prime and relatively prime to 2. Then ( a_2 ) would be 5, because 4 is not relatively prime to 2, so we skip it. Then ( a_3 ) would be 7, and so on. So in this case, the sequence is just the sequence of primes.But wait, the problem says the terms can be primes or prime powers. So, if ( a_0 ) is a prime power, say 4, then ( a_1 ) would be 5, since 5 is the smallest number greater than 4 that's relatively prime to 4. Then ( a_2 ) would be 7, because 6 is not relatively prime to 4 (since 6 and 4 share a factor of 2). So again, the sequence seems to follow primes.But hold on, maybe if ( a_0 ) is a composite number that's not a prime power, like 6, then the sequence might behave differently. Let's test that.If ( a_0 = 6 ), then ( a_1 ) has to be the smallest integer greater than 6 that's relatively prime to 6. The numbers after 6 are 7, 8, 9, etc. 7 is relatively prime to 6, so ( a_1 = 7 ). Then ( a_2 ) has to be the smallest number greater than 7 that's relatively prime to both 6 and 7. The next number is 8, which is not relatively prime to 6 (since 8 and 6 share a factor of 2). Then 9: 9 and 6 share a factor of 3, so not relatively prime. 10: shares a factor of 2 with 6. 11: relatively prime to both 6 and 7, so ( a_2 = 11 ). Then ( a_3 ) would be 13, since 12 shares factors with 6, 14 shares with 6, 15 shares with 6, 16 shares with 6, 17 is prime, so 17. Wait, but 17 is a prime, so that's fine.But wait, ( a_0 = 6 ) is composite, but not a prime power. So in this case, the sequence is 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. So all terms after ( a_0 ) are primes, but ( a_0 ) itself is composite, so does that violate the condition? The problem says all terms of the sequence are primes or prime powers. Since 6 is a composite number that's not a prime power, it's not allowed. So ( a_0 ) must be a prime or a prime power.Wait, but 6 is not a prime power, so ( a_0 = 6 ) is invalid. So, perhaps only starting with a prime or a prime power is allowed.But let me test another starting value. Let's say ( a_0 = 4 ), which is a prime power (2^2). Then ( a_1 ) is 5, as before. Then ( a_2 = 7 ), ( a_3 = 11 ), etc. So the sequence is 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. All primes or prime powers. So 4 is okay.What about ( a_0 = 8 ), which is 2^3. Then ( a_1 ) is 9? Wait, 9 is not relatively prime to 8? Wait, 9 and 8 are relatively prime because 9 is 3^2 and 8 is 2^3, so gcd(8,9)=1. So ( a_1 = 9 ). Then ( a_2 ) is the smallest number greater than 9 that's relatively prime to both 8 and 9. Let's see: 10 shares a factor with 8 (2), 11 is prime, so 11 is relatively prime to both 8 and 9. So ( a_2 = 11 ). Then ( a_3 = 13 ), ( a_4 = 17 ), etc. So the sequence is 8, 9, 11, 13, 17, etc. All primes or prime powers.Wait, but 9 is a prime power, so that's fine. So ( a_0 = 8 ) is acceptable.What about ( a_0 = 9 )? Then ( a_1 ) is 10? Wait, 10 is not relatively prime to 9? 10 and 9 are relatively prime because 10 is 2*5 and 9 is 3^2, so gcd(9,10)=1. So ( a_1 = 10 ). But 10 is not a prime power; it's composite. So that violates the condition because 10 is neither prime nor prime power. So ( a_0 = 9 ) is invalid.Wait, so starting with 9 leads to a term that's not a prime or prime power. Therefore, ( a_0 = 9 ) is not acceptable.Similarly, let's try ( a_0 = 16 ). Then ( a_1 ) is 17, which is prime. Then ( a_2 ) is 19, since 18 shares a factor with 16 (2). So 19 is prime. Then ( a_3 = 23 ), and so on. So the sequence is 16, 17, 19, 23, etc., all primes or prime powers. So 16 is acceptable.Wait, but what about ( a_0 = 25 ). Then ( a_1 ) is 26? 26 is not relatively prime to 25? 26 and 25 are relatively prime because 26 is 2*13 and 25 is 5^2, so gcd(25,26)=1. So ( a_1 = 26 ). But 26 is not a prime power; it's composite. So that's invalid. So ( a_0 = 25 ) is not acceptable.Hmm, interesting. So starting with some prime powers leads to a composite number in the sequence, which is not allowed. So maybe only certain prime powers are acceptable as starting points.Wait, let's see. When I started with ( a_0 = 4 ), the next term was 5, which is prime. Then 7, 11, etc. So that worked. Starting with ( a_0 = 8 ), the next term was 9, which is a prime power, then 11, 13, etc. So that worked too. But starting with ( a_0 = 9 ), the next term was 10, which was composite. So that didn't work.Similarly, starting with ( a_0 = 16 ), the next term was 17, which is prime, then 19, etc. So that worked. But starting with ( a_0 = 25 ), the next term was 26, which was composite. So that didn't work.So perhaps the starting prime power must be a power of 2? Because 4, 8, 16 are powers of 2, and starting with them seems to work, but starting with other prime powers like 9, 25, etc., leads to composite numbers in the sequence.Wait, let me test ( a_0 = 3 ). Since 3 is a prime, so it's a prime power. Then ( a_1 ) is 4, which is a prime power (2^2). Then ( a_2 ) is 5, which is prime. Then ( a_3 = 7 ), ( a_4 = 11 ), etc. So the sequence is 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, etc. All primes or prime powers. So that works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 2 ). Then ( a_1 = 3 ), ( a_2 = 5 ), etc. All primes. So that works.What about ( a_0 = 5 ). Then ( a_1 = 6 ). 6 is not a prime power, so that's invalid. So starting with 5 leads to 6, which is composite. So ( a_0 = 5 ) is invalid.Wait, that's unexpected. So starting with 5, which is a prime, leads to 6, which is composite. So 5 is invalid as a starting point.Wait, let me check that again. If ( a_0 = 5 ), then ( a_1 ) is the smallest integer greater than 5 that's relatively prime to 5. So 6 is the next number. 6 and 5 are relatively prime, so ( a_1 = 6 ). But 6 is not a prime power, so the sequence would include 6, which is invalid. Therefore, ( a_0 = 5 ) is invalid.Wait, but earlier when I started with ( a_0 = 3 ), ( a_1 = 4 ), which is a prime power, so that was okay. So why is 5 different?Because 5 is a prime, but the next number after 5 is 6, which is composite. But in the case of 3, the next number is 4, which is a prime power.So, perhaps only certain primes can be starting points. Let's see.If ( a_0 = 2 ), then ( a_1 = 3 ), which is prime. Then ( a_2 = 5 ), etc. So that works.If ( a_0 = 3 ), ( a_1 = 4 ), which is a prime power, then ( a_2 = 5 ), etc. So that works.If ( a_0 = 5 ), ( a_1 = 6 ), which is composite. So that doesn't work.Similarly, ( a_0 = 7 ). Then ( a_1 = 8 ), which is a prime power (2^3). Then ( a_2 = 9 ), which is a prime power (3^2). Then ( a_3 = 11 ), which is prime. Then ( a_4 = 13 ), etc. So the sequence is 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, etc. All primes or prime powers. So ( a_0 = 7 ) is acceptable.Wait, so 7 is a prime, and starting with 7, the next term is 8, which is a prime power, then 9, which is a prime power, then 11, etc. So that works.Wait, but earlier, starting with 5 led to 6, which was composite. So why is 7 different?Because after 7, the next number is 8, which is a prime power, but after 5, the next number is 6, which is composite.So perhaps primes where the next number is a prime power can be starting points, but others cannot.So, let's try to find all primes ( p ) such that ( p + 1 ) is a prime power.Because if ( a_0 = p ), then ( a_1 ) is the smallest number greater than ( p ) that's relatively prime to ( p ). Since ( p ) is prime, the next number is ( p + 1 ), which must be relatively prime to ( p ). Since ( p ) is prime, ( p + 1 ) is relatively prime to ( p ) unless ( p + 1 ) is a multiple of ( p ), which only happens when ( p = 2 ), because 2 + 1 = 3, which is not a multiple of 2. Wait, actually, for any prime ( p ), ( p + 1 ) is not a multiple of ( p ), because ( p + 1 ) mod ( p ) is 1. So ( p + 1 ) is always relatively prime to ( p ).Therefore, ( a_1 = p + 1 ). So for ( a_1 ) to be a prime power, ( p + 1 ) must be a prime power.So, for ( a_0 = p ) to be acceptable, ( p + 1 ) must be a prime power.So, let's find all primes ( p ) such that ( p + 1 ) is a prime power.Let me list some primes and check:- ( p = 2 ): ( p + 1 = 3 ), which is prime. So 3 is a prime power. So 2 is acceptable.- ( p = 3 ): ( p + 1 = 4 ), which is ( 2^2 ), a prime power. So 3 is acceptable.- ( p = 5 ): ( p + 1 = 6 ), which is not a prime power. So 5 is not acceptable.- ( p = 7 ): ( p + 1 = 8 ), which is ( 2^3 ), a prime power. So 7 is acceptable.- ( p = 11 ): ( p + 1 = 12 ), not a prime power.- ( p = 13 ): ( p + 1 = 14 ), not a prime power.- ( p = 17 ): ( p + 1 = 18 ), not a prime power.- ( p = 19 ): ( p + 1 = 20 ), not a prime power.- ( p = 23 ): ( p + 1 = 24 ), not a prime power.- ( p = 29 ): ( p + 1 = 30 ), not a prime power.- ( p = 31 ): ( p + 1 = 32 ), which is ( 2^5 ), a prime power. So 31 is acceptable.Wait, 31 is a prime, and 32 is a prime power. So 31 is acceptable.Similarly, ( p = 3 ): 4 is a prime power.So, the primes ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a prime power are 2, 3, 7, 31, etc. Wait, 31 + 1 = 32 = 2^5. Then, what's next?Let me check ( p = 127 ): ( p + 1 = 128 = 2^7 ). So 127 is a prime, and 128 is a prime power. So 127 is acceptable.Similarly, ( p = 8191 ): ( p + 1 = 8192 = 2^{13} ). So 8191 is a prime, and 8192 is a prime power. So 8191 is acceptable.Wait, so these are primes of the form ( 2^n - 1 ), which are Mersenne primes. Because if ( p + 1 = 2^n ), then ( p = 2^n - 1 ). So, Mersenne primes.So, primes ( p ) such that ( p + 1 ) is a power of 2. These are exactly the Mersenne primes.So, Mersenne primes are primes of the form ( 2^n - 1 ). So, for example, 3 = 2^2 - 1, 7 = 2^3 - 1, 31 = 2^5 - 1, 127 = 2^7 - 1, etc.Therefore, if ( a_0 ) is a Mersenne prime, then ( a_1 = 2^n ), which is a prime power, and then the sequence continues with primes or prime powers.But wait, let's check ( a_0 = 7 ). Then ( a_1 = 8 ), which is 2^3. Then ( a_2 ) is the smallest number greater than 8 that's relatively prime to both 7 and 8. So, 9 is next. 9 is 3^2, which is a prime power. Then ( a_3 = 11 ), which is prime. Then ( a_4 = 13 ), etc. So that works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 31 ). Then ( a_1 = 32 ), which is 2^5. Then ( a_2 = 33 ). Wait, 33 is not relatively prime to 32? 33 and 32 are relatively prime because 33 is 3*11 and 32 is 2^5. So, ( a_2 = 33 ). But 33 is not a prime power; it's composite. So that's a problem.Wait, so starting with ( a_0 = 31 ), the sequence would be 31, 32, 33, ... but 33 is composite, which violates the condition. So, ( a_0 = 31 ) is invalid.Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, maybe my assumption that all Mersenne primes would work is incorrect.Wait, let's go through it step by step. ( a_0 = 31 ). Then ( a_1 = 32 ), which is a prime power. Then ( a_2 ) is the smallest integer greater than 32 that's relatively prime to both 31 and 32. So, 33 is next. 33 is relatively prime to 31 (since 33 and 31 are coprime) and to 32 (since 33 is odd, so gcd(33,32)=1). So, ( a_2 = 33 ). But 33 is 3*11, which is composite, not a prime power. So, that's invalid.Therefore, ( a_0 = 31 ) is invalid. So, my earlier conclusion was wrong. So, only certain Mersenne primes might work.Wait, let's check ( a_0 = 7 ). Then ( a_1 = 8 ), ( a_2 = 9 ), which is a prime power, ( a_3 = 11 ), etc. So, that works.But ( a_0 = 31 ) leads to ( a_2 = 33 ), which is composite. So, why is 7 different?Because after 8, the next number is 9, which is a prime power. But after 32, the next number is 33, which is composite.So, perhaps the next number after the prime power must also be a prime power. So, for ( a_1 = 2^n ), ( a_2 ) must be a prime power.So, ( a_2 ) is the smallest number greater than ( 2^n ) that's relatively prime to all previous terms, which are ( a_0 = 2^n - 1 ) (a prime) and ( a_1 = 2^n ). So, the next number after ( 2^n ) is ( 2^n + 1 ). Is ( 2^n + 1 ) a prime power?For ( n = 2 ): ( 2^2 + 1 = 5 ), which is prime.For ( n = 3 ): ( 2^3 + 1 = 9 ), which is 3^2, a prime power.For ( n = 5 ): ( 2^5 + 1 = 33 ), which is 3*11, not a prime power.For ( n = 7 ): ( 2^7 + 1 = 129 ), which is 3*43, not a prime power.So, only for ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 3 ), ( 2^n + 1 ) is a prime power. For higher ( n ), it's composite.Therefore, only when ( n = 2 ) or ( n = 3 ), which correspond to ( a_0 = 3 ) and ( a_0 = 7 ), does the sequence continue with prime powers.Wait, so if ( a_0 = 3 ), ( a_1 = 4 ), ( a_2 = 5 ), which is prime. Then ( a_3 = 7 ), etc. So, that works.If ( a_0 = 7 ), ( a_1 = 8 ), ( a_2 = 9 ), which is a prime power, then ( a_3 = 11 ), etc. So that works.But for ( a_0 = 31 ), ( a_1 = 32 ), ( a_2 = 33 ), which is composite, so that doesn't work.Similarly, ( a_0 = 127 ), ( a_1 = 128 ), ( a_2 = 129 ), which is 3*43, composite.So, only ( a_0 = 3 ) and ( a_0 = 7 ) work in this case.Wait, but what about ( a_0 = 2 ). Then ( a_1 = 3 ), which is prime, ( a_2 = 5 ), which is prime, etc. So that works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 4 ). Then ( a_1 = 5 ), which is prime, ( a_2 = 7 ), etc. So that works.( a_0 = 8 ). Then ( a_1 = 9 ), which is a prime power, ( a_2 = 11 ), etc. So that works.( a_0 = 16 ). Then ( a_1 = 17 ), which is prime, ( a_2 = 19 ), etc. So that works.Wait, so starting with ( a_0 = 2 ), 3, 4, 7, 8, 16, etc., seems to work.Wait, let me try ( a_0 = 16 ). Then ( a_1 = 17 ), which is prime. Then ( a_2 = 19 ), since 18 shares a factor with 16 (2). So, 19 is prime. Then ( a_3 = 23 ), etc. So, all primes or prime powers.Similarly, ( a_0 = 32 ). Then ( a_1 = 33 ), which is composite. So, ( a_0 = 32 ) is invalid.Wait, so ( a_0 = 32 ) is invalid because ( a_1 = 33 ) is composite. So, 32 is not acceptable.Wait, so perhaps only certain powers of 2 are acceptable as starting points.Let me see:- ( a_0 = 2 ): works.- ( a_0 = 4 ): works.- ( a_0 = 8 ): works.- ( a_0 = 16 ): works.- ( a_0 = 32 ): doesn't work because ( a_1 = 33 ) is composite.Wait, so why does ( a_0 = 16 ) work? Because ( a_1 = 17 ), which is prime. Then ( a_2 = 19 ), etc.But ( a_0 = 32 ) leads to ( a_1 = 33 ), which is composite.So, what's the difference between 16 and 32?After 16, the next number is 17, which is prime. After 32, the next number is 33, which is composite.So, perhaps only when ( a_0 = 2^n ) where ( 2^n + 1 ) is prime.Wait, ( 2^n + 1 ) is prime only for certain ( n ). These are known as Fermat primes.Fermat primes are primes of the form ( 2^{2^k} + 1 ). Known Fermat primes are for ( k = 0 ) to ( 4 ):- ( k = 0 ): 3- ( k = 1 ): 5- ( k = 2 ): 17- ( k = 3 ): 257- ( k = 4 ): 65537These are the known Fermat primes, and it's known that for ( k geq 5 ), no Fermat primes are known, and it's conjectured that there are no more.So, if ( a_0 = 2^n ), then ( a_1 = 2^n + 1 ). For ( a_1 ) to be a prime, ( 2^n + 1 ) must be prime. Which happens only when ( n ) is a power of 2, i.e., ( n = 2^k ), making ( 2^{2^k} + 1 ) a Fermat prime.So, for ( a_0 = 2^{2^k} ), ( a_1 ) is a Fermat prime, which is prime. Then, ( a_2 ) is the next prime, etc.But wait, let's test ( a_0 = 16 ), which is ( 2^4 ). Then ( a_1 = 17 ), which is prime. Then ( a_2 = 19 ), which is prime. So that works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 256 ) (which is ( 2^8 )). Then ( a_1 = 257 ), which is prime. Then ( a_2 = 259 ). Wait, 259 is 7*37, which is composite. So, ( a_2 = 259 ) is composite, which violates the condition. So, ( a_0 = 256 ) is invalid.Wait, but 257 is a Fermat prime, but the next number after 257 is 258, which is even, so not relatively prime to 256. Then 259, which is composite. So, ( a_2 = 259 ) is composite. So, ( a_0 = 256 ) is invalid.Wait, so even though ( a_0 = 256 ) leads to ( a_1 = 257 ), which is prime, the next term is composite. So, ( a_0 = 256 ) is invalid.Therefore, only certain powers of 2 work as starting points.Specifically, ( a_0 = 2 ), 4, 8, 16, etc., but only up to a certain point.Wait, let's see:- ( a_0 = 2 ): works.- ( a_0 = 4 ): works.- ( a_0 = 8 ): works.- ( a_0 = 16 ): works.- ( a_0 = 32 ): doesn't work because ( a_1 = 33 ) is composite.Wait, but 32 is ( 2^5 ). So, ( a_1 = 33 ), which is composite.But 16 is ( 2^4 ). ( a_1 = 17 ), which is prime.So, perhaps only when ( a_0 = 2^n ) where ( n ) is such that ( 2^n + 1 ) is prime, i.e., ( n ) is a power of 2, leading to Fermat primes.So, known Fermat primes correspond to ( n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ), etc., but beyond ( n = 16 ), no Fermat primes are known.Therefore, ( a_0 ) can be ( 2^{2^k} ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ), i.e., ( a_0 = 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536 ), etc., but beyond that, it's unknown.But in our problem, we need to find all ( a_0 > 1 ) such that all terms of the sequence are primes or prime powers.From our earlier analysis, starting with ( a_0 = 2 ), 3, 4, 7, 8, 16, etc., seems to work, but starting with higher numbers like 31, 32, 256, etc., leads to composite numbers in the sequence.Wait, but let's think again about ( a_0 = 7 ). Then ( a_1 = 8 ), which is a prime power, ( a_2 = 9 ), which is a prime power, ( a_3 = 11 ), etc. So, that works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 3 ). Then ( a_1 = 4 ), which is a prime power, ( a_2 = 5 ), which is prime, ( a_3 = 7 ), etc. So that works.But ( a_0 = 5 ) leads to ( a_1 = 6 ), which is composite, so invalid.So, perhaps the acceptable starting points are:- All powers of 2 where ( 2^n + 1 ) is prime (i.e., Fermat primes). So, ( a_0 = 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536 ), etc.- All primes ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a prime power. From earlier, these are primes ( p ) such that ( p + 1 ) is a power of 2, i.e., Mersenne primes. But as we saw, starting with Mersenne primes beyond 7 leads to composite numbers in the sequence.Wait, but for ( a_0 = 7 ), ( a_1 = 8 ), which is a prime power, then ( a_2 = 9 ), which is a prime power, then ( a_3 = 11 ), etc. So, that works.But for ( a_0 = 31 ), ( a_1 = 32 ), which is a prime power, then ( a_2 = 33 ), which is composite. So, that doesn't work.So, perhaps only certain Mersenne primes work, specifically those where ( p + 1 ) is a power of 2, and the next number after that power of 2 is also a prime power.Wait, but for ( a_0 = 7 ), ( a_1 = 8 ), ( a_2 = 9 ), which is a prime power. So, that works.For ( a_0 = 31 ), ( a_1 = 32 ), ( a_2 = 33 ), which is composite. So, that doesn't work.So, perhaps only Mersenne primes where ( p + 1 = 2^n ) and ( 2^n + 1 ) is also a prime power.Wait, ( p = 7 ), ( p + 1 = 8 = 2^3 ), then ( 8 + 1 = 9 = 3^2 ), which is a prime power. So, that works.Similarly, ( p = 3 ), ( p + 1 = 4 = 2^2 ), then ( 4 + 1 = 5 ), which is prime. So, that works.But ( p = 31 ), ( p + 1 = 32 = 2^5 ), then ( 32 + 1 = 33 ), which is composite. So, that doesn't work.So, perhaps only Mersenne primes where ( p + 1 = 2^n ) and ( 2^n + 1 ) is a prime power.So, for ( p = 3 ), ( 2^n = 4 ), ( 2^n + 1 = 5 ), which is prime.For ( p = 7 ), ( 2^n = 8 ), ( 2^n + 1 = 9 ), which is a prime power.For ( p = 31 ), ( 2^n = 32 ), ( 2^n + 1 = 33 ), which is composite.So, only ( p = 3 ) and ( p = 7 ) satisfy this condition.Therefore, the acceptable starting points ( a_0 ) are:- All powers of 2 where ( 2^n + 1 ) is prime (Fermat primes). Known ones are ( 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536 ).- Primes ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a power of 2 and ( 2^n + 1 ) is a prime power. These are ( p = 3 ) and ( p = 7 ).Additionally, we saw that starting with ( a_0 = 8 ) (which is ( 2^3 )) leads to ( a_1 = 9 ), which is a prime power, then ( a_2 = 11 ), etc. So, ( a_0 = 8 ) is acceptable.Wait, but 8 is a power of 2, and ( 8 + 1 = 9 ), which is a prime power. So, perhaps 8 is included in the Fermat prime starting points? Wait, no, because 8 is ( 2^3 ), and ( 2^3 + 1 = 9 ), which is a prime power, but 9 is not a prime, it's a prime power. So, perhaps 8 is acceptable because ( a_1 = 9 ) is a prime power.Wait, but earlier, when ( a_0 = 8 ), ( a_1 = 9 ), which is a prime power, then ( a_2 = 11 ), which is prime, etc. So, that works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 16 ), ( a_1 = 17 ), which is prime, then ( a_2 = 19 ), etc. So, that works.But ( a_0 = 32 ), ( a_1 = 33 ), which is composite, so invalid.So, perhaps the acceptable starting points are:- All powers of 2 where ( 2^n + 1 ) is a prime power. So, ( 2^n + 1 ) can be prime or a prime power.Wait, for ( a_0 = 8 ), ( 8 + 1 = 9 ), which is a prime power. So, that's acceptable.For ( a_0 = 16 ), ( 16 + 1 = 17 ), which is prime. So, that's acceptable.For ( a_0 = 4 ), ( 4 + 1 = 5 ), which is prime.For ( a_0 = 2 ), ( 2 + 1 = 3 ), which is prime.For ( a_0 = 3 ), ( 3 + 1 = 4 ), which is a prime power.For ( a_0 = 7 ), ( 7 + 1 = 8 ), which is a prime power.So, in general, ( a_0 ) can be:- Any prime ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a prime power.- Any prime power ( q ) where ( q + 1 ) is a prime power.Wait, but ( q ) must be a prime power, and ( q + 1 ) must also be a prime power.So, let's consider both cases:1. ( a_0 ) is a prime ( p ), and ( p + 1 ) is a prime power.2. ( a_0 ) is a prime power ( q ), and ( q + 1 ) is a prime power.So, for case 1:Primes ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a prime power. These are primes ( p ) such that ( p + 1 = 2^n ) or ( p + 1 = 3^n ), etc.But as we saw earlier, for ( p + 1 = 2^n ), these are Mersenne primes. But only certain Mersenne primes work because the next term after ( 2^n ) must also be a prime power.Wait, but for ( a_0 = 3 ), ( p + 1 = 4 = 2^2 ), which is a prime power, and then ( a_1 = 4 ), which is a prime power, and ( a_2 = 5 ), which is prime.Similarly, ( a_0 = 7 ), ( p + 1 = 8 = 2^3 ), which is a prime power, then ( a_1 = 8 ), which is a prime power, ( a_2 = 9 = 3^2 ), which is a prime power, ( a_3 = 11 ), etc.But for ( a_0 = 31 ), ( p + 1 = 32 = 2^5 ), which is a prime power, but ( a_1 = 32 ), ( a_2 = 33 ), which is composite.So, only certain primes ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a prime power, and ( (p + 1) + 1 ) is also a prime power.Wait, but that seems too restrictive. Maybe the condition is that ( a_0 ) is a prime or a prime power, and ( a_0 + 1 ) is a prime power, and ( a_0 + 2 ) is a prime power, etc., but that seems too much.Alternatively, perhaps the sequence can continue indefinitely with primes or prime powers only if ( a_0 ) is a power of 2 or a prime such that ( a_0 + 1 ) is a power of 2.Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the only starting points that work are the powers of 2 and the primes 3 and 7.Because:- Starting with ( a_0 = 2 ): works.- ( a_0 = 3 ): works.- ( a_0 = 4 ): works.- ( a_0 = 7 ): works.- ( a_0 = 8 ): works.- ( a_0 = 16 ): works.But starting with higher powers of 2 like 32, 64, etc., lead to composite numbers in the sequence.Similarly, starting with higher Mersenne primes like 31, 127, etc., lead to composite numbers.So, perhaps the only acceptable starting points are ( a_0 = 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16 ).Wait, let me check ( a_0 = 16 ). Then ( a_1 = 17 ), which is prime, ( a_2 = 19 ), which is prime, ( a_3 = 23 ), etc. So, that works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 8 ): 8, 9, 11, 13, etc. All primes or prime powers.( a_0 = 4 ): 4, 5, 7, 11, etc.( a_0 = 3 ): 3, 4, 5, 7, etc.( a_0 = 2 ): 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.So, these all work.But what about ( a_0 = 9 )? As before, ( a_1 = 10 ), which is composite. So, invalid.Similarly, ( a_0 = 5 ): ( a_1 = 6 ), composite.( a_0 = 6 ): ( a_1 = 7 ), but ( a_0 = 6 ) is composite, so invalid.So, the acceptable starting points are:- ( a_0 = 2 )- ( a_0 = 3 )- ( a_0 = 4 )- ( a_0 = 7 )- ( a_0 = 8 )- ( a_0 = 16 )Wait, but what about ( a_0 = 256 )? As before, ( a_1 = 257 ), which is prime, ( a_2 = 259 ), which is composite. So, invalid.Similarly, ( a_0 = 65536 ): ( a_1 = 65537 ), which is prime, ( a_2 = 65539 ), which is prime? Wait, 65539 is actually a prime. Let me check.Wait, 65537 is a known prime (a Fermat prime). Then, ( a_2 ) would be the smallest number greater than 65537 that's relatively prime to both 65536 and 65537. The next number is 65538, which is even, so not relatively prime to 65536. Then 65539. Is 65539 prime?Yes, 65539 is a prime number. So, ( a_2 = 65539 ). Then ( a_3 = 65543 ), which is also prime. So, perhaps ( a_0 = 65536 ) works.Wait, but I thought 65539 was composite, but actually, it's prime. So, maybe ( a_0 = 65536 ) is acceptable.Wait, let me confirm:65536 is ( 2^{16} ). Then ( a_1 = 65537 ), which is prime. Then ( a_2 ) is the smallest number greater than 65537 that's relatively prime to both 65536 and 65537. Since 65536 is a power of 2, any odd number is relatively prime to it. 65537 is prime, so the next number after 65537 is 65538, which is even, so not relatively prime to 65536. Then 65539, which is odd. Is 65539 relatively prime to 65537? Yes, because 65537 is prime, and 65539 is not a multiple of it. So, ( a_2 = 65539 ), which is prime. Then ( a_3 = 65543 ), which is prime, and so on.So, ( a_0 = 65536 ) works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 256 ): ( a_1 = 257 ), which is prime, ( a_2 = 259 ), which is composite. So, invalid.Wait, but 257 is prime, and 259 is 7*37, composite. So, ( a_0 = 256 ) is invalid.So, perhaps only certain powers of 2 work, specifically those where ( 2^n + 1 ) is a Fermat prime, and the next number after that is also prime.Wait, but for ( a_0 = 65536 ), ( a_1 = 65537 ), which is prime, and ( a_2 = 65539 ), which is also prime. So, that works.Similarly, ( a_0 = 256 ), ( a_1 = 257 ), prime, ( a_2 = 259 ), composite.So, perhaps only when ( 2^n + 1 ) is a Fermat prime and ( 2^n + 2 ) is also prime.Wait, but 65537 + 1 = 65538 is even, so not prime. Wait, no, ( a_2 = 65539 ), which is 65537 + 2.Wait, perhaps the condition is that ( 2^n + 1 ) is a Fermat prime, and ( 2^n + 2 ) is also prime.But 65537 + 2 = 65539, which is prime.Similarly, 257 + 2 = 259, which is composite.So, only when ( 2^n + 2 ) is prime.But 2^n + 2 is prime only for certain n.For n=1: 4, which is composite.n=2: 6, composite.n=3: 10, composite.n=4: 18, composite.n=5: 34, composite.n=8: 258, composite.n=16: 65538, which is even, composite.Wait, but 65537 + 2 = 65539 is prime, but 65536 + 2 = 65538 is even.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Perhaps the key is that for ( a_0 = 2^{2^k} ), ( a_1 = 2^{2^k} + 1 ) is a Fermat prime, and ( a_2 = 2^{2^k} + 2 ) is prime.But in the case of ( a_0 = 65536 ), ( a_1 = 65537 ), and ( a_2 = 65539 ), which is prime.But for ( a_0 = 256 ), ( a_1 = 257 ), ( a_2 = 259 ), which is composite.So, perhaps only when ( 2^{2^k} + 2 ) is prime.But I don't think that's a standard form.Alternatively, perhaps the only acceptable starting points are ( a_0 = 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16, 256, 65536 ), etc., but only up to a certain point where the sequence continues with primes or prime powers.But given that beyond ( a_0 = 16 ), the sequence may fail, except for ( a_0 = 65536 ), which seems to work.But I'm not sure if there are more such numbers.Wait, perhaps the only acceptable starting points are ( a_0 = 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16 ).Because:- ( a_0 = 2 ): works.- ( a_0 = 3 ): works.- ( a_0 = 4 ): works.- ( a_0 = 7 ): works.- ( a_0 = 8 ): works.- ( a_0 = 16 ): works.But ( a_0 = 256 ): fails because ( a_2 = 259 ) is composite.Similarly, ( a_0 = 65536 ): works because ( a_2 = 65539 ) is prime.But I don't know if 65539 is the next prime after 65537, but in any case, it's prime.Wait, but 65537 is a prime, and 65539 is the next prime after 65537.Wait, no, 65537 is a prime, and 65538 is even, 65539 is prime.So, ( a_0 = 65536 ) works.But I don't know if there are more such numbers beyond that.Given that the problem asks for all ( a_0 > 1 ), and considering known primes and prime powers, perhaps the acceptable starting points are:- All primes ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a power of 2 (i.e., Mersenne primes), specifically ( p = 3, 7 ).- All powers of 2 where ( 2^n + 1 ) is a prime power, specifically ( 2, 4, 8, 16, 256, 65536 ), etc., but only up to known Fermat primes.But since the problem asks for all ( a_0 ), and considering that beyond certain points, the sequence may fail, perhaps the only acceptable starting points are ( a_0 = 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16 ).Wait, but let me check ( a_0 = 256 ) again. ( a_1 = 257 ), which is prime, ( a_2 = 259 ), which is composite. So, invalid.Similarly, ( a_0 = 65536 ): ( a_1 = 65537 ), prime, ( a_2 = 65539 ), prime, ( a_3 = 65543 ), prime, etc. So, that works.But 65536 is a power of 2, and ( 65536 + 1 = 65537 ) is a Fermat prime, and ( 65537 + 1 = 65538 ) is even, so ( a_2 = 65539 ), which is prime.So, perhaps ( a_0 = 65536 ) is acceptable.But I don't know if there are more such numbers beyond that.Given that, perhaps the acceptable starting points are:- All primes ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a power of 2: ( p = 3, 7 ).- All powers of 2 where ( 2^n + 1 ) is a Fermat prime: ( 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536 ).Additionally, ( a_0 = 8 ) works because ( 8 + 1 = 9 ), which is a prime power, and then the sequence continues with primes or prime powers.So, compiling all these, the acceptable ( a_0 ) are:- ( 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16, 256, 65536 ).But wait, ( a_0 = 8 ) is a power of 2, but ( 8 + 1 = 9 ), which is a prime power, so it's included in the powers of 2 where ( 2^n + 1 ) is a prime power.Similarly, ( a_0 = 3 ) is a prime where ( 3 + 1 = 4 ), a prime power.So, in conclusion, the acceptable starting points ( a_0 ) are:- All primes ( p ) where ( p + 1 ) is a power of 2: ( p = 3, 7 ).- All powers of 2 where ( 2^n + 1 ) is a prime power: ( 2, 4, 8, 16, 256, 65536 ).But wait, ( 2^n + 1 ) being a prime power includes both Fermat primes and cases where it's a higher power, like 9.So, in total, the acceptable ( a_0 ) are:- ( 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16, 256, 65536 ).But I need to confirm if ( a_0 = 256 ) is acceptable. As before, ( a_1 = 257 ), prime, ( a_2 = 259 ), composite. So, invalid.Wait, so perhaps ( a_0 = 256 ) is invalid.Similarly, ( a_0 = 65536 ): ( a_1 = 65537 ), prime, ( a_2 = 65539 ), prime, so that works.So, perhaps only ( a_0 = 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16, 65536 ).But I'm not sure if 65536 is the only higher power of 2 that works.Alternatively, perhaps the only acceptable starting points are ( a_0 = 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16 ).Because beyond that, the sequence fails.So, to sum up, after testing various starting points, the acceptable ( a_0 ) are:- ( a_0 = 2 ): works.- ( a_0 = 3 ): works.- ( a_0 = 4 ): works.- ( a_0 = 7 ): works.- ( a_0 = 8 ): works.- ( a_0 = 16 ): works.These are the starting points where the sequence continues with primes or prime powers indefinitely.Therefore, the answer is all ( a_0 ) equal to 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, or 16.**Final Answer**The acceptable starting values are ( boxed{2} ), ( boxed{3} ), ( boxed{4} ), ( boxed{7} ), ( boxed{8} ), and ( boxed{16} ).So, the final answer is ( boxed{2} ), ( boxed{3} ), ( boxed{4} ), ( boxed{7} ), ( boxed{8} ), and ( boxed{16} ).But since the problem asks to put the final answer within a single box, perhaps listing them all inside one box.**Final Answer**The values of ( a_0 ) are ( boxed{2} ), ( boxed{3} ), ( boxed{4} ), ( boxed{7} ), ( boxed{8} ), and ( boxed{16} ).But I think the standard way is to list them all in one box separated by commas.**Final Answer**The acceptable starting values are ( boxed{2} ), ( boxed{3} ), ( boxed{4} ), ( boxed{7} ), ( boxed{8} ), and ( boxed{16} ).But since the instructions say to put the final answer within boxed{}, perhaps I need to list them all inside a single box.But I think the standard is to have one box per answer, but since the answer is multiple numbers, perhaps list them all in one box.Alternatively, maybe the answer is all powers of 2 and 3, 7.But given the analysis, the acceptable ( a_0 ) are 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16.So, the final answer is:boxed{2}, boxed{3}, boxed{4}, boxed{7}, boxed{8}, boxed{16}But I think the system expects one box, so perhaps:The acceptable values of ( a_0 ) are ( boxed{2} ), ( boxed{3} ), ( boxed{4} ), ( boxed{7} ), ( boxed{8} ), and ( boxed{16} ).But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is all prime powers where the next number is also a prime power, leading to the conclusion that only 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 16 work.So, I'll go with that."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=x^{3}+ax^{2}+3x-9, find the value of a such that f(x) attains an extreme value at x=-3.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: given the function f(x) = x³ + a x² + 3x - 9, I need to find the value of 'a' such that f(x) has an extreme value at x = -3. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that extreme values of a function occur where the first derivative is zero or undefined. Since f(x) is a polynomial, its derivative will also be a polynomial, which is defined everywhere. So, I don't have to worry about the derivative being undefined; I just need to find where the derivative equals zero.So, let me start by finding the first derivative of f(x). The function is f(x) = x³ + a x² + 3x - 9. Taking the derivative term by term:- The derivative of x³ is 3x².- The derivative of a x² is 2a x.- The derivative of 3x is 3.- The derivative of -9 is 0.Putting it all together, f'(x) = 3x² + 2a x + 3.Now, since we know that f(x) has an extreme value at x = -3, that means f'(-3) should equal zero. So, I can plug x = -3 into the derivative and set it equal to zero to solve for 'a'.Let's do that:f'(-3) = 3(-3)² + 2a(-3) + 3 = 0.Calculating each term step by step:First, (-3) squared is 9, so 3 times 9 is 27.Next, 2a times (-3) is -6a.And then, we have +3.So, putting it all together: 27 - 6a + 3 = 0.Wait, let me make sure I did that right. 3*(-3)^2 is 3*9=27, 2a*(-3)= -6a, and then +3. So yes, 27 - 6a + 3.Combine the constants: 27 + 3 is 30. So, 30 - 6a = 0.Now, solving for 'a':30 - 6a = 0Subtract 30 from both sides: -6a = -30Divide both sides by -6: a = (-30)/(-6) = 5.So, a = 5.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting again:f'(x) = 3x² + 2a x + 3.At x = -3:f'(-3) = 3*(-3)^2 + 2a*(-3) + 3.Calculates to:3*9 + (-6a) + 3 = 27 - 6a + 3.27 + 3 is 30, so 30 - 6a = 0.Solving for a: 30 = 6a => a = 5.Yep, that seems correct.Just to be thorough, maybe I should plug 'a' back into the derivative and check if x = -3 is indeed a critical point.So, if a = 5, then f'(x) = 3x² + 10x + 3.Let's compute f'(-3):3*(-3)^2 + 10*(-3) + 3 = 3*9 + (-30) + 3 = 27 - 30 + 3 = 0.Perfect, that confirms it. So, x = -3 is a critical point when a = 5.But wait, just to make sure, is this an extreme value? Since the function is a cubic, it can have one or two critical points. The second derivative test can tell us if it's a maximum or minimum, but the question just asks for an extreme value, so it doesn't matter if it's a max or min, just that it's an extreme.But just for my own understanding, let's check the second derivative.f''(x) is the derivative of f'(x), so:f'(x) = 3x² + 2a x + 3, so f''(x) = 6x + 2a.At x = -3, f''(-3) = 6*(-3) + 2a = -18 + 2a.If a = 5, then f''(-3) = -18 + 10 = -8.Since f''(-3) is negative, that means the function is concave down at x = -3, so it's a local maximum. So, x = -3 is indeed an extreme value, specifically a local maximum.So, everything checks out. The value of 'a' is 5.I think that's solid. I started by finding the derivative, set it equal to zero at x = -3, solved for 'a', double-checked my calculations, and even did a second derivative test to confirm it's an extreme. So, yeah, a = 5 is the right answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = Asin(omega x + phi), where x in mathbb{R}, and (A > 0, omega > 0, 0 < phi < frac{pi}{2}), the period of the function is pi, and one of the lowest points on its graph is M(frac{2pi}{3}, -2).1. Find the analytical expression of f(x).2. When x in [0, frac{pi}{12}], find the maximum and minimum values of f(x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = A sin(ωx + φ), and I need to find its analytical expression given some conditions. Then, I also have to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) when x is between 0 and π/12. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the function is a sine function with amplitude A, angular frequency ω, and phase shift φ. The problem states that A > 0, ω > 0, and 0 < φ < π/2. So, all these constants are positive, and the phase shift is between 0 and π/2.The first piece of information given is that the period of the function is π. I remember that the period T of a sine function is related to ω by the formula T = 2π / ω. So, if the period is π, then:π = 2π / ωLet me solve for ω. Multiply both sides by ω:π * ω = 2πDivide both sides by π:ω = 2Okay, so ω is 2. That simplifies the function to f(x) = A sin(2x + φ). Good.Next, the problem says that one of the lowest points on the graph is M(2π/3, -2). So, this point is a minimum point of the function. Since it's a sine function, the minimum value occurs at the trough of the sine wave, which is -A. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the minimum point is -A. The given point has a y-coordinate of -2, so that tells me that A must be 2. Because -A = -2 implies A = 2.So now, the function is f(x) = 2 sin(2x + φ). Now, I need to find φ.To find φ, I can use the fact that the point M(2π/3, -2) lies on the graph of the function. So, plugging x = 2π/3 into the function should give me -2.Let me write that equation:2 sin(2*(2π/3) + φ) = -2Simplify inside the sine:2*(2π/3) = 4π/3So, the equation becomes:2 sin(4π/3 + φ) = -2Divide both sides by 2:sin(4π/3 + φ) = -1Now, when does sin(θ) = -1? That occurs at θ = 3π/2 + 2πk, where k is any integer. Since we're dealing with a phase shift, and φ is between 0 and π/2, we can find the appropriate θ.So, set 4π/3 + φ = 3π/2 + 2πkSolve for φ:φ = 3π/2 - 4π/3 + 2πkLet me compute 3π/2 - 4π/3. To subtract these, I need a common denominator, which is 6.3π/2 = 9π/64π/3 = 8π/6So, 9π/6 - 8π/6 = π/6Therefore, φ = π/6 + 2πkBut φ is given to be between 0 and π/2. So, let's see what k can be.If k = 0, φ = π/6, which is approximately 0.523 radians, which is less than π/2 (approximately 1.5708 radians). So, that's acceptable.If k = 1, φ = π/6 + 2π, which is way larger than π/2, so that's not acceptable.Similarly, k = -1 would give φ = π/6 - 2π, which is negative, which is also not acceptable since φ must be positive.Therefore, φ = π/6.So, putting it all together, the function is f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6).Wait, let me double-check that. If I plug x = 2π/3 into f(x), I should get -2.Compute 2x + π/6 when x = 2π/3:2*(2π/3) + π/6 = 4π/3 + π/6 = 8π/6 + π/6 = 9π/6 = 3π/2sin(3π/2) = -1, so 2*(-1) = -2. Perfect, that checks out.So, part 1 is done. The analytical expression is f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6).Now, moving on to part 2: When x ∈ [0, π/12], find the maximum and minimum values of f(x).So, I need to find the maximum and minimum of f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6) over the interval [0, π/12].To find extrema on a closed interval, I can use calculus. I can find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero, then evaluate the function at the critical points and endpoints.Alternatively, since it's a sine function, I can analyze its behavior over the interval.Let me first consider the derivative approach.Compute f'(x):f'(x) = d/dx [2 sin(2x + π/6)] = 2 * cos(2x + π/6) * 2 = 4 cos(2x + π/6)Set derivative equal to zero to find critical points:4 cos(2x + π/6) = 0Divide both sides by 4:cos(2x + π/6) = 0When does cosine equal zero? At π/2 + πk, where k is integer.So, 2x + π/6 = π/2 + πkSolve for x:2x = π/2 - π/6 + πkCompute π/2 - π/6:π/2 = 3π/6, so 3π/6 - π/6 = 2π/6 = π/3Therefore,2x = π/3 + πkx = π/6 + (π/2)kNow, we need to find all x in [0, π/12] such that x = π/6 + (π/2)k.Let me see for k = 0: x = π/6 ≈ 0.523, but π/12 ≈ 0.2618, so π/6 is larger than π/12. So, x = π/6 is outside the interval.For k = -1: x = π/6 - π/2 = -π/3, which is negative, so also outside the interval.For k = 1: x = π/6 + π/2 = 2π/3, which is way outside.So, there are no critical points in [0, π/12]. Therefore, the extrema must occur at the endpoints.Therefore, the maximum and minimum of f(x) on [0, π/12] occur at x = 0 or x = π/12.So, compute f(0) and f(π/12).Compute f(0):f(0) = 2 sin(2*0 + π/6) = 2 sin(π/6) = 2*(1/2) = 1Compute f(π/12):f(π/12) = 2 sin(2*(π/12) + π/6) = 2 sin(π/6 + π/6) = 2 sin(π/3) = 2*(√3/2) = √3 ≈ 1.732So, f(0) = 1, f(π/12) = √3.Since the function is continuous on [0, π/12] and has no critical points in between, the maximum is √3 and the minimum is 1.Wait, but hold on. Is the function increasing or decreasing on this interval? Let me check the derivative.The derivative f'(x) = 4 cos(2x + π/6). Let's evaluate the sign of the derivative on [0, π/12].At x = 0: f'(0) = 4 cos(π/6) = 4*(√3/2) = 2√3 > 0. So, the function is increasing at x = 0.At x = π/12: f'(π/12) = 4 cos(2*(π/12) + π/6) = 4 cos(π/6 + π/6) = 4 cos(π/3) = 4*(1/2) = 2 > 0. So, the derivative is still positive at x = π/12.Therefore, the function is increasing throughout the interval [0, π/12]. Therefore, the minimum is at x = 0, which is 1, and the maximum is at x = π/12, which is √3.So, that's the conclusion.Alternatively, without calculus, since it's a sine function with a certain phase shift, we can analyze the interval.The function f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6). Let me consider the argument of the sine function: 2x + π/6.When x ∈ [0, π/12], then 2x ∈ [0, π/6], so 2x + π/6 ∈ [π/6, π/6 + π/6] = [π/6, π/3].So, the argument of sine goes from π/6 to π/3.We know that sin(θ) is increasing on [0, π/2], so since π/6 to π/3 is within [0, π/2], sin(θ) is increasing on this interval.Therefore, sin(2x + π/6) is increasing as x increases from 0 to π/12. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on [0, π/12]. Therefore, the minimum is at x = 0, and the maximum at x = π/12.So, same result.Therefore, the maximum value is √3, and the minimum value is 1.So, summarizing:1. The function is f(x) = 2 sin(2x + π/6).2. On [0, π/12], the maximum is √3 and the minimum is 1.**Final Answer**1. The analytical expression of ( f(x) ) is (boxed{2 sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right)}).2. The maximum value is (boxed{sqrt{3}}) and the minimum value is (boxed{1})."},{"question":"Amy, Beth, and Jo listen to four different songs and discuss which ones they like. No song is liked by all three. Furthermore, for each of the three pairs of the girls, there is at least one song liked by those two girls but disliked by the third. In how many different ways is this possible?textbf{(A)} 108qquadtextbf{(B)} 132qquadtextbf{(C)} 671qquadtextbf{(D)} 846qquadtextbf{(E)} 1105","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here about Amy, Beth, and Jo listening to four different songs. They each have their own preferences, and there are some conditions given. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, the problem states that no song is liked by all three girls. That means for each song, at most two of them can like it. So, each song can be liked by none, one, two, or three, but since no song is liked by all three, it can't be liked by all three. So, the possible combinations for each song are: none like it, only Amy likes it, only Beth likes it, only Jo likes it, Amy and Beth like it, Amy and Jo like it, or Beth and Jo like it. That's seven possibilities for each song.Next, the problem says that for each of the three pairs of girls, there is at least one song liked by those two girls but disliked by the third. So, for the pair Amy and Beth, there must be at least one song that they both like but Jo doesn't. Similarly, for Amy and Jo, there must be at least one song they both like but Beth doesn't, and for Beth and Jo, there must be at least one song they both like but Amy doesn't.So, we're dealing with four songs, each with seven possibilities, but with the constraints that for each pair, there's at least one song liked by exactly that pair. So, the total number of possible ways without any constraints would be 7^4, which is 2401. But we have these constraints, so we need to subtract the cases where at least one of these pair conditions isn't met.This sounds like an inclusion-exclusion problem. Let me recall: inclusion-exclusion is used to calculate the probability or number of elements in the union of multiple sets by including and excluding the intersections appropriately. So, in this case, we can model the constraints as three conditions, each requiring that a certain pair has at least one song liked by them but not the third. So, we can define three sets A, B, and C where:- A: the set of configurations where there is no song liked by Amy and Beth but not Jo.- B: the set of configurations where there is no song liked by Amy and Jo but not Beth.- C: the set of configurations where there is no song liked by Beth and Jo but not Amy.We need to find the total number of configurations that are not in A, B, or C. So, using inclusion-exclusion, the number of valid configurations is:Total = 7^4 - |A ∪ B ∪ C|Which can be expanded as:Total = 7^4 - (|A| + |B| + |C|) + (|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|) - |A ∩ B ∩ C|So, I need to compute each of these terms.First, let's compute |A|. |A| is the number of configurations where there is no song liked by Amy and Beth but not Jo. That means, for each song, the possibility of Amy and Beth liking it without Jo is excluded. So, for each song, instead of 7 possibilities, we have 6 possibilities (since we remove the case where Amy and Beth like it and Jo doesn't). So, |A| = 6^4.Similarly, |B| and |C| are also 6^4 each.Next, |A ∩ B| is the number of configurations where neither Amy and Beth nor Amy and Jo have a song liked by exactly those two. So, for each song, we exclude two possibilities: Amy and Beth without Jo, and Amy and Jo without Beth. So, each song now has 5 possibilities. Thus, |A ∩ B| = 5^4. Similarly, |A ∩ C| and |B ∩ C| are also 5^4 each.Finally, |A ∩ B ∩ C| is the number of configurations where none of the three pairs have a song liked by exactly those two. So, for each song, we exclude all three possibilities: Amy and Beth without Jo, Amy and Jo without Beth, and Beth and Jo without Amy. So, each song now has 4 possibilities. Thus, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 4^4.So, plugging all these into the inclusion-exclusion formula:Total = 7^4 - 3*6^4 + 3*5^4 - 4^4Let me compute each term:7^4 = 7*7*7*7 = 49*49 = 24016^4 = 6*6*6*6 = 36*36 = 12965^4 = 5*5*5*5 = 25*25 = 6254^4 = 4*4*4*4 = 16*16 = 256So, plugging in:Total = 2401 - 3*1296 + 3*625 - 256Compute each multiplication:3*1296 = 38883*625 = 1875So,Total = 2401 - 3888 + 1875 - 256Now, compute step by step:2401 - 3888 = -1487-1487 + 1875 = 388388 - 256 = 132So, the total number of valid configurations is 132.Looking at the options, 132 is option B. So, the answer should be 132.Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.Compute 7^4: 7*7=49, 49*7=343, 343*7=2401.

Hmm, zeros of the function mean the points where ( f(x) = 0 ), right? So, I need to solve the equation ( -|x - 5| + 2^{x - 1} = 0 ), which simplifies to ( 2^{x - 1} = |x - 5| ). Alright, so I need to find all ( x ) such that ( 2^{x - 1} = |x - 5| ). Since the absolute value function ( |x - 5| ) can be split into two cases: when ( x geq 5 ) and when ( x < 5 ). Maybe I should consider these two cases separately.First, let me consider the case when ( x geq 5 ). In this case, ( |x - 5| = x - 5 ). So, the equation becomes ( 2^{x - 1} = x - 5 ). Hmm, that's an equation involving an exponential function and a linear function. These can sometimes be tricky because exponentials grow much faster than linear functions, but maybe I can find a solution by testing integer values or using some approximation.Let me try plugging in some integers greater than or equal to 5.When ( x = 5 ): ( 2^{5 - 1} = 2^4 = 16 ), and ( x - 5 = 0 ). So, 16 ≠ 0. Not a solution.When ( x = 6 ): ( 2^{6 - 1} = 32 ), and ( x - 5 = 1 ). 32 ≠ 1.When ( x = 7 ): ( 2^{7 - 1} = 64 ), and ( x - 5 = 2 ). 64 ≠ 2.Wait, it's clear that as ( x ) increases, ( 2^{x - 1} ) grows exponentially, while ( x - 5 ) grows linearly. So, for ( x geq 5 ), the left side is much larger than the right side. Maybe there's no solution in this interval? Or perhaps I need to check for some fractional ( x ) between 5 and 6?Wait, let me test ( x = 5.5 ). Then, ( 2^{5.5 - 1} = 2^{4.5} approx 22.627 ), and ( x - 5 = 0.5 ). So, 22.627 ≈ 0.5? No, that's not equal. So, even at 5.5, the left side is way larger. So, perhaps in the interval ( x geq 5 ), the equation ( 2^{x - 1} = x - 5 ) doesn't have a solution because the left side is always greater than the right side.Wait, but when ( x = 5 ), the left side is 16 and the right side is 0. So, maybe as ( x ) approaches 5 from the right, the left side is decreasing? Wait, no, ( 2^{x - 1} ) is an increasing function because the exponent is increasing. So, as ( x ) increases beyond 5, ( 2^{x - 1} ) increases, while ( x - 5 ) also increases, but much more slowly. So, actually, the left side is always above the right side for ( x geq 5 ). Therefore, there are no solutions in ( x geq 5 ).Okay, so maybe all the zeros are in the interval ( x < 5 ). Let's consider that case.When ( x < 5 ), ( |x - 5| = 5 - x ). So, the equation becomes ( 2^{x - 1} = 5 - x ). Now, this is another equation where an exponential function equals a linear function. Let's see if we can find solutions here.Again, let's try plugging in some integer values less than 5.When ( x = 4 ): ( 2^{4 - 1} = 8 ), and ( 5 - 4 = 1 ). 8 ≠ 1.When ( x = 3 ): ( 2^{3 - 1} = 4 ), and ( 5 - 3 = 2 ). 4 ≠ 2.When ( x = 2 ): ( 2^{2 - 1} = 2 ), and ( 5 - 2 = 3 ). 2 ≠ 3.When ( x = 1 ): ( 2^{1 - 1} = 1 ), and ( 5 - 1 = 4 ). 1 ≠ 4.When ( x = 0 ): ( 2^{0 - 1} = 0.5 ), and ( 5 - 0 = 5 ). 0.5 ≠ 5.Hmm, so none of these integer values satisfy the equation. Maybe I need to check between some of these integers.Let me try ( x = 3.5 ). Then, ( 2^{3.5 - 1} = 2^{2.5} approx 5.656 ), and ( 5 - 3.5 = 1.5 ). So, 5.656 ≈ 1.5? Not equal.Wait, so at ( x = 3 ), left side is 4, right side is 2. At ( x = 4 ), left side is 8, right side is 1. So, between 3 and 4, the left side goes from 4 to 8, while the right side goes from 2 to 1. So, the left side is increasing, the right side is decreasing. So, maybe they cross somewhere between 3 and 4?Wait, let's test ( x = 3.5 ) again: left ≈5.656, right=1.5. Left is larger.Wait, at ( x = 3 ): left=4, right=2. Left is larger.At ( x = 2.5 ): left= ( 2^{1.5} approx 2.828 ), right=5 - 2.5=2.5. So, left≈2.828, right=2.5. Left is still larger.Wait, so at ( x = 2 ): left=2, right=3. Left is smaller.Wait, so at ( x = 2 ): left=2, right=3. So, left < right.At ( x = 2.5 ): left≈2.828, right=2.5. Left > right.So, between ( x = 2 ) and ( x = 2.5 ), the left side goes from 2 to 2.828, while the right side goes from 3 to 2.5. So, they cross somewhere between 2 and 2.5.Similarly, between ( x = 2.5 ) and ( x = 3 ): left goes from 2.828 to 4, right goes from 2.5 to 2. So, left is increasing, right is decreasing, so they cross somewhere between 2.5 and 3.Wait, but actually, at ( x = 2 ): left=2 < right=3.At ( x = 2.5 ): left≈2.828 > right=2.5.So, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, since the function ( f(x) = 2^{x - 1} - (5 - x) ) is continuous, and it goes from negative to positive between 2 and 2.5, there must be a zero in that interval.Similarly, between 2.5 and 3, the function goes from positive to more positive? Wait, no. Wait, at ( x = 2.5 ), left≈2.828, right=2.5, so f(x)=2.828 - 2.5≈0.328>0.At ( x = 3 ): left=4, right=2, so f(x)=4 - 2=2>0.So, actually, from 2.5 to 3, f(x) remains positive. So, the only crossing is between 2 and 2.5.Wait, but hold on. Let me see.Wait, no, actually, f(x) = 2^{x - 1} - (5 - x). So, at x=2: f(2)=2 - 3= -1.At x=2.5: f(2.5)=2^{1.5} - 2.5≈2.828 - 2.5≈0.328.So, f(x) crosses from negative to positive between 2 and 2.5, so there is a zero in (2, 2.5).Similarly, let's check between x=3 and x=4.At x=3: f(3)=4 - 2=2.At x=4: f(4)=8 - 1=7.So, f(x) is increasing here, from 2 to 7. So, no crossing here.Wait, but wait, at x=5: f(5)=16 - 0=16. So, f(x) is positive all the way from x=3 onwards.Wait, but in the case when x <5, we have f(x)=2^{x -1} - (5 - x). So, let's see.Wait, is there another crossing?Wait, at x=0: f(0)=0.5 - 5= -4.5.At x=1: f(1)=1 - 4= -3.At x=2: f(2)=2 - 3= -1.At x=2.5: f(2.5)=2.828 - 2.5≈0.328.So, only one crossing between 2 and 2.5.Wait, but wait, let me check x=1.5.At x=1.5: f(1.5)=2^{0.5}≈1.414 - (5 -1.5)=1.414 - 3.5≈-2.086.So, still negative.At x=2: f(2)=2 - 3= -1.So, from x=1.5 to x=2, f(x) goes from -2.086 to -1. Still negative.At x=2.5: f(x)=0.328.So, only one crossing between 2 and 2.5.Wait, but hold on, let's think about the behavior as x approaches negative infinity.As x approaches negative infinity, 2^{x -1} approaches 0, and 5 - x approaches positive infinity. So, f(x) approaches -infinity.But as x increases from negative infinity, at some point, 2^{x -1} starts increasing, but 5 - x is decreasing.Wait, but in the negative x region, 2^{x -1} is always positive, but 5 - x is also positive, but decreasing as x increases.Wait, so when x is very negative, 2^{x -1} is near 0, so f(x)=0 - (5 - x)=x -5, which is negative when x <5, which is always true. So, as x increases from negative infinity, f(x) goes from negative infinity to... Hmm, wait, at x=5, f(x)=16 -0=16.Wait, but in the region x <5, f(x)=2^{x -1} - (5 - x). So, as x increases, 2^{x -1} increases, and 5 - x decreases. So, f(x) is increasing in x.Wait, is that true? Let me check the derivative.Wait, maybe I can compute the derivative to see if f(x) is increasing or decreasing.f(x)=2^{x -1} - (5 - x).So, f'(x)=ln(2)*2^{x -1} +1.Since ln(2) is positive, and 2^{x -1} is always positive, so f'(x) is always positive. So, f(x) is strictly increasing over all real numbers.Therefore, since f(x) is strictly increasing, it can have at most one zero. So, only one crossing.Earlier, we saw that f(2)= -1, f(2.5)=0.328, so the zero is between 2 and 2.5.Therefore, the zero is in the interval (2, 3). So, k=2.Wait, but hold on, let me confirm.Wait, is there another zero?Wait, if f(x) is strictly increasing, it can only cross zero once. So, only one zero.But let me check for x >5, just to be thorough.At x=5: f(5)=16 -0=16.At x=6: f(6)=32 -1=31.At x=7: f(7)=64 -2=62.So, f(x) is increasing for x >5 as well, because 2^{x -1} is increasing faster than x -5.So, f(x) is always increasing, so only one zero in (2, 2.5). So, the interval is (2,3), so k=2.Wait, but the question says \\"the zeros\\" plural, but since f(x) is strictly increasing, there's only one zero. So, the interval is (2,3), so k=2.Wait, but let me check for x=1. Let's see, f(1)=1 -4= -3.x=0: f(0)=0.5 -5= -4.5.x=-1: f(-1)=2^{-2}=0.25 - (5 - (-1))=0.25 -6= -5.75.So, f(x) is increasing, starting from negative infinity, crossing zero once between 2 and 3, and then going to positive infinity as x increases.So, only one zero, located in (2,3). Therefore, k=2.But wait, hold on, the original function is f(x)= -|x -5| +2^{x -1}. So, maybe I should plot or think about the behavior.Wait, when x approaches negative infinity, 2^{x -1} approaches 0, so f(x)= -|x -5| +0≈ -|x -5|, which approaches negative infinity.At x=5, f(x)= -0 +2^{4}=16.So, as x increases from negative infinity to 5, f(x) goes from negative infinity to 16, passing through zero once.Similarly, as x increases beyond 5, f(x)= - (x -5) +2^{x -1}, which is -x +5 +2^{x -1}. Since 2^{x -1} grows exponentially, f(x) will go to positive infinity as x increases beyond 5.But since f(x) is strictly increasing everywhere, it only crosses zero once.So, the zero is between 2 and 3, so k=2.Wait, but let me check with x=2. Let me compute f(2)= -|2 -5| +2^{2 -1}= -3 +2= -1.f(2.5)= -|2.5 -5| +2^{1.5}= -2.5 + approx 2.828≈0.328.So, f(2)= -1, f(2.5)=0.328. So, the zero is between 2 and 2.5, which is within (2,3). So, k=2.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check x=2.2.f(2.2)= -|2.2 -5| +2^{1.2}= -2.8 + approx 2.297≈-0.503.Still negative.x=2.3: f(2.3)= -2.7 +2^{1.3}≈-2.7 +2.462≈-0.238.Still negative.x=2.4: f(2.4)= -2.6 +2^{1.4}≈-2.6 +2.639≈0.039.So, f(2.4)≈0.039>0.So, the zero is between 2.3 and 2.4.So, approximately, the zero is around 2.35 or something.But regardless, it's between 2 and 3, so k=2.Wait, but the problem says \\"the zeros\\" plural, but since f(x) is strictly increasing, it can only have one zero. So, maybe the problem is worded incorrectly, or maybe I'm missing something.Wait, let me double-check.f(x)= -|x -5| +2^{x -1}.Is this function strictly increasing?Compute the derivative.For x <5: f(x)= - (5 -x) +2^{x -1}=x -5 +2^{x -1}.So, f'(x)=1 + ln(2)*2^{x -1}.Which is always positive because both terms are positive.For x >5: f(x)= - (x -5) +2^{x -1}= -x +5 +2^{x -1}.So, f'(x)= -1 + ln(2)*2^{x -1}.Now, when x >5, 2^{x -1} is greater than 16, so ln(2)*16≈11.09, so f'(x)= -1 +11.09≈10.09>0.So, for x >5, f'(x) is also positive.At x=5: f(x)= -0 +2^{4}=16.So, f(x) is differentiable everywhere except at x=5, but the left and right derivatives at x=5 are both positive.Therefore, f(x) is strictly increasing over all real numbers, so only one zero.Therefore, the zero is in (2,3), so the integer k is 2.Wait, but let me check x=1. Let me compute f(1)= -|1 -5| +2^{0}= -4 +1= -3.x=2: f(2)= -3 +2= -1.x=3: f(3)= -2 +4=2.So, f(3)=2>0.So, the function crosses zero between x=2 and x=3.Therefore, the interval is (2,3), so k=2.But wait, just to make sure, let me check x=2. Let me compute f(2)= -3 +2= -1.f(2.5)= -2.5 +2^{1.5}= -2.5 + approx 2.828≈0.328.So, yes, crosses between 2 and 2.5.Therefore, the integer k is 2.**Final Answer**The integer ( k ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"There is a sequence of numbers where the first number is 105 and the second number is 85. Starting from the third number, each number is the average of the two preceding numbers. What is the integer part of the 2011th number?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a sequence of numbers. The first number is 105, the second is 85, and from the third number onward, each number is the average of the two before it. I need to find the integer part of the 2011th number. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down what the sequence looks like. The first term, let's call it a₁, is 105. The second term, a₂, is 85. Then, starting from a₃, each term is the average of the two previous terms. So, a₃ = (a₁ + a₂)/2. Let me calculate that: (105 + 85)/2 = 190/2 = 95. So, a₃ is 95.Now, a₄ would be the average of a₂ and a₃. That would be (85 + 95)/2 = 180/2 = 90. So, a₄ is 90. Then, a₅ is the average of a₃ and a₄, which is (95 + 90)/2 = 185/2 = 92.5. Hmm, okay, so a₅ is 92.5.Continuing this way, a₆ would be the average of a₄ and a₅: (90 + 92.5)/2 = 182.5/2 = 91.25. So, a₆ is 91.25. Then, a₇ is the average of a₅ and a₆: (92.5 + 91.25)/2 = 183.75/2 = 91.875. Hmm, interesting, the numbers are getting closer to something.Wait a minute, maybe this sequence is converging to a particular value? Let me check a few more terms. a₈ would be the average of a₆ and a₇: (91.25 + 91.875)/2 = 183.125/2 = 91.5625. Then, a₉ is the average of a₇ and a₈: (91.875 + 91.5625)/2 = 183.4375/2 = 91.71875. Hmm, so it's oscillating around a value, getting closer each time.I think this sequence is approaching a limit. Let me denote the limit as L. If the sequence converges, then as n approaches infinity, aₙ and aₙ₋₁ both approach L. So, according to the recurrence relation, each term is the average of the two before it. So, in the limit, L = (L + L)/2, which simplifies to L = L. Hmm, that doesn't help much.Wait, maybe I need to set up the equation differently. Since each term is the average of the two previous terms, the recurrence relation is aₙ = (aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₂)/2. If the sequence converges to L, then both aₙ₋₁ and aₙ₋₂ approach L, so plugging into the recurrence relation gives L = (L + L)/2, which is L = L. Hmm, that's just an identity, so it doesn't tell me the value of L.Maybe I need another approach. Let me consider the difference between consecutive terms. Let's define dₙ = aₙ - aₙ₋₁. Then, let's see how dₙ relates to dₙ₋₁.From the recurrence relation, aₙ = (aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₂)/2. So, aₙ - aₙ₋₁ = (aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₂)/2 - aₙ₋₁ = (-aₙ₋₁ + aₙ₋₂)/2 = -(aₙ₋₁ - aₙ₋₂)/2 = -dₙ₋₁/2.So, dₙ = -dₙ₋₁/2. That's a nice relation. So, each difference is half the negative of the previous difference. That means the differences form a geometric sequence with common ratio -1/2.Let me write that down: dₙ = (-1/2) * dₙ₋₁. So, starting from d₂ = a₂ - a₁ = 85 - 105 = -20. Then, d₃ = (-1/2)*d₂ = (-1/2)*(-20) = 10. d₄ = (-1/2)*d₃ = (-1/2)*10 = -5. d₅ = (-1/2)*d₄ = (-1/2)*(-5) = 2.5. d₆ = (-1/2)*d₅ = (-1/2)*2.5 = -1.25. d₇ = (-1/2)*d₆ = (-1/2)*(-1.25) = 0.625. And so on.So, the differences alternate in sign and decrease in magnitude by a factor of 1/2 each time. That makes sense with the sequence oscillating around a limit, getting closer each time.Now, since the differences form a geometric sequence, maybe I can express aₙ in terms of a₁ and the sum of the differences up to n-1.In general, aₙ = a₁ + Σ (from k=2 to n) dₖ.So, let's write that out:aₙ = a₁ + d₂ + d₃ + d₄ + ... + dₙ.But since dₖ = (-1/2)^{k-2} * d₂, because each term is multiplied by -1/2 each time.Wait, let's see:d₂ = -20d₃ = (-1/2)*d₂ = (-1/2)*(-20) = 10 = (-1/2)^{1} * (-20)d₄ = (-1/2)*d₃ = (-1/2)*10 = -5 = (-1/2)^2 * (-20)d₅ = (-1/2)*d₄ = (-1/2)*(-5) = 2.5 = (-1/2)^3 * (-20)So, in general, dₖ = (-1/2)^{k-2} * (-20). So, for k ≥ 2, dₖ = (-1/2)^{k-2} * (-20).Therefore, the sum from k=2 to n of dₖ is the sum from m=0 to n-2 of (-1/2)^m * (-20). Wait, let me make a substitution: let m = k - 2, so when k=2, m=0; when k=n, m=n-2.So, the sum becomes Σ (from m=0 to n-2) [ (-1/2)^m * (-20) ].Factor out the -20: -20 * Σ (from m=0 to n-2) [ (-1/2)^m ].That's a geometric series with first term 1, ratio -1/2, and n-1 terms.The sum of a geometric series is S = (1 - r^{number of terms}) / (1 - r).So, here, S = [1 - (-1/2)^{n-1}] / [1 - (-1/2)] = [1 - (-1/2)^{n-1}] / (3/2) = (2/3)[1 - (-1/2)^{n-1}].Therefore, the sum from k=2 to n of dₖ is -20 * (2/3)[1 - (-1/2)^{n-1}] = (-40/3)[1 - (-1/2)^{n-1}].So, putting it all together, aₙ = a₁ + sum of dₖ from k=2 to n = 105 + (-40/3)[1 - (-1/2)^{n-1}].Simplify that:aₙ = 105 - (40/3)[1 - (-1/2)^{n-1}].Let me write that as:aₙ = 105 - 40/3 + (40/3)(-1/2)^{n-1}.Simplify 105 - 40/3: 105 is 315/3, so 315/3 - 40/3 = 275/3.So, aₙ = 275/3 + (40/3)(-1/2)^{n-1}.Therefore, the general formula for aₙ is:aₙ = (275/3) + (40/3)(-1/2)^{n-1}.Okay, that seems manageable. So, for any n, we can compute aₙ using this formula.Now, the problem asks for the integer part of the 2011th number, which is a_{2011}.So, let's compute a_{2011}.First, plug n=2011 into the formula:a_{2011} = 275/3 + (40/3)(-1/2)^{2010}.Wait, because (-1/2)^{n-1} when n=2011 is (-1/2)^{2010}.So, let's compute each part.First, 275/3 is approximately 91.666666...Then, the second term is (40/3)(-1/2)^{2010}.Note that (-1/2)^{2010} is equal to (1/2)^{2010} because the exponent is even, so the negative sign goes away.So, (40/3)(1/2)^{2010}.Now, (1/2)^{2010} is an extremely small number. It's 1 divided by 2^{2010}, which is a gigantic number. So, (40/3) times that is still a very, very small number, almost zero.Therefore, a_{2011} is approximately 275/3 + something negligible.But let's see if we can get a better estimate.First, 275 divided by 3 is 91 and 2/3, which is approximately 91.666666...Then, (40/3)(1/2)^{2010} is positive because both 40/3 and (1/2)^{2010} are positive.So, a_{2011} is slightly larger than 275/3.But since (1/2)^{2010} is so small, the addition is negligible for all practical purposes, especially when considering the integer part.Therefore, the integer part of a_{2011} is the integer part of 275/3, which is 91.But wait, let me make sure. 275 divided by 3 is 91.666..., so the integer part is 91. But since a_{2011} is slightly larger than 91.666..., does that mean the integer part is still 91 or does it round up to 92?Wait, the integer part is the greatest integer less than or equal to the number. So, even if a_{2011} is 91.666... plus a tiny bit, it's still less than 92. So, the integer part is 91.But let me double-check my reasoning.Given that aₙ = 275/3 + (40/3)(-1/2)^{n-1}, and for n=2011, that term is positive because (-1/2)^{2010} is positive.So, a_{2011} = 275/3 + (40/3)(1/2)^{2010}.So, 275/3 is approximately 91.666666...Adding a positive number, no matter how small, will make a_{2011} slightly larger than 91.666666...But 91.666666... is 91 and 2/3, so adding a positive number will make it 91.666666... + ε, where ε is a very small positive number. However, since ε is less than 1, the integer part remains 91.Wait, but hold on, is ε less than 1? Let's see.(40/3)(1/2)^{2010} is equal to (40/3) * (1/2)^{2010}.Compute (1/2)^{2010}: that's 1 divided by 2^{2010}. 2^{10} is about 1000, 2^{20} is a million, so 2^{2010} is 2^{10*201} = (2^{10})^{201} ≈ (1000)^{201}, which is 1 followed by 603 zeros. So, 1 divided by that is 10^{-603} approximately.So, (40/3) * 10^{-603} is roughly 1.333... * 10^{-602}, which is 0.000...1333... with 602 zeros after the decimal point.So, adding that to 275/3, which is 91.666666..., the result is 91.666666... + 0.000...1333..., which is still less than 91.666666... + 0.000...2, which is still less than 92.Therefore, the integer part is 91.Wait, but hold on, 275/3 is exactly 91 and 2/3. So, 91.666666...If we add something positive to it, even if it's extremely small, it's still more than 91.666666...But the integer part is the floor function, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to the number.So, since 91.666666... + ε is still less than 92, the floor is 91.Therefore, the integer part is 91.But just to make sure, let me think about the behavior of the sequence.Earlier, we saw that the sequence alternates around the limit, getting closer each time.So, starting from 105, 85, 95, 90, 92.5, 91.25, 91.875, 91.5625, 91.71875, 91.640625, and so on.So, it's oscillating around 91.666..., getting closer each time.So, as n increases, the terms approach 275/3, which is approximately 91.666...Therefore, for very large n, like 2011, the term is extremely close to 275/3, just slightly above or below depending on whether n is odd or even.But in our case, since n=2011 is odd, let's see.Wait, in the formula, aₙ = 275/3 + (40/3)(-1/2)^{n-1}.So, when n is odd, n-1 is even, so (-1/2)^{n-1} is positive. Therefore, aₙ is 275/3 plus a positive term, so it's slightly larger than 275/3.But 275/3 is approximately 91.666666...So, a_{2011} is slightly larger than 91.666666..., but still less than 92. So, the integer part is 91.Therefore, the integer part of the 2011th number is 91.**Final Answer**The integer part of the 2011th number is boxed{91}."},{"question":"Given that the radius of a regular hexagon is 3 cm, what is the length of the perimeter of this regular hexagon?","answer":"To find the perimeter of a regular hexagon with a radius of 3 cm, I start by recalling that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with a side length equal to the radius of the hexagon.Since the radius is 3 cm, each side of the hexagon is also 3 cm.

However, one night an evil hacker cut several cables, resulting in 8 clusters. Find the maximum possible number of cables that were cut.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a computer center with 200 computers connected by 345 cables. Initially, all computers were in one big cluster, meaning they were all connected somehow. But then a hacker cut some cables, and now there are 8 clusters instead. I need to find the maximum number of cables that could have been cut. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.First, I remember that in graph theory, a cluster is like a connected component. So, the entire network is a graph with 200 nodes and 345 edges. Initially, it was one connected component, but after cutting some edges, it became 8 connected components. I need to figure out how many edges were cut to achieve this, and specifically, the maximum number of edges that could have been cut.I recall that the number of edges in a connected graph with n nodes is at least n-1. This is because a tree has exactly n-1 edges and is connected. So, if we have 8 clusters, each cluster must be a connected component. To maximize the number of edges cut, we need to minimize the number of edges remaining in each cluster because the fewer edges we have in total, the more edges were cut.So, if each cluster is a tree, which has the minimum number of edges, then each cluster with k nodes will have k-1 edges. Therefore, the total number of edges remaining after the cut would be the sum of (k_i - 1) for each cluster i, where k_i is the number of nodes in cluster i.Let me denote the number of nodes in each cluster as k1, k2, ..., k8. So, the total number of nodes is k1 + k2 + ... + k8 = 200. The total number of edges remaining is (k1 - 1) + (k2 - 1) + ... + (k8 - 1) = (k1 + k2 + ... + k8) - 8 = 200 - 8 = 192.Wait, so if all clusters are trees, the total number of edges remaining is 192. Originally, there were 345 edges. So, the number of edges cut would be 345 - 192 = 153. Hmm, so is 153 the maximum number of cables that could have been cut?But hold on, is it possible for all clusters to be trees? Because if the original graph was connected, it's possible that by cutting edges, we can split it into multiple trees. But I need to make sure that the clusters are indeed connected components, each being a tree.But wait, another thought: the original graph might have cycles, right? So, if we have cycles, cutting edges that are part of cycles won't disconnect the graph. So, to maximize the number of edges cut, we need to cut as many edges as possible without disconnecting the graph until we reach 8 clusters. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of spanning trees.Wait, the original graph has 200 nodes and 345 edges. A spanning tree for 200 nodes would have 199 edges. So, the original graph has 345 - 199 = 146 extra edges beyond a spanning tree. These extra edges are the ones that create cycles.If we want to split the graph into 8 clusters, each of which is a spanning tree, then each cluster would have (k_i - 1) edges. So, the total edges after cutting would be 192, as I calculated before. Therefore, the number of edges cut is 345 - 192 = 153.But wait, is it possible to have all clusters as trees? Because if the original graph had cycles, cutting edges in cycles can disconnect the graph. So, maybe the maximum number of edges that can be cut is 153.Alternatively, maybe I can think about it as the number of edges in a forest with 8 trees. A forest with n nodes and c components has n - c edges. So, in this case, 200 - 8 = 192 edges. So, the maximum number of edges that can be cut is 345 - 192 = 153.Yes, that seems consistent. So, the maximum number of cables that could have been cut is 153.Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose the original graph is connected with 200 nodes and 345 edges. To split it into 8 connected components, we need to remove enough edges so that the graph is no longer connected, but each component is still connected.Each time we cut an edge that is a bridge, it can increase the number of connected components by 1. But to get from 1 component to 8, we need to cut at least 7 bridges. But that would only give us 8 components, but we might have more edges to cut.Wait, no, actually, if we have cycles, we can cut edges in cycles without disconnecting the graph. So, to maximize the number of edges cut, we should cut as many edges as possible, both bridges and non-bridges, but ensuring that each component remains connected.But actually, to maximize the number of edges cut, we need to minimize the number of edges remaining. The minimal number of edges in a graph with 8 connected components is 200 - 8 = 192, as each connected component is a tree. So, the maximum number of edges that can be cut is 345 - 192 = 153.Therefore, 153 is the maximum number of cables that could have been cut.Wait, but hold on, is 192 the minimal number of edges for 8 connected components? Yes, because each connected component must have at least (k_i - 1) edges, so the total is 200 - 8 = 192.Therefore, the maximum number of edges that can be cut is 345 - 192 = 153.So, I think 153 is the answer.**Final Answer**The maximum possible number of cables that were cut is boxed{153}."},{"question":"If a and b are opposite numbers, and c is the cube root of 8, then 2a+2b-c=______.","answer":"First, I recognize that ( a ) and ( b ) are opposite numbers, which means ( b = -a ).Next, ( c ) is the cube root of 8.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let me recall what an arithmetic progression (AP) is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. Since it's decreasing, the common difference will be negative. So, if I denote the first term as 'a' and the common difference as '-d' (where d is positive), the five terms can be written as:a, a - d, a - 2d, a - 3d, a - 4d.So, the five numbers are: a, a - d, a - 2d, a - 3d, a - 4d.Now, the problem states two conditions:1. The sum of their cubes is zero.2. The sum of their fourth powers is 136.I need to find the smallest number, which would be the fifth term: a - 4d.Let me write down these two conditions mathematically.First condition: Sum of cubes is zero.So,a³ + (a - d)³ + (a - 2d)³ + (a - 3d)³ + (a - 4d)³ = 0.Second condition: Sum of fourth powers is 136.So,a⁴ + (a - d)⁴ + (a - 2d)⁴ + (a - 3d)⁴ + (a - 4d)⁴ = 136.Hmm, okay. So I have two equations with two variables, 'a' and 'd'. I need to solve these equations to find 'a' and 'd', and then compute a - 4d to get the smallest number.Let me first tackle the first equation: the sum of cubes equals zero.I think it might be helpful to expand each cube term and then combine like terms. Let's see.First, let's recall the formula for (x - y)³:(x - y)³ = x³ - 3x²y + 3xy² - y³.So, applying this to each term:1. a³ is just a³.2. (a - d)³ = a³ - 3a²d + 3ad² - d³.3. (a - 2d)³ = a³ - 6a²d + 12ad² - 8d³.Wait, hold on, let me verify that. Let me compute (a - 2d)³:= (a)³ + (-2d)³ + 3*(a)²*(-2d) + 3*a*(-2d)²= a³ - 8d³ - 6a²d + 12ad².Yes, that's correct.Similarly, (a - 3d)³:= a³ - 27d³ - 9a²d + 27ad².And (a - 4d)³:= a³ - 64d³ - 12a²d + 48ad².Okay, so now let's write all these expanded forms:1. a³2. a³ - 3a²d + 3ad² - d³3. a³ - 6a²d + 12ad² - 8d³4. a³ - 9a²d + 27ad² - 27d³5. a³ - 12a²d + 48ad² - 64d³Now, let's sum all these up. Let's collect like terms.First, the a³ terms:1. a³2. a³3. a³4. a³5. a³Total a³ terms: 5a³.Next, the a²d terms:1. 02. -3a²d3. -6a²d4. -9a²d5. -12a²dTotal a²d terms: (-3 -6 -9 -12)a²d = (-30a²d).Next, the ad² terms:1. 02. 3ad²3. 12ad²4. 27ad²5. 48ad²Total ad² terms: (3 + 12 + 27 + 48)ad² = 90ad².Next, the d³ terms:1. 02. -d³3. -8d³4. -27d³5. -64d³Total d³ terms: (-1 -8 -27 -64)d³ = (-100d³).So, putting it all together, the sum of cubes is:5a³ - 30a²d + 90ad² - 100d³ = 0.So, equation (1):5a³ - 30a²d + 90ad² - 100d³ = 0.Let me factor out a common factor of 5:5(a³ - 6a²d + 18ad² - 20d³) = 0.Divide both sides by 5:a³ - 6a²d + 18ad² - 20d³ = 0.Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can factor this expression.Looking at a³ - 6a²d + 18ad² - 20d³.Perhaps factor by grouping.Group first two terms and last two terms:(a³ - 6a²d) + (18ad² - 20d³)Factor a² from first group: a²(a - 6d)Factor 2d² from second group: 2d²(9a - 10d)Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.Alternatively, perhaps factor as (a - kd)(something). Let me try to factor.Let me assume that (a - 2d) is a factor. Let's test a = 2d.Plug a = 2d into the polynomial:(2d)³ - 6*(2d)²*d + 18*(2d)*d² - 20d³= 8d³ - 6*4d³ + 36d³ - 20d³= 8d³ -24d³ +36d³ -20d³= (8 -24 +36 -20)d³ = 0.Yes, it equals zero. So, (a - 2d) is a factor.Therefore, we can factor the polynomial as (a - 2d)(something).Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.Divide a³ - 6a²d + 18ad² - 20d³ by (a - 2d).Using synthetic division:Let me write coefficients in terms of a:Coefficients: 1 (a³), -6d (a²), 18d² (a), -20d³ (constant).Divide by (a - 2d), so we use 2d as the root.Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 2d: 2d.Add to next coefficient: -6d + 2d = -4d.Multiply -4d by 2d: -8d².Add to next coefficient: 18d² + (-8d²) = 10d².Multiply 10d² by 2d: 20d³.Add to last coefficient: -20d³ + 20d³ = 0.So, the result is a² -4d a +10d².Therefore, the polynomial factors as:(a - 2d)(a² - 4ad + 10d²) = 0.So, either a - 2d = 0, which implies a = 2d, or a² -4ad +10d² = 0.Let me check the discriminant of the quadratic equation a² -4ad +10d² = 0.Discriminant D = ( -4d )² - 4*1*10d² = 16d² -40d² = -24d² < 0.So, no real solutions from the quadratic. Therefore, the only real solution is a = 2d.So, from the first equation, we have a = 2d.Alright, so that's a useful relation. Now, let's move on to the second condition: the sum of the fourth powers is 136.So, let's write the sum:a⁴ + (a - d)⁴ + (a - 2d)⁴ + (a - 3d)⁴ + (a - 4d)⁴ = 136.Again, since we know a = 2d, we can substitute a with 2d in this equation.So, replacing a with 2d:(2d)⁴ + (2d - d)⁴ + (2d - 2d)⁴ + (2d - 3d)⁴ + (2d - 4d)⁴ = 136.Simplify each term:1. (2d)⁴ = 16d⁴.2. (2d - d)⁴ = (d)⁴ = d⁴.3. (2d - 2d)⁴ = (0)⁴ = 0.4. (2d - 3d)⁴ = (-d)⁴ = d⁴.5. (2d - 4d)⁴ = (-2d)⁴ = 16d⁴.So, substituting back:16d⁴ + d⁴ + 0 + d⁴ + 16d⁴ = 136.Combine like terms:16d⁴ + d⁴ + d⁴ + 16d⁴ = (16 + 1 + 1 + 16)d⁴ = 34d⁴.So, 34d⁴ = 136.Divide both sides by 34:d⁴ = 4.So, d⁴ = 4. Therefore, d² = sqrt(4) = 2 or d² = -sqrt(4) = -2. But since d² is always non-negative, we have d² = 2.Thus, d = sqrt(2) or d = -sqrt(2). But since d is the common difference in a decreasing AP, and we defined d as positive (since the common difference is negative), so d = sqrt(2).Wait, hold on. Wait, in the beginning, I set the common difference as '-d', where d is positive, so that the sequence is decreasing. So, the actual common difference is negative, which is why the terms decrease.But in our substitution, we had a = 2d, so if d is positive, a is positive as well.So, d = sqrt(2). Therefore, a = 2d = 2*sqrt(2).So, now, the five terms are:a = 2√2,a - d = 2√2 - √2 = √2,a - 2d = 2√2 - 2√2 = 0,a - 3d = 2√2 - 3√2 = -√2,a - 4d = 2√2 - 4√2 = -2√2.So, the five numbers are: 2√2, √2, 0, -√2, -2√2.Let me verify the two conditions.First, sum of cubes:(2√2)³ + (√2)³ + 0³ + (-√2)³ + (-2√2)³.Compute each term:(2√2)³ = 8*(√2)³ = 8*(2√2) = 16√2.(√2)³ = (√2)*(√2)² = √2*2 = 2√2.0³ = 0.(-√2)³ = - (√2)³ = -2√2.(-2√2)³ = -8*(√2)³ = -16√2.So, summing them up:16√2 + 2√2 + 0 - 2√2 -16√2.Combine like terms:(16√2 -16√2) + (2√2 - 2√2) + 0 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.Good, that satisfies the first condition.Now, sum of fourth powers:(2√2)^4 + (√2)^4 + 0^4 + (-√2)^4 + (-2√2)^4.Compute each term:(2√2)^4 = (2)^4*(√2)^4 = 16*(4) = 64.(√2)^4 = (√2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4.0^4 = 0.(-√2)^4 = (√2)^4 = 4.(-2√2)^4 = (2√2)^4 = 64.So, summing them up:64 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 64 = 64 + 4 + 4 + 64 = 136.Perfect, that satisfies the second condition.So, all conditions are satisfied with a = 2√2 and d = √2.Therefore, the five numbers are: 2√2, √2, 0, -√2, -2√2.So, the smallest number is -2√2.Wait, but let me just double-check if I interpreted the progression correctly. The problem says it's a decreasing arithmetic progression, so starting from the largest term and decreasing. So, the first term is the largest, and the fifth term is the smallest. So, yes, the smallest is -2√2.But just to make sure, let me write out the terms:First term: a = 2√2 ≈ 2.828,Second term: a - d = √2 ≈ 1.414,Third term: 0,Fourth term: -√2 ≈ -1.414,Fifth term: -2√2 ≈ -2.828.Yes, that's a decreasing sequence, each term is smaller than the previous one. So, the smallest is indeed -2√2.Therefore, the answer is -2√2.But wait, just to make sure, let me check if I substituted correctly in the fourth powers.Wait, (2√2)^4: 2^4 is 16, (√2)^4 is 4, so 16*4=64. Correct.Similarly, (√2)^4 is 4, and (-√2)^4 is also 4. Correct.So, 64 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 64 = 136. Correct.And the cubes: 16√2 + 2√2 - 2√2 -16√2 = 0. Correct.So, everything checks out.Therefore, the smallest number is -2√2.**Final Answer**The smallest of these numbers is boxed{-2sqrt{2}}."},{"question":"The variance of a set of data is 5. If each data point in this set is multiplied by 2 and then increased by 3, the variance of the resulting set of data is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: The variance of a set of data is 5. If each data point in this set is multiplied by 2 and then increased by 3, the variance of the resulting set of data is ______. Hmm, I need to figure out what the new variance is after these transformations. Let me think about how variance works when you transform the data.First, I remember that variance measures how spread out the data points are from the mean. So, if we do something to each data point, it might affect how spread out they are. Specifically, if we multiply each data point by a constant or add a constant, that should affect the variance in some way.Let me recall the properties of variance. I think if you add a constant to each data point, the variance doesn't change. Because adding a constant just shifts all the data points by the same amount, so the spread remains the same. On the other hand, if you multiply each data point by a constant, the variance gets multiplied by the square of that constant. That makes sense because multiplying by a constant scales the spread of the data.So, in this problem, each data point is first multiplied by 2 and then increased by 3. Let me break this down step by step.First, multiplying each data point by 2. Since variance is affected by scaling, this should change the variance. Specifically, the new variance should be (2)^2 times the original variance. Let me write that down: new variance after scaling = (2)^2 * original variance.The original variance is 5, so that would be 4 * 5 = 20. Okay, so after multiplying each data point by 2, the variance becomes 20.Next, we increase each data point by 3. As I thought earlier, adding a constant doesn't affect the variance. So, adding 3 to each data point won't change the spread, just shifts everything up by 3. Therefore, the variance remains 20 after this transformation.Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the order or the operations. The transformations are: multiply by 2 first, then add 3. Since variance is affected by scaling but not by shifting, the order of operations doesn't matter in terms of the effect on variance. Whether you scale first or shift first, the scaling affects variance, and shifting doesn't. So, even if I had added 3 first and then multiplied by 2, the variance would still be scaled by 4. But in this case, it's multiplied by 2 first, so the scaling is applied before the shifting, but the shifting doesn't affect variance either way.Just to be thorough, let me consider the mathematical definition of variance. The variance of a set of data is the average of the squared differences from the mean. So, if we have a data set X with mean μ, the variance σ² is given by:σ² = (1/n) * Σ(xi - μ)²Now, if we transform each data point xi to yi = a*xi + b, where a and b are constants, then the new mean μ' becomes a*μ + b. The new variance σ'² would be:σ'² = (1/n) * Σ(yi - μ')²= (1/n) * Σ(a*xi + b - (a*μ + b))²= (1/n) * Σ(a*(xi - μ))²= (1/n) * Σ(a²*(xi - μ)²)= a² * (1/n) * Σ(xi - μ)²= a² * σ²So, the variance scales by a², and the addition of b doesn't affect it. That confirms my earlier thought. So, in this problem, a is 2 and b is 3. Therefore, the new variance is (2)² * 5 = 4 * 5 = 20.Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think of an example. Suppose I have a simple data set where the variance is 5. Let's say the data set is [1, 3]. The mean is (1 + 3)/2 = 2. The squared differences are (1-2)² = 1 and (3-2)² = 1. So, variance is (1 + 1)/2 = 1. Wait, that's variance 1, not 5. Hmm, maybe I need a different example.Let me pick another data set. Suppose the data set is [0, 4]. The mean is (0 + 4)/2 = 2. The squared differences are (0-2)² = 4 and (4-2)² = 4. So, variance is (4 + 4)/2 = 4. Still not 5. Maybe [ -1, 3, 5]. Let's see: mean is (-1 + 3 + 5)/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333. Squared differences: (-1 - 7/3)² = (-10/3)² = 100/9 ≈ 11.11, (3 - 7/3)² = (2/3)² ≈ 0.444, (5 - 7/3)² = (8/3)² ≈ 7.111. Adding these up: 11.11 + 0.444 + 7.111 ≈ 18.665. Divide by 3: ≈ 6.222. Hmm, still not 5. Maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, maybe I can use a known formula or think about standard deviation. Since variance is the square of standard deviation, if I know how standard deviation changes, I can find the variance. But in this case, since variance is directly affected by the scaling factor squared, it's straightforward.Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of linear transformations. If you have a random variable X with variance Var(X), then Var(aX + b) = a² Var(X). So, in this case, a is 2 and b is 3, so Var(2X + 3) = 4 Var(X) = 4*5 = 20. That seems consistent.So, yeah, I think 20 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the example I tried earlier, although not matching the variance of 5, still supports the idea that scaling affects variance quadratically and shifting doesn't. So, I feel confident that the variance after multiplying each data point by 2 and then adding 3 is 20.**Final Answer**The variance of the resulting set of data is boxed{20}."},{"question":"If C_n^3 = C_{n-1}^3 + C_{n-1}^4, then the value of n is.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If ( C_n^3 = C_{n-1}^3 + C_{n-1}^4 ), then I need to find the value of ( n ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that ( C_n^k ) is the combination formula, which is equal to ( frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} ). So, maybe I can express both sides of the equation using factorials and then solve for ( n ). Let me write down the equation again:( C_n^3 = C_{n-1}^3 + C_{n-1}^4 )Translating each term into factorials:Left side: ( C_n^3 = frac{n!}{3!(n - 3)!} )Right side: ( C_{n-1}^3 + C_{n-1}^4 = frac{(n - 1)!}{3!(n - 4)!} + frac{(n - 1)!}{4!(n - 5)!} )Hmm, okay. So, now I have:( frac{n!}{6(n - 3)!} = frac{(n - 1)!}{6(n - 4)!} + frac{(n - 1)!}{24(n - 5)!} )Wait, let me make sure I simplified the factorials correctly. For ( C_n^3 ), it's ( frac{n!}{3! (n - 3)!} = frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)}{6} ). Yeah, that's correct.Similarly, ( C_{n-1}^3 = frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)}{6} ) and ( C_{n-1}^4 = frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)}{24} ). So, substituting these back into the equation:( frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)}{6} = frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)}{6} + frac{(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)}{24} )Hmm, okay. Let me factor out common terms on the right side. I notice that both terms on the right have ( (n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) ) as a factor. Let me factor that out:( frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)}{6} = (n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) left( frac{1}{6} + frac{(n - 4)}{24} right) )Let me compute the expression inside the parentheses:( frac{1}{6} + frac{n - 4}{24} = frac{4}{24} + frac{n - 4}{24} = frac{4 + n - 4}{24} = frac{n}{24} )So, now the right side becomes:( (n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) times frac{n}{24} )So, putting it back into the equation:( frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)}{6} = frac{n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)}{24} )Hmm, okay. Now, I can see that both sides have ( n(n - 1)(n - 2) ). Let me divide both sides by ( n(n - 1)(n - 2) ) assuming that ( n neq 0, 1, 2 ) because otherwise, the combinations wouldn't make sense (since you can't choose more elements than you have). So, dividing both sides:( frac{1}{6} = frac{(n - 3)}{24} )Now, solving for ( n ):Multiply both sides by 24:( frac{24}{6} = n - 3 )Simplify:( 4 = n - 3 )Add 3 to both sides:( n = 7 )Wait, let me double-check that. If ( n = 7 ), then ( C_7^3 = 35 ), ( C_6^3 = 20 ), and ( C_6^4 = 15 ). So, ( 20 + 15 = 35 ). Yes, that works out. So, the value of ( n ) is 7.**Final Answer**The value of ( n ) is boxed{7}."},{"question":"The lengths of the sides of a triangle with positive area are  log_{10} 12 ,  log_{10} 75 , and  log_{10} n , where  n  is a positive integer. Find the number of possible values for  n .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where the sides of a triangle are given as logarithms: specifically, log base 10 of 12, log base 10 of 75, and log base 10 of n, where n is a positive integer. I need to find how many possible values n can take. Hmm, interesting. I remember that for three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality. That is, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, I think I need to apply that here.First, let me write down the sides:- Side a: log₁₀(12)- Side b: log₁₀(75)- Side c: log₁₀(n)Since these are logarithms, they are positive numbers because 12, 75, and n are all positive integers greater than 1. So, all sides are positive, which is good because a triangle can't have a side with zero or negative length.Now, the triangle inequalities I need to check are:1. a + b > c2. a + c > b3. b + c > aSubstituting the logarithms into these inequalities:1. log₁₀(12) + log₁₀(75) > log₁₀(n)2. log₁₀(12) + log₁₀(n) > log₁₀(75)3. log₁₀(75) + log₁₀(n) > log₁₀(12)I remember that log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), so I can simplify each inequality:1. log₁₀(12 * 75) > log₁₀(n)2. log₁₀(12 * n) > log₁₀(75)3. log₁₀(75 * n) > log₁₀(12)Calculating 12 * 75: 12*75 is 900, right? So, the first inequality becomes log₁₀(900) > log₁₀(n). Since log is an increasing function, this implies that 900 > n.Similarly, the second inequality: log₁₀(12n) > log₁₀(75) implies that 12n > 75. So, n > 75/12. Let me compute 75 divided by 12: 75 ÷ 12 is 6.25. So, n must be greater than 6.25.The third inequality: log₁₀(75n) > log₁₀(12) implies that 75n > 12. So, n > 12/75. 12 divided by 75 is 0.16. But since n is a positive integer, n must be at least 1. But since the second inequality already requires n > 6.25, the third inequality doesn't add any new information because n has to be greater than 6.25, which is more restrictive than n > 0.16.So, combining the inequalities, n must be greater than 6.25 and less than 900. But n has to be an integer, so n can be 7, 8, 9, ..., up to 899. Wait, is that correct?Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So, n must satisfy 6.25 < n < 900. Since n is an integer, the smallest integer greater than 6.25 is 7, and the largest integer less than 900 is 899. So, n can take integer values from 7 to 899 inclusive.Now, to find the number of possible integer values for n, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and add 1 (since both endpoints are inclusive). So, 899 - 7 + 1 = 893. Hmm, so 893 possible values? That seems a lot, but let me verify.Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Because the triangle inequality is not just about the sum of two sides being greater than the third, but also about the difference. Wait, no, actually, the triangle inequality is only about the sum. The difference is implicitly handled because if the sum of two sides is greater than the third, then the third side is less than the sum, which also implies that the third side is greater than the difference of the other two sides. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the difference here.But let me think again. Let's re-examine the inequalities:1. log₁₀(12) + log₁₀(75) > log₁₀(n) => log₁₀(900) > log₁₀(n) => n < 9002. log₁₀(12) + log₁₀(n) > log₁₀(75) => log₁₀(12n) > log₁₀(75) => 12n > 75 => n > 75/12 = 6.253. log₁₀(75) + log₁₀(n) > log₁₀(12) => log₁₀(75n) > log₁₀(12) => 75n > 12 => n > 12/75 = 0.16So, combining these, n must be greater than 6.25 and less than 900. Since n is an integer, n can be 7, 8, 9, ..., 899. So, the number of integers from 7 to 899 inclusive is 899 - 7 + 1 = 893.Wait, but 899 - 7 is 892, plus 1 is 893. So, 893 possible values. Hmm, that seems correct.But let me think again. Maybe I should check if the triangle inequality holds for the logs. Because sometimes, when dealing with logs, the triangle inequality might not directly translate as I thought.Wait, no, because if a, b, c are sides of a triangle, then a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. Since a, b, c are logs, which are positive, the inequalities should hold as I translated them.But just to be thorough, let me think about the properties of logarithms. Since log is a monotonically increasing function, if x > y, then log(x) > log(y). So, if I have log(a) + log(b) > log(c), that's equivalent to log(ab) > log(c), which implies ab > c. So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, the inequalities I set up are correct. So, n must satisfy 6.25 < n < 900, so n can be integers from 7 to 899 inclusive, which is 893 integers.Wait, but hold on. The problem says the triangle has positive area, which just means it's a non-degenerate triangle, so the inequalities must be strict. So, n must be strictly less than 900 and strictly greater than 6.25. So, n can't be 6.25 or 900, which is already considered because n is an integer. So, n starts at 7 and goes up to 899.Therefore, the number of possible integer values is 899 - 7 + 1 = 893.Wait, but I just thought of something. The sides are log₁₀(12), log₁₀(75), and log₁₀(n). So, is there any chance that the logs could be negative? Well, since 12, 75, and n are all greater than 1, their logs are positive. So, all sides are positive, so we don't have to worry about that.But let me just make sure that I didn't miss any other constraints. For example, is there a possibility that log₁₀(n) could be equal to log₁₀(12) + log₁₀(75)? But no, because that would make the triangle degenerate, which is not allowed since the area must be positive. So, n must be strictly less than 900.Similarly, n must be strictly greater than 6.25, so n can't be 6 or lower.Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct: n can take integer values from 7 to 899 inclusive, which is 893 values.Wait, but let me compute 899 - 7 + 1 again to make sure. 899 minus 7 is 892, plus 1 is 893. Yeah, that's correct.But just to double-check, let's take n=7 and see if it satisfies all triangle inequalities.Compute the sides:log₁₀(12) ≈ 1.07918log₁₀(75) ≈ 1.87506log₁₀(7) ≈ 0.845098Now, check the triangle inequalities:1. 1.07918 + 1.87506 ≈ 2.95424 > 0.845098 ✔️2. 1.07918 + 0.845098 ≈ 1.92428 > 1.87506 ✔️3. 1.87506 + 0.845098 ≈ 2.72016 > 1.07918 ✔️So, n=7 works.Now, let's check n=899.log₁₀(899) ≈ 2.9535So, sides are approximately:1.07918, 1.87506, 2.9535Check inequalities:1. 1.07918 + 1.87506 ≈ 2.95424 > 2.9535 ✔️ (barely, but it's still greater)2. 1.07918 + 2.9535 ≈ 4.03268 > 1.87506 ✔️3. 1.87506 + 2.9535 ≈ 4.82856 > 1.07918 ✔️So, n=899 also works.What about n=900? log₁₀(900) ≈ 2.95424, which is equal to the sum of log₁₀(12) and log₁₀(75), so that would make the triangle degenerate, which is not allowed. So, n=900 is excluded.Similarly, n=6: log₁₀(6) ≈ 0.778151Check the inequalities:1. 1.07918 + 1.87506 ≈ 2.95424 > 0.778151 ✔️2. 1.07918 + 0.778151 ≈ 1.85733 < 1.87506 ✖️So, n=6 doesn't satisfy the second inequality, so it's excluded.Therefore, n must be from 7 to 899 inclusive, giving 893 possible integer values.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me think about whether there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using properties of logarithms or exponents.Alternatively, since the sides are logs, maybe we can exponentiate both sides to turn the inequalities into multiplicative inequalities.But actually, that's exactly what I did earlier. Because log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), so the inequalities translate to ab > c, etc.So, I think my approach is solid.Therefore, I think the number of possible integer values for n is 893.**Final Answer**The number of possible values for ( n ) is boxed{893}."},{"question":"Find all natural numbers ( n ) such that ( n^{4} + 4^{n} ) is prime.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem: Find all natural numbers ( n ) such that ( n^{4} + 4^{n} ) is prime. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First off, natural numbers are positive integers, so ( n ) can be 1, 2, 3, and so on. I need to check for each ( n ) whether ( n^4 + 4^n ) results in a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, my goal is to find all such ( n ) where this expression is prime.Let me start by testing small values of ( n ) because sometimes these problems have only small solutions, and it's easier to check them manually.**Case 1: ( n = 1 )**Calculating ( 1^4 + 4^1 ):( 1 + 4 = 5 ). Okay, 5 is a prime number. So, ( n = 1 ) is a solution.**Case 2: ( n = 2 )**Calculating ( 2^4 + 4^2 ):( 16 + 16 = 32 ). Hmm, 32 is not a prime number because it's divisible by 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. So, ( n = 2 ) is not a solution.**Case 3: ( n = 3 )**Calculating ( 3^4 + 4^3 ):( 81 + 64 = 145 ). Now, is 145 prime? Let's check. 145 divided by 5 is 29, so 145 = 5 × 29. Therefore, it's not prime. So, ( n = 3 ) is out.**Case 4: ( n = 4 )**Calculating ( 4^4 + 4^4 ):( 256 + 256 = 512 ). 512 is definitely not prime; it's a power of 2. So, ( n = 4 ) doesn't work.**Case 5: ( n = 5 )**Calculating ( 5^4 + 4^5 ):( 625 + 1024 = 1649 ). Hmm, is 1649 prime? Let me see. I need to check divisibility. Let's try dividing by small primes.First, check if it's even: 1649 is odd, so not divisible by 2.Sum of digits: 1 + 6 + 4 + 9 = 20, which isn't divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3.Ends with a 9, so not divisible by 5.Check 7: 7 × 235 = 1645, so 1649 - 1645 = 4, so not divisible by 7.11: 1 - 6 + 4 - 9 = -10, which isn't divisible by 11.13: Let's see, 13 × 126 = 1638, 1649 - 1638 = 11, so not divisible by 13.17: 17 × 97 = 1649? Let me check: 17 × 90 = 1530, 17 × 7 = 119, so 1530 + 119 = 1649. Oh! So, 17 × 97 = 1649. Therefore, 1649 is not prime. So, ( n = 5 ) is out.**Case 6: ( n = 6 )**Calculating ( 6^4 + 4^6 ):( 1296 + 4096 = 5392 ). 5392 is even, so it's divisible by 2, hence not prime.**Case 7: ( n = 7 )**Calculating ( 7^4 + 4^7 ):( 2401 + 16384 = 18785 ). Let's check if this is prime.First, it's odd, so not divisible by 2.Sum of digits: 1 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 5 = 29, not divisible by 3.Ends with 5, so it's divisible by 5. Therefore, 18785 is divisible by 5, hence not prime.**Case 8: ( n = 8 )**Calculating ( 8^4 + 4^8 ):( 4096 + 65536 = 69632 ). 69632 is even, so not prime.**Case 9: ( n = 9 )**Calculating ( 9^4 + 4^9 ):( 6561 + 262144 = 268705 ). Let's see:Ends with 5, so divisible by 5. Not prime.**Case 10: ( n = 10 )**Calculating ( 10^4 + 4^{10} ):( 10000 + 1048576 = 1058576 ). Even number, so not prime.Hmm, so far, only ( n = 1 ) gives a prime. Maybe I should check ( n = 0 ) as well, but wait, natural numbers usually start from 1, so 0 might not be considered here. But just in case, let's check ( n = 0 ):Calculating ( 0^4 + 4^0 = 0 + 1 = 1 ). 1 is not prime, so even if we consider 0, it's not a solution.Wait, but maybe I should check ( n = 11 ) just to be thorough.**Case 11: ( n = 11 )**Calculating ( 11^4 + 4^{11} ):( 14641 + 4194304 = 4194304 + 14641 = 4208945 ). Let's check if this is prime.It's odd, so not divisible by 2.Sum of digits: 4 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 9 + 4 + 5 = 32, not divisible by 3.Ends with 5, so divisible by 5. Therefore, not prime.Hmm, okay, seems like as ( n ) increases, ( 4^n ) grows exponentially, while ( n^4 ) grows polynomially. So, for larger ( n ), ( 4^n ) will dominate, making the sum very large. But large numbers can sometimes be prime, but it's less likely. However, I need a more general approach rather than testing each ( n ).Maybe I can analyze the expression ( n^4 + 4^n ) for different cases.First, note that ( 4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n} ). So, ( n^4 + 2^{2n} ). Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression or find some pattern.Wait, ( n^4 + 4^n ) can sometimes be written as a sum of squares or something similar. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I can consider modulo operations to see if the expression is composite for certain ( n ).Let me check the parity. If ( n ) is even, then ( n^4 ) is even, and ( 4^n ) is also even, so their sum is even. The only even prime is 2, so if ( n ) is even, ( n^4 + 4^n ) must be 2 to be prime. Let's see if that's possible.Suppose ( n ) is even. Then ( n = 2k ) for some integer ( k ).So, ( n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 ), which is divisible by 16.( 4^n = 4^{2k} = (4^k)^2 ), which is also divisible by 16 when ( k geq 2 ).Wait, actually, ( 4^n ) is always divisible by 4, but for ( n geq 2 ), it's divisible by 16.So, ( n^4 + 4^n ) when ( n ) is even and ( n geq 2 ) is divisible by 16, but let's check:Wait, ( n^4 ) when ( n ) is even is divisible by 16 only if ( n ) is divisible by 2, but actually, ( n^4 ) is divisible by 16 if ( n ) is even because ( (2k)^4 = 16k^4 ). Similarly, ( 4^n ) is ( (2^2)^n = 2^{2n} ), which is divisible by 16 for ( n geq 2 ).So, for even ( n geq 2 ), both terms are divisible by 16, so their sum is divisible by 16. Thus, ( n^4 + 4^n ) is divisible by 16, which is greater than 2, so it can't be prime.Therefore, for even ( n geq 2 ), ( n^4 + 4^n ) is composite.So, the only possible even ( n ) that could give a prime is ( n = 2 ), but we already checked ( n = 2 ) and found it gives 32, which is not prime.Thus, all even ( n geq 2 ) are out. So, we only need to consider odd ( n ).So, let me now focus on odd ( n ). Let me denote ( n = 2k + 1 ) where ( k geq 0 ).So, ( n^4 + 4^n = (2k + 1)^4 + 4^{2k + 1} ).Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression or find some pattern.Wait, another approach: Maybe using the fact that ( a^4 + 4b^4 ) can be factored as ( (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) ). Is that applicable here?Let me recall: The sum of squares can sometimes be factored using complex numbers, but in integers, certain forms can be factored.Yes, the Sophie Germain identity: ( a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) ). So, if I can write ( n^4 + 4^n ) in the form ( a^4 + 4b^4 ), then it can be factored.Let me see: ( n^4 + 4^n = n^4 + (2^{n})^2 ). Hmm, not directly. Wait, ( 4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n} ). So, ( n^4 + 2^{2n} ).Wait, if I set ( a = n ) and ( b = 2^{n/2} ), then ( a^4 + 4b^4 = n^4 + 4*(2^{n/2})^4 = n^4 + 4*2^{2n} = n^4 + 2^{2n + 2} ). Hmm, not quite the same as ( n^4 + 4^n ) unless ( 2n + 2 = n ), which would imply ( n = -2 ), which isn't natural.Alternatively, maybe another way to factor.Wait, perhaps for specific exponents, we can factor the expression.Alternatively, let's consider modulo 5.Because primes are mostly not divisible by 5, except 5 itself. So, if ( n^4 + 4^n ) is divisible by 5 and greater than 5, it's composite.Let me compute ( n^4 ) modulo 5 and ( 4^n ) modulo 5.First, ( n^4 ) modulo 5: By Fermat's little theorem, for any integer ( n ), ( n^4 equiv 0 ) or ( 1 ) modulo 5.Because if ( n ) is not divisible by 5, then ( n^4 equiv 1 mod 5 ). If ( n ) is divisible by 5, ( n^4 equiv 0 mod 5 ).Similarly, ( 4^n ) modulo 5: Let's compute powers of 4 modulo 5.4^1 ≡ 4 mod 54^2 ≡ 16 ≡ 1 mod 54^3 ≡ 4*1 ≡ 4 mod 54^4 ≡ 4*4 ≡ 16 ≡ 1 mod 5So, the pattern cycles every 2: 4, 1, 4, 1,...So, if ( n ) is odd, ( 4^n ≡ 4 mod 5 )If ( n ) is even, ( 4^n ≡ 1 mod 5 )So, let's compute ( n^4 + 4^n ) modulo 5 for odd ( n ):Case 1: ( n ) is odd and not divisible by 5.Then, ( n^4 ≡ 1 mod 5 ), and ( 4^n ≡ 4 mod 5 ). So, total ≡ 1 + 4 ≡ 0 mod 5.Thus, ( n^4 + 4^n ) is divisible by 5.If ( n^4 + 4^n ) is divisible by 5 and greater than 5, it's composite.So, when is ( n^4 + 4^n ) equal to 5? Let's check for small odd ( n ):- ( n = 1 ): 1 + 4 = 5, which is prime.- ( n = 3 ): 81 + 64 = 145, which is 5 × 29, so composite.- ( n = 5 ): 625 + 1024 = 1649, which is 17 × 97, composite.- ( n = 7 ): 2401 + 16384 = 18785, which is 5 × 3757, composite.So, for odd ( n geq 3 ), ( n^4 + 4^n ) is divisible by 5 and greater than 5, hence composite.Therefore, the only possible ( n ) is 1.Wait, but let me confirm for ( n = 5 ): 625 + 1024 = 1649. Is 1649 divisible by 5? Yes, because it ends with a 9, wait, no, 1649 ends with a 9, which isn't divisible by 5. Wait, but earlier we saw that 1649 is 17 × 97, but according to the modulo 5 argument, it should be divisible by 5.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the modulo 5 calculation.Wait, for ( n = 5 ), which is odd and divisible by 5.So, ( n^4 ≡ 0 mod 5 ), and ( 4^n ≡ 4 mod 5 ). So, total ≡ 0 + 4 ≡ 4 mod 5.Wait, so my earlier conclusion was wrong. If ( n ) is divisible by 5, then ( n^4 ≡ 0 mod 5 ), and ( 4^n ≡ 4 mod 5 ) if ( n ) is odd.So, total ≡ 4 mod 5, which is not 0. So, my earlier reasoning was incorrect.Wait, so I need to adjust my approach.So, when ( n ) is odd:- If ( n ) is not divisible by 5, then ( n^4 + 4^n ≡ 1 + 4 ≡ 0 mod 5 ). So, divisible by 5.- If ( n ) is divisible by 5, then ( n^4 ≡ 0 mod 5 ), and ( 4^n ≡ 4 mod 5 ) (since ( n ) is odd). So, total ≡ 4 mod 5, which is not 0. So, not divisible by 5.Therefore, for odd ( n ):- If ( n ) is not divisible by 5, ( n^4 + 4^n ) is divisible by 5 and greater than 5, hence composite.- If ( n ) is divisible by 5, then ( n^4 + 4^n ) is not divisible by 5, so it might be prime.So, in addition to ( n = 1 ), which is not divisible by 5, but gave a prime, we might have other solutions where ( n ) is divisible by 5.Wait, but ( n = 5 ) gave 1649, which is 17 × 97, so composite. Let me check ( n = 15 ), which is divisible by 5 and odd.Calculating ( 15^4 + 4^{15} ):15^4 = 506254^15 = 1073741824So, 50625 + 1073741824 = 1073792449Is this prime? Hmm, that's a big number. Let me check divisibility by small primes.First, check if it's even: No, it's odd.Sum of digits: 1 + 0 + 7 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 9 = 46, which isn't divisible by 3.Ends with 9, so not divisible by 5.Check divisibility by 7: Let's see, 1073792449 divided by 7. 7 × 153398921 = 1073792447, so remainder 2. Not divisible by 7.11: Alternating sum: 1 - 0 + 7 - 3 + 7 - 9 + 2 - 4 + 4 - 9 = 1 +7 -3 +7 -9 +2 -4 +4 -9 = 1 +7=8, 8-3=5, 5+7=12, 12-9=3, 3+2=5, 5-4=1, 1+4=5, 5-9=-4. Not divisible by 11.13: Let me try dividing 1073792449 by 13. 13 × 82599419 = 1073792447, so remainder 2. Not divisible by 13.17: 17 × 63164261 = 1073792437, remainder 12. Not divisible by 17.19: Let me see, 19 × 56515391 = 1073792429, remainder 20. Not divisible by 19.23: 23 × 46686628 = 1073792444, remainder 5. Not divisible by 23.29: 29 × 37027325 = 1073792425, remainder 24. Not divisible by 29.31: 31 × 34638465 = 1073792415, remainder 34. Not divisible by 31.Hmm, this is getting tedious. Maybe I can check if it's a perfect square or something.Wait, sqrt(1073792449) is approximately 32768. Let me check 32768^2 = 1073741824, which is less than 1073792449. 32769^2 = (32768 + 1)^2 = 32768^2 + 2×32768 + 1 = 1073741824 + 65536 + 1 = 1073807361, which is greater than 1073792449. So, it's not a perfect square.Alternatively, maybe it's a prime. But given how large it is, it's unlikely, but I can't be sure without more advanced methods.Alternatively, maybe I can use some other modular arithmetic to check.Wait, let's compute ( n^4 + 4^n ) modulo 3.For ( n ) odd and divisible by 5, let's see:( n ) is odd, so ( n = 2k + 1 ).Compute ( n^4 mod 3 ):If ( n ≡ 0 mod 3 ), then ( n^4 ≡ 0 mod 3 ).If ( n ≡ 1 mod 3 ), ( n^4 ≡ 1 mod 3 ).If ( n ≡ 2 mod 3 ), ( n^4 ≡ (2)^4 = 16 ≡ 1 mod 3 ).So, ( n^4 ≡ 0 ) or ( 1 mod 3 ).Similarly, ( 4^n mod 3 ):4 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 4^n ≡ 1^n ≡ 1 mod 3.Thus, ( n^4 + 4^n ≡ (0 or 1) + 1 ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3 ).So, if ( n ≡ 0 mod 3 ), then ( n^4 + 4^n ≡ 1 mod 3 ).If ( n ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3 ), then ( n^4 + 4^n ≡ 2 mod 3 ).So, it's either 1 or 2 mod 3, meaning it's not divisible by 3 unless it's 3 itself.So, for ( n ) divisible by 5 and odd, ( n^4 + 4^n ) is not divisible by 3 or 5, but could be divisible by other primes.But without a clear pattern, it's hard to tell. Maybe another approach.Wait, let's consider that for ( n geq 5 ), ( 4^n ) grows much faster than ( n^4 ), so ( n^4 + 4^n ) is going to be a very large number, and the probability that it's prime decreases as numbers get larger.But still, some large numbers can be prime. However, given that for ( n ) odd and not divisible by 5, the expression is divisible by 5, so composite. For ( n ) odd and divisible by 5, we have to check individually.But even so, for ( n = 5 ), we saw it's composite. For ( n = 15 ), it's a huge number, but I don't know if it's prime.Wait, perhaps I can look for another pattern or factorization.Wait, another idea: Maybe express ( n^4 + 4^n ) as a sum of two squares or something similar, but I don't see an immediate way.Alternatively, think about the expression when ( n ) is a multiple of 4 plus 1 or something.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that ( 4^n = (2^n)^2 ), so ( n^4 + (2^n)^2 ). Hmm, sum of squares.But sum of squares can sometimes be factored in complex numbers, but not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, maybe for ( n ) odd, ( n^4 + 4^n ) can be factored as a product of two integers greater than 1, making it composite.Wait, let me think about the case when ( n ) is odd and not divisible by 5: we already saw that ( n^4 + 4^n ) is divisible by 5, hence composite.When ( n ) is odd and divisible by 5: ( n = 5k ), where ( k ) is odd (since ( n ) is odd). Then, ( n = 5k ), so ( n^4 = (5k)^4 = 625k^4 ), and ( 4^n = 4^{5k} = (4^5)^k = 1024^k ).So, ( n^4 + 4^n = 625k^4 + 1024^k ). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, maybe I can consider specific cases where ( k = 1 ), which is ( n = 5 ), which we saw is composite. For ( k = 3 ), ( n = 15 ), which is a huge number, but perhaps it's composite as well.Alternatively, maybe for ( n ) divisible by 5, ( n^4 + 4^n ) can be expressed as a multiple of another number.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ( 4^n = (2^n)^2 ), so ( n^4 + (2^n)^2 ). Maybe this can be expressed as a product.Wait, another idea: Maybe using the identity ( a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) ). Let me see if I can write ( n^4 + 4^n ) in this form.Let me set ( a = n ) and ( b = 2^{n/2} ). Then, ( a^4 + 4b^4 = n^4 + 4*(2^{n/2})^4 = n^4 + 4*2^{2n} = n^4 + 2^{2n + 2} ). Hmm, but we have ( n^4 + 4^n = n^4 + 2^{2n} ). So, unless ( 2n + 2 = 2n ), which is not possible, this doesn't directly apply.Alternatively, maybe another substitution.Wait, perhaps if ( n ) is even, but we already saw that for even ( n geq 2 ), the expression is composite.Wait, another approach: Let me consider the expression for ( n ) odd and divisible by 5.Let me denote ( n = 5m ), where ( m ) is an odd integer (since ( n ) is odd).So, ( n = 5m ), ( m geq 1 ).Then, ( n^4 + 4^n = (5m)^4 + 4^{5m} = 625m^4 + (4^5)^m = 625m^4 + 1024^m ).Hmm, 1024 is 2^10, so 1024^m = 2^{10m}.So, ( n^4 + 4^n = 625m^4 + 2^{10m} ).Not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can factor this expression.Wait, 625 is 5^4, so ( 625m^4 = (5m)^4 ). So, ( (5m)^4 + (2^{5m})^2 ). Hmm, sum of squares again.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as ( (5m)^4 + (2^{5m})^2 = (5m)^4 + (32^m)^2 ). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe use the Sophie Germain identity on this.Wait, the Sophie Germain identity is ( a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) ). So, if I can write ( (5m)^4 + 4*(something)^4 ), then I can factor it.Wait, ( (5m)^4 + 4*(something)^4 = (5m)^4 + 4b^4 ). So, if I set ( b = 2^{5m/2} ), but then ( b ) has to be an integer, so ( 5m ) must be even, but ( m ) is odd, so ( 5m ) is odd, which makes ( 5m/2 ) not integer. So, that approach doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe another identity.Wait, perhaps if I write ( n^4 + 4^n = n^4 + (2^n)^2 ). Maybe this can be expressed as a product of two terms.Wait, another identity: ( a^2 + b^2 = (a + bi)(a - bi) ), but that's in complex numbers, which doesn't help for integer factorization.Alternatively, maybe using the sum of squares formula with some substitution.Alternatively, maybe consider that for ( n ) odd and divisible by 5, ( n^4 + 4^n ) is even? Wait, no, ( n ) is odd, so ( n^4 ) is odd, and ( 4^n ) is even (since 4 is even, any power of 4 is even). So, odd + even = odd. So, the sum is odd, so not divisible by 2.But earlier, we saw that for ( n ) odd and not divisible by 5, it's divisible by 5, hence composite. For ( n ) odd and divisible by 5, it's not divisible by 5, but may be divisible by other primes.Wait, but for ( n = 5 ), we saw it's composite, for ( n = 15 ), it's a huge number, but likely composite as well.Wait, maybe another approach: Let's consider that for ( n geq 5 ), ( 4^n ) is a multiple of 16, and ( n^4 ) is also a multiple of 16 if ( n ) is even, but for odd ( n ), ( n^4 ) is 1 mod 16.Wait, let's compute ( n^4 mod 16 ) for odd ( n ):Any odd number can be written as ( 2k + 1 ).So, ( (2k + 1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 1 ). Modulo 16, this is 1.So, ( n^4 ≡ 1 mod 16 ) for odd ( n ).Similarly, ( 4^n mod 16 ):For ( n geq 2 ), ( 4^n ) is 0 mod 16.Wait, ( 4^1 = 4 mod 164^2 = 16 ≡ 0 mod 164^3 = 64 ≡ 0 mod 16So, for ( n geq 2 ), ( 4^n ≡ 0 mod 16 ).Thus, for odd ( n geq 3 ):( n^4 + 4^n ≡ 1 + 0 ≡ 1 mod 16 ). So, it's 1 mod 16, which doesn't give us much information.But for ( n = 1 ):( 1 + 4 = 5 ≡ 5 mod 16 ).So, not helpful.Wait, another idea: Let's consider that for ( n geq 5 ), ( 4^n ) is a multiple of 1024, which is 2^10. So, ( 4^n = 2^{2n} ). So, for ( n geq 5 ), ( 2n geq 10 ), so ( 4^n ) is divisible by 1024.Meanwhile, ( n^4 ) is much smaller than ( 4^n ) for large ( n ), but for ( n = 5 ), ( n^4 = 625 ), which is less than ( 4^5 = 1024 ).So, ( n^4 + 4^n ) is roughly ( 4^n ) for large ( n ), which is a power of 2, but not a prime unless ( 4^n ) is 2, which only happens when ( n = 1 ), but ( 4^1 = 4 ), which is not prime.Wait, but ( 4^n ) is a power of 2 only when ( n = 0 ), which isn't natural, or ( n = 1 ), which gives 4, not prime.Wait, but ( 4^n ) is always even, except when ( n = 0 ). So, ( n^4 + 4^n ) is even only when ( n ) is even, but for odd ( n ), it's odd.Wait, but for odd ( n geq 3 ), we saw that ( n^4 + 4^n ) is either divisible by 5 or not, but for ( n ) divisible by 5, it's not divisible by 5, but may be composite for other reasons.Wait, maybe I can use the fact that for ( n geq 5 ), ( n^4 + 4^n ) is greater than 5 and either divisible by 5 or not, but in either case, it's composite.Wait, but for ( n = 5 ), it's 1649, which is composite. For ( n = 7 ), it's 18785, which is composite. For ( n = 9 ), it's 268705, which is composite. For ( n = 11 ), it's 4208945, which is composite.So, perhaps the only solution is ( n = 1 ).Wait, but let me check ( n = 5 ) again. 5^4 + 4^5 = 625 + 1024 = 1649. 1649 divided by 17 is 97, so 17 × 97 = 1649. So, composite.Similarly, ( n = 7 ): 7^4 + 4^7 = 2401 + 16384 = 18785. 18785 divided by 5 is 3757. 3757: Let's check if it's prime. 3757 divided by 13 is 289, because 13 × 289 = 3757. Wait, 289 is 17^2, so 3757 = 13 × 17^2. So, 18785 = 5 × 13 × 17^2, composite.Similarly, ( n = 9 ): 9^4 + 4^9 = 6561 + 262144 = 268705. 268705 divided by 5 is 53741. Check if 53741 is prime. Let's see, 53741 divided by 7: 7 × 7677 = 53739, remainder 2. Not divisible by 7. Divided by 11: 11 × 4885 = 53735, remainder 6. Not divisible by 11. Divided by 13: 13 × 4133 = 53729, remainder 12. Not divisible by 13. Divided by 17: 17 × 3161 = 53737, remainder 4. Not divisible by 17. Divided by 19: 19 × 2828 = 53732, remainder 9. Not divisible by 19. Hmm, maybe it's prime? Wait, 53741: Let me check sqrt(53741) ≈ 232. So, I need to check primes up to 233.Wait, 53741 divided by 23: 23 × 2336 = 53728, remainder 13. Not divisible by 23.29: 29 × 1853 = 53737, remainder 4. Not divisible by 29.31: 31 × 1733 = 53723, remainder 18. Not divisible by 31.37: 37 × 1452 = 53724, remainder 17. Not divisible by 37.41: 41 × 1310 = 53710, remainder 31. Not divisible by 41.43: 43 × 1250 = 53750, which is higher. So, 43 × 1250 = 53750, so 53741 is 9 less, so not divisible by 43.47: 47 × 1143 = 53721, remainder 20. Not divisible by 47.53: 53 × 1014 = 53742, which is 1 more, so remainder -1. Not divisible by 53.59: 59 × 910 = 53690, remainder 51. Not divisible by 59.61: 61 × 880 = 53680, remainder 61. 61 × 881 = 53680 + 61 = 53741. So, 61 × 881 = 53741. Therefore, 53741 is composite, so 268705 is composite.So, ( n = 9 ) is composite.Similarly, ( n = 11 ): 11^4 + 4^11 = 14641 + 4194304 = 4208945. Let's check if this is prime.Divided by 5: Ends with 5, so yes, 5 × 841789 = 4208945. So, composite.So, it seems like for all ( n geq 2 ), ( n^4 + 4^n ) is composite. The only exception is ( n = 1 ), which gives 5, a prime.Therefore, the only natural number ( n ) such that ( n^4 + 4^n ) is prime is ( n = 1 )."},{"question":"Find the number of the form 7x36y5 that is divisible by 1375.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of the form 7x36y5 that's divisible by 1375. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.First, let me understand the structure of the number. It's a six-digit number where the first digit is 7, the second is unknown (x), the third is 3, the fourth is 6, the fifth is unknown (y), and the sixth is 5. So, it looks like 7 x 3 6 y 5. Got it.Now, the number needs to be divisible by 1375. I remember that 1375 is a specific number, but I should probably factor it to understand what divisibility rules apply here. Let me factor 1375. 1375 divided by 5 is 275. 275 divided by 5 is 55. 55 divided by 5 is 11. So, 1375 is 5^3 * 11. That means the number must be divisible by both 5^3 (which is 125) and 11. So, I need to find a number 7x36y5 that's divisible by both 125 and 11.Let me tackle the divisibility by 125 first because that might be simpler. I remember that a number is divisible by 125 if its last three digits form a number that's divisible by 125. So, in this case, the last three digits are 6y5. Therefore, the number formed by 6y5 must be divisible by 125.Let me write that down: 6y5 must be divisible by 125. So, I need to find the digit y such that 6y5 is divisible by 125. Since y is a single digit (0-9), I can list the possible numbers and check which ones are divisible by 125.Let me list the possible numbers:- If y=0: 605- If y=1: 615- If y=2: 625- If y=3: 635- If y=4: 645- If y=5: 655- If y=6: 665- If y=7: 675- If y=8: 685- If y=9: 695Now, let's check which of these are divisible by 125.125 times 4 is 500, 125 times 5 is 625, 125 times 6 is 750, and so on. So, looking at the numbers above, 625 is 125*5, which is 625. So, when y=2, 6y5 becomes 625, which is divisible by 125. Are there any others? Let's see:- 605: 605 divided by 125 is 4.84, not an integer.- 615: 615/125 = 4.92, not integer.- 625: 625/125 = 5, which is good.- 635: 635/125 = 5.08, nope.- 645: 645/125 = 5.16, nope.- 655: 655/125 = 5.24, nope.- 665: 665/125 = 5.32, nope.- 675: 675/125 = 5.4, nope.- 685: 685/125 = 5.48, nope.- 695: 695/125 = 5.56, nope.So, only when y=2 does 6y5 become 625, which is divisible by 125. Therefore, y must be 2.Okay, so now we know y=2. So, the number is 7x3625. Now, we need to find x such that 7x3625 is divisible by 11. Because 1375 is 125*11, and we've already satisfied the 125 part, now we need to satisfy the 11 part.I remember the divisibility rule for 11 is that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions should be a multiple of 11 (including zero). Let me write that down.So, for the number 7x3625, let's assign positions from left to right:Position 1: 7Position 2: xPosition 3: 3Position 4: 6Position 5: 2Position 6: 5So, the odd positions are 1, 3, 5: digits 7, 3, 2.The even positions are 2, 4, 6: digits x, 6, 5.So, sum of odd positions: 7 + 3 + 2 = 12.Sum of even positions: x + 6 + 5 = x + 11.According to the divisibility rule, the difference between these sums should be a multiple of 11 (including zero). So, (sum of odd) - (sum of even) = 12 - (x + 11) = 1 - x.This difference, 1 - x, must be a multiple of 11. So, 1 - x = 11k, where k is an integer.Since x is a single digit (0-9), let's find possible values of x.So, 1 - x = 11k.Let me solve for x:x = 1 - 11k.Now, x must be between 0 and 9, inclusive. So, let's find integer k such that x is in that range.Let's test k=0: x=1 - 0=1. Okay, that's valid.k=1: x=1 -11= -10. Not valid, since x can't be negative.k=-1: x=1 - (-11)=12. Not valid, since x must be a single digit.So, the only possible value is k=0, which gives x=1.Therefore, x must be 1.So, putting it all together, the number is 7 1 3 6 2 5, which is 713625.Let me double-check if 713625 is divisible by 1375.First, divide 713625 by 1375.Let me compute 1375 * 520 = ?1375 * 500 = 6875001375 * 20 = 27500So, 687500 + 27500 = 715000.Wait, that's 1375*520=715000.But our number is 713625, which is less than 715000.So, 715000 - 713625 = 1375.So, 713625 = 715000 - 1375 = 1375*(520 - 1) = 1375*519.Yes, so 1375*519=713625. Therefore, it is divisible by 1375.Just to make sure, let me verify the divisibility rules again.Divisibility by 125: Last three digits are 625, which is 5^3, so yes.Divisibility by 11: Sum of odd positions: 7 + 3 + 2 =12. Sum of even positions:1 +6 +5=12. Difference is 12 -12=0, which is a multiple of 11. So, yes, it satisfies both.Therefore, the number is 713625, with x=1 and y=2.I think that's the only possible number because when we solved for y, we found only y=2 works, and for x, only x=1 works. So, there's only one such number.**Final Answer**The number is boxed{713625}."},{"question":"Given a > 0, b > 0, and a+b=1, find the minimum value of dfrac{1}{a} + dfrac{1}{b}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Given that a and b are both positive numbers, and their sum is 1, I need to find the minimum value of the expression 1/a + 1/b. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that a and b are positive and add up to 1. So, a + b = 1. That means b = 1 - a. Maybe I can substitute that into the expression to make it a function of a single variable. Let me try that.So, if I replace b with (1 - a), the expression becomes 1/a + 1/(1 - a). Now, I have a function f(a) = 1/a + 1/(1 - a). I need to find the minimum value of this function for a in the interval (0,1), since a and b are both positive.To find the minimum, I can use calculus. I'll take the derivative of f(a) with respect to a, set it equal to zero, and solve for a. That should give me the critical points, and then I can check if it's a minimum.Let's compute the derivative. The derivative of 1/a is -1/a², and the derivative of 1/(1 - a) is 1/(1 - a)² because of the chain rule. So, f'(a) = -1/a² + 1/(1 - a)².Now, set f'(a) equal to zero:-1/a² + 1/(1 - a)² = 0Let me rearrange this equation:1/(1 - a)² = 1/a²Taking reciprocals on both sides:(1 - a)² = a²Expanding the left side:1 - 2a + a² = a²Subtract a² from both sides:1 - 2a = 0So, 1 = 2a, which means a = 1/2.Since a = 1/2, then b = 1 - a = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 as well. So, both a and b are 1/2.Now, let's compute the value of the expression at a = 1/2:1/(1/2) + 1/(1/2) = 2 + 2 = 4.So, the minimum value is 4.Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I should check the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum.The second derivative of f(a) would be the derivative of f'(a). Let's compute that.f'(a) = -1/a² + 1/(1 - a)²So, f''(a) is the derivative of -1/a², which is 2/a³, plus the derivative of 1/(1 - a)², which is 2/(1 - a)³.So, f''(a) = 2/a³ + 2/(1 - a)³.Since a is between 0 and 1, both terms are positive because a³ and (1 - a)³ are positive. Therefore, f''(a) is positive, which means the function is concave upward at a = 1/2, confirming that it's a minimum.Alternatively, I could use the AM-HM inequality. The harmonic mean of a and b is 2/(1/a + 1/b), and the arithmetic mean is (a + b)/2 = 1/2. By the AM-HM inequality, AM ≥ HM, so 1/2 ≥ 2/(1/a + 1/b). Rearranging, 1/a + 1/b ≥ 4. So, the minimum value is 4, achieved when a = b = 1/2.Another approach could be using the method of Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill for this problem. Since we have only two variables and a simple constraint, substitution worked well.I could also think about it graphically. The function f(a) = 1/a + 1/(1 - a) has a vertical asymptote at a = 0 and a = 1. It's symmetric around a = 1/2 because swapping a and b doesn't change the expression. So, the function should have its minimum at a = 1/2.Let me test some values to see if this makes sense. If a = 1/3, then b = 2/3. Then, 1/a + 1/b = 3 + 3/2 = 4.5, which is more than 4. If a = 1/4, then b = 3/4, and 1/a + 1/b = 4 + 4/3 ≈ 5.333, which is even larger. If a approaches 0, 1/a approaches infinity, so the expression becomes very large. Similarly, if a approaches 1, 1/(1 - a) approaches infinity. So, it seems that the expression indeed has a minimum at a = 1/2.Wait, what if a = 1/2? Then, as calculated earlier, the expression is 4, which is less than the other values I tested. So, that seems consistent.Is there another way to see this? Maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let's see. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that (a + b)(1/a + 1/b) ≥ (1 + 1)^2 = 4. Since a + b = 1, we have 1*(1/a + 1/b) ≥ 4, so 1/a + 1/b ≥ 4. Equality holds when a = b, which is when a = b = 1/2. So, that's another way to confirm the minimum is 4.Wow, so multiple methods lead to the same conclusion. That gives me more confidence that 4 is indeed the minimum value.Just to recap, I used substitution to express the function in terms of a single variable, took the derivative to find the critical point, checked the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum, and also applied the AM-HM inequality and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to verify the result. All methods point to the same answer.I think I've covered all the bases here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the different approaches reinforce each other. So, I'm pretty sure the minimum value is 4.**Final Answer**The minimum value is boxed{4}."},{"question":"A flock of geese is flying, and a lone goose flies towards them and says, \\"Hello, a hundred geese!\\" The leader of the flock responds, \\"No, we are not a hundred geese! If there were as many of us as there are now, plus the same amount, plus half of that amount, plus a quarter of that amount, plus you, goose, then we would be a hundred geese. But as it is...\\" How many geese were in the flock?","answer":"Alright, so I've come across this interesting problem about a flock of geese. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem goes like this: A lone goose flies towards a flock and greets them, saying, \\"Hello, a hundred geese!\\" The leader of the flock responds by saying that they are not a hundred geese. Then the leader gives a riddle: If there were as many geese as there are now, plus the same amount, plus half of that amount, plus a quarter of that amount, plus the lone goose, then they would make a hundred geese. The question is, how many geese were in the flock?Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Let's denote the number of geese in the flock as ( x ). The lone goose is separate, so initially, the flock has ( x ) geese, and the lone goose is just one. The leader says that if they had as many as they are now (( x )), plus the same amount again (( x )), plus half of that amount (( frac{x}{2} )), plus a quarter of that amount (( frac{x}{4} )), plus the lone goose (which is 1), then the total would be 100 geese. So, translating this into an equation, it would be:( x + x + frac{x}{2} + frac{x}{4} + 1 = 100 )Let me write that out:( x + x + frac{x}{2} + frac{x}{4} + 1 = 100 )Simplify the left side:First, combine the ( x ) terms. There's ( x + x ), which is ( 2x ). Then, ( frac{x}{2} ) and ( frac{x}{4} ). To combine these, I can convert them to have a common denominator. ( 2x + frac{x}{2} + frac{x}{4} )Let me express all terms with denominator 4:( 2x = frac{8x}{4} )( frac{x}{2} = frac{2x}{4} )( frac{x}{4} = frac{x}{4} )So, adding them together:( frac{8x}{4} + frac{2x}{4} + frac{x}{4} = frac{11x}{4} )So, the equation becomes:( frac{11x}{4} + 1 = 100 )Now, let's solve for ( x ):Subtract 1 from both sides:( frac{11x}{4} = 99 )Multiply both sides by 4:( 11x = 396 )Divide both sides by 11:( x = 36 )So, according to this, the flock has 36 geese. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with 36 geese:- The same amount: 36- Half of that: 18- A quarter of that: 9- Plus the lone goose: 1Adding them all together: 36 + 36 + 18 + 9 + 1. Let's compute that step by step:36 + 36 = 7272 + 18 = 9090 + 9 = 9999 + 1 = 100Yes, that adds up to 100. So, the calculations seem correct.Wait, but just to make sure I interpreted the problem correctly. The leader says, \\"If there were as many of us as there are now, plus the same amount, plus half of that amount, plus a quarter of that amount, plus you, goose, then we would be a hundred geese.\\" So, the \\"us\\" refers to the flock, so the initial amount is ( x ). Then \\"plus the same amount\\" is another ( x ). Then \\"half of that amount\\" – is \\"that\\" referring to the same amount, which is ( x ), so half of ( x ) is ( frac{x}{2} ). Then \\"a quarter of that amount\\" – again, \\"that amount\\" is ( x ), so a quarter is ( frac{x}{4} ). Then plus the lone goose, which is 1. So, yes, the equation is correctly set up as ( x + x + frac{x}{2} + frac{x}{4} + 1 = 100 ).Another way to think about it is that the leader is describing a hypothetical flock that is the sum of the current flock, plus another flock of the same size, plus half of the current flock, plus a quarter of the current flock, plus the lone goose. So, that would be 2x + 0.5x + 0.25x + 1 = 100, which is the same as ( 2.75x + 1 = 100 ). Wait, 2x + 0.5x + 0.25x is 2.75x? Let me compute that:2x + 0.5x = 2.5x2.5x + 0.25x = 2.75xYes, so 2.75x + 1 = 100So, 2.75x = 99x = 99 / 2.75Calculating that: 99 divided by 2.75.Well, 2.75 is equal to 11/4, so dividing by 11/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/11.So, 99 * (4/11) = (99 / 11) * 4 = 9 * 4 = 36Yes, same result. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, if I didn't use algebra, I could think of it as the flock size multiplied by a factor, plus 1, equals 100. The factor is 2 + 0.5 + 0.25, which is 2.75. So, 2.75 times the flock size plus 1 is 100. So, subtract 1, get 99, divide by 2.75, get 36. So, all methods lead to 36. Therefore, the flock has 36 geese.Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. The leader says, \\"If there were as many of us as there are now, plus the same amount, plus half of that amount, plus a quarter of that amount, plus you, goose, then we would be a hundred geese.\\" So, \\"as many of us as there are now\\" is x. \\"Plus the same amount\\" is another x. \\"Plus half of that amount\\" – \\"that amount\\" refers to the same amount, which is x, so half of x. Then \\"plus a quarter of that amount\\" – again, \\"that amount\\" is x, so a quarter of x. Then plus the lone goose, which is 1. So, the equation is indeed x + x + 0.5x + 0.25x + 1 = 100.Alternatively, if someone misinterprets \\"that amount\\" as referring to the previous amount, like after adding the same amount, but that would be a different interpretation. Let me see.Suppose someone reads it as: starting with x, then adding x, then adding half of (x + x), then adding a quarter of (x + x + 0.5x). But that would be a different equation. Let me test that.If \\"that amount\\" refers to the cumulative amount after each addition, then:Start with x.Plus the same amount: x + x = 2x.Plus half of that amount: half of 2x is x, so 2x + x = 3x.Plus a quarter of that amount: a quarter of 3x is 0.75x, so 3x + 0.75x = 3.75x.Plus the lone goose: 3.75x + 1 = 100.Then, 3.75x = 99, so x = 99 / 3.75.Calculating that: 99 divided by 3.75.3.75 goes into 99 how many times? 3.75 * 26 = 97.5, so 26 times with a remainder of 1.5.1.5 / 3.75 = 0.4, so total x = 26.4. But that's not an integer, which is problematic because the number of geese should be a whole number.Therefore, this interpretation is likely incorrect because it leads to a fractional number of geese, which doesn't make sense in the context. So, the correct interpretation is that \\"that amount\\" refers to the original flock size, x, each time. Therefore, the equation is x + x + 0.5x + 0.25x + 1 = 100, leading to x = 36.Therefore, the flock has 36 geese.**Final Answer**The flock consists of boxed{36} geese."},{"question":"In triangle (ABC), angle (A) is (60^{circ}), and the angle bisector (AM), median (BN), and altitude (CL) intersect at one point. Find the other angles of the triangle.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: In triangle ABC, angle A is 60 degrees, and the angle bisector AM, median BN, and altitude CL intersect at one point. I need to find the other angles of the triangle. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to visualize this.First, let me recall some concepts. An angle bisector is a line that splits an angle into two equal parts. A median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. An altitude is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the opposite side. So, in this triangle, all three of these lines—AM, BN, and CL—are concurrent, meaning they meet at a single point.Since angle A is 60 degrees, that gives me some information about the triangle. I wonder if triangle ABC is equilateral? In an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees, and all medians, angle bisectors, and altitudes coincide. But in this case, the problem doesn't specify that the triangle is equilateral, just that angle A is 60 degrees. So, maybe it's not equilateral, but perhaps it's isosceles or something else.Let me denote the triangle ABC with angle A = 60°. Let me assign labels: let’s say point A is at the top, B is on the left, and C is on the right. So, AM is the angle bisector from A to side BC, BN is the median from B to the midpoint of AC, and CL is the altitude from C to side AB.Since all three lines intersect at one point, let's call this point P. So, P is the point where AM, BN, and CL meet.I think I can use Ceva's Theorem here. Ceva's Theorem states that for concurrent cevians (which are lines from a vertex to the opposite side) in a triangle, the product of certain ratios equals 1. Specifically, for cevians AM, BN, and CL, Ceva's Theorem tells us that:[frac{BM}{MC} cdot frac{CN}{NA} cdot frac{AL}{LB} = 1]But wait, in this case, AM is an angle bisector, BN is a median, and CL is an altitude. So, maybe I can express these ratios in terms of the sides of the triangle.Let me denote the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C as a, b, and c respectively. So, side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB.Since AM is the angle bisector of angle A, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, it divides side BC into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. That is:[frac{BM}{MC} = frac{AB}{AC} = frac{c}{b}]BN is a median, so it splits side AC into two equal parts. Therefore, CN = NA, which means:[frac{CN}{NA} = 1]CL is an altitude, so it is perpendicular to AB. Let me denote the foot of the altitude as L on AB. Since CL is an altitude, triangle CLB is a right-angled triangle. Maybe I can express AL and LB in terms of the sides.But wait, since CL is an altitude, we can write the area of triangle ABC in two ways: (1/2)*AB*CL and (1/2)*BC*height from A. But I don't know if that helps directly.Alternatively, since CL is an altitude, we can use trigonometric relationships. Let me denote angle at B as β and angle at C as γ. Since angle A is 60°, we have:[beta + gamma = 120°]So, if I can find either β or γ, I can find the other.Now, going back to Ceva's Theorem. Let me write down the ratios:[frac{BM}{MC} cdot frac{CN}{NA} cdot frac{AL}{LB} = 1]We already have:- (frac{BM}{MC} = frac{c}{b})- (frac{CN}{NA} = 1)So, we need to find (frac{AL}{LB}). Since CL is an altitude, maybe we can express AL and LB in terms of the sides and angles.Let me consider triangle CLB. It is right-angled at L, so:[CL = CB cdot sin beta][LB = CB cdot cos beta]Similarly, in triangle CLA, which is also right-angled at L:[CL = CA cdot sin gamma][AL = CA cdot cos gamma]Wait, but CL is the same in both, so:[CB cdot sin beta = CA cdot sin gamma]Which gives:[frac{CB}{CA} = frac{sin gamma}{sin beta}]But from the Law of Sines, we know that:[frac{CB}{CA} = frac{sin gamma}{sin beta}]Which is consistent. So, that doesn't give us new information.But let's go back to the ratio (frac{AL}{LB}). From the above, we have:[AL = CA cdot cos gamma][LB = CB cdot cos beta]So,[frac{AL}{LB} = frac{CA cdot cos gamma}{CB cdot cos beta}]But from the Law of Sines, we have:[frac{CA}{CB} = frac{sin beta}{sin gamma}]So, substituting that into the ratio:[frac{AL}{LB} = frac{sin beta}{sin gamma} cdot frac{cos gamma}{cos beta} = frac{sin beta cos gamma}{sin gamma cos beta}]Simplify this:[frac{AL}{LB} = frac{sin beta}{sin gamma} cdot frac{cos gamma}{cos beta} = frac{sin beta cos gamma}{sin gamma cos beta}]Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can express this in terms of tangent.[frac{AL}{LB} = frac{tan beta}{tan gamma}]Because:[frac{sin beta}{cos beta} = tan beta][frac{sin gamma}{cos gamma} = tan gamma]So, the ratio becomes:[frac{AL}{LB} = frac{tan beta}{tan gamma}]Okay, so now, going back to Ceva's Theorem:[frac{BM}{MC} cdot frac{CN}{NA} cdot frac{AL}{LB} = 1]Substituting the known ratios:[left( frac{c}{b} right) cdot 1 cdot left( frac{tan beta}{tan gamma} right) = 1]So,[frac{c}{b} cdot frac{tan beta}{tan gamma} = 1]But from the Law of Sines, we know that:[frac{c}{b} = frac{sin gamma}{sin beta}]Because:[frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}]Given angle A is 60°, so:[frac{c}{b} = frac{sin gamma}{sin beta}]Therefore, substituting back into our equation:[left( frac{sin gamma}{sin beta} right) cdot frac{tan beta}{tan gamma} = 1]Simplify this expression:First, note that (tan beta = frac{sin beta}{cos beta}) and (tan gamma = frac{sin gamma}{cos gamma}). So,[frac{sin gamma}{sin beta} cdot frac{sin beta / cos beta}{sin gamma / cos gamma} = 1]Simplify numerator and denominator:[frac{sin gamma}{sin beta} cdot frac{sin beta}{cos beta} cdot frac{cos gamma}{sin gamma} = 1]Cancel out terms:- (sin gamma) cancels with (sin gamma)- (sin beta) cancels with (sin beta)So, we're left with:[frac{cos gamma}{cos beta} = 1]Which implies:[cos gamma = cos beta]Therefore, either (gamma = beta) or (gamma = -beta). Since angles in a triangle are positive and less than 180°, we can disregard the negative solution, so:[gamma = beta]So, angles at B and C are equal. Therefore, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC.Wait, hold on. If angles B and C are equal, then sides opposite them are equal. So, side AC = side AB. So, AB = AC, meaning triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC.But angle A is 60°, so if it's isosceles with AB = AC and angle A = 60°, then it must be equilateral. Because in an isosceles triangle with vertex angle 60°, the base angles are also 60°, making all angles 60°, hence equilateral.But wait, the problem didn't specify that the triangle is equilateral, just that angle A is 60°, and the three cevians intersect at one point. So, does this necessarily mean the triangle is equilateral?Wait, let me think again. If angles B and C are equal, then sides AB and AC are equal. So, triangle is isosceles with AB = AC. Then, angle A is 60°, so the other two angles are (180 - 60)/2 = 60°, so all angles are 60°, hence equilateral.But wait, in that case, all medians, angle bisectors, and altitudes coincide, so they all meet at the centroid, which is also the incenter and orthocenter. So, in that case, yes, they concur at the same point.But is this the only possibility? Or is there another triangle where angle A is 60°, and the angle bisector, median, and altitude concur, but the triangle isn't equilateral?Wait, let's see. Suppose triangle ABC is not equilateral, but angle A is 60°, and the cevians AM, BN, CL concur. Then, from our earlier reasoning, we found that angles B and C must be equal, which would make the triangle equilateral. So, perhaps the only possibility is that the triangle is equilateral.But let me check if there's another way. Maybe I made a wrong assumption somewhere.Wait, let's go back. We had:From Ceva's Theorem:[frac{c}{b} cdot frac{tan beta}{tan gamma} = 1]And from the Law of Sines:[frac{c}{b} = frac{sin gamma}{sin beta}]So, substituting:[frac{sin gamma}{sin beta} cdot frac{tan beta}{tan gamma} = 1]Simplify:[frac{sin gamma}{sin beta} cdot frac{sin beta / cos beta}{sin gamma / cos gamma} = 1]Which simplifies to:[frac{cos gamma}{cos beta} = 1]So, (cos gamma = cos beta), which implies (gamma = beta) or (gamma = -beta). Since angles are positive, (gamma = beta). So, yes, angles B and C are equal.Therefore, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, and angle A = 60°, so it's equilateral.Wait, but in that case, all sides are equal, so all cevians coincide. So, the point of concurrency is the centroid, which is also the incenter, circumcenter, and orthocenter.But the problem didn't specify that the triangle is equilateral, just that angle A is 60°, and the three cevians concur. So, is the only possibility that the triangle is equilateral?Alternatively, maybe the triangle isn't equilateral, but the cevians still concur. Let me think.Suppose triangle ABC is not equilateral, but angle A is 60°, and the cevians AM, BN, CL concur. Then, from the above, we must have angles B and C equal, which would make it equilateral. So, perhaps the only possibility is that the triangle is equilateral.But let me test this with an example. Suppose triangle ABC is equilateral, then all cevians coincide, so they trivially concur. If it's not equilateral, but angle A is 60°, and the cevians concur, then it must be equilateral.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the application of Ceva's Theorem.Wait, let me double-check Ceva's Theorem. Ceva's Theorem states that for concurrent cevians, the product of the ratios is 1. The ratios are directed segments, but in this case, since all cevians are from different vertices, the ratios are positive.Wait, but in Ceva's Theorem, the ratios are of the divided sides. So, for cevians AM, BN, CL, the ratios are:- For AM: BM/MC- For BN: AN/NC- For CL: CL is an altitude, so it divides AB into AL and LB.Wait, but in Ceva's Theorem, the third ratio is usually the division on the third side. Wait, maybe I got the sides mixed up.Wait, Ceva's Theorem is about cevians from each vertex. So, in this case, AM is from A, BN is from B, and CL is from C. So, the sides they intersect are BC, AC, and AB respectively.So, the ratios are:- For AM: BM/MC- For BN: AN/NC- For CL: AL/LBSo, the product of these three ratios is 1.So, in our case, we have:- BM/MC = c/b (from Angle Bisector Theorem)- AN/NC = 1 (since BN is a median)- AL/LB = ?So, as before, we have:[frac{c}{b} cdot 1 cdot frac{AL}{LB} = 1]So, (frac{c}{b} cdot frac{AL}{LB} = 1)But earlier, we found that (frac{AL}{LB} = frac{tan beta}{tan gamma}), and from the Law of Sines, (frac{c}{b} = frac{sin gamma}{sin beta}), leading to:[frac{sin gamma}{sin beta} cdot frac{tan beta}{tan gamma} = 1]Which simplifies to (frac{cos gamma}{cos beta} = 1), so (gamma = beta). Therefore, triangle is isosceles with AB = AC, and since angle A is 60°, it's equilateral.So, perhaps the only possibility is that the triangle is equilateral, making all angles 60°. Therefore, the other angles are also 60°, so angles B and C are both 60°.But wait, let me think again. If the triangle is equilateral, then all cevians coincide, so they trivially concur. But is there a non-equilateral triangle with angle A = 60°, and the three cevians concur?Suppose triangle ABC is not equilateral, but angle A is 60°, and the cevians concur. Then, from the above, angles B and C must be equal, making it isosceles with AB = AC, and angle A = 60°, which would make it equilateral. So, perhaps the only possibility is equilateral.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that (frac{AL}{LB} = frac{tan beta}{tan gamma}). Let me re-examine that.Earlier, I considered triangles CLB and CLA, which are right-angled at L. So, in triangle CLB:[CL = CB cdot sin beta][LB = CB cdot cos beta]Similarly, in triangle CLA:[CL = CA cdot sin gamma][AL = CA cdot cos gamma]Therefore, since CL is the same in both:[CB cdot sin beta = CA cdot sin gamma]Which gives:[frac{CB}{CA} = frac{sin gamma}{sin beta}]Which is consistent with the Law of Sines.But for the ratio (frac{AL}{LB}), we have:[frac{AL}{LB} = frac{CA cdot cos gamma}{CB cdot cos beta}]But from the Law of Sines, (frac{CA}{CB} = frac{sin beta}{sin gamma}), so substituting:[frac{AL}{LB} = frac{sin beta}{sin gamma} cdot frac{cos gamma}{cos beta} = frac{sin beta cos gamma}{sin gamma cos beta}]Which is equal to:[frac{tan beta}{tan gamma}]So, that part seems correct.Therefore, the conclusion that (gamma = beta) seems unavoidable, leading to triangle ABC being equilateral.Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem using coordinate geometry. Let me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system.Let me place point A at (0, 0), and since angle A is 60°, I can place point B at (c, 0) and point C somewhere in the plane. But maybe it's better to use barycentric coordinates or something else.Alternatively, let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (b, 0), and point C at coordinates (d, e). Then, I can express the cevians AM, BN, and CL in terms of these coordinates and find the conditions for their concurrency.But this might be more complicated, but let's try.Let me denote:- Point A: (0, 0)- Point B: (c, 0)- Point C: (d, e)Given angle at A is 60°, so the angle between vectors AB and AC is 60°. The vectors AB and AC are (c, 0) and (d, e) respectively. The angle between them is 60°, so the dot product is:[AB cdot AC = |AB||AC| cos 60°]Which is:[c cdot d + 0 cdot e = |(c, 0)||(d, e)| cdot frac{1}{2}]So,[cd = frac{1}{2} sqrt{c^2} sqrt{d^2 + e^2}]Simplify:[cd = frac{1}{2} c sqrt{d^2 + e^2}]Divide both sides by c (assuming c ≠ 0):[d = frac{1}{2} sqrt{d^2 + e^2}]Square both sides:[d^2 = frac{1}{4}(d^2 + e^2)]Multiply both sides by 4:[4d^2 = d^2 + e^2]So,[3d^2 = e^2]Therefore,[e = sqrt{3} d]So, point C has coordinates (d, (sqrt{3} d)). So, the triangle is such that point C lies along the line y = (sqrt{3} x), which makes sense because angle at A is 60°, so the triangle is oriented such that AC makes a 60° angle with AB.Now, let's find the equations of the cevians AM, BN, and CL and find their point of intersection.First, let's find the coordinates of points M, N, and L.Point M is the point where the angle bisector from A meets BC. Since AM is the angle bisector, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, BM/MC = AB/AC.Compute AB and AC:- AB is the distance from A to B: (sqrt{(c - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = c)- AC is the distance from A to C: (sqrt{(d - 0)^2 + (sqrt{3} d - 0)^2} = sqrt{d^2 + 3d^2} = sqrt{4d^2} = 2d)Therefore, BM/MC = AB/AC = c/(2d)So, BM = (c/(2d + c)) * BCWait, no. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that BM/MC = AB/AC = c/(2d). So, BM = (c/(c + 2d)) * BCWait, let me denote BC as the length between points B (c, 0) and C (d, (sqrt{3} d)).Compute BC:[BC = sqrt{(d - c)^2 + (sqrt{3} d - 0)^2} = sqrt{(d - c)^2 + 3d^2}]But maybe instead of computing lengths, it's better to find the coordinates of M.Since BM/MC = c/(2d), the coordinates of M can be found using the section formula. If a point divides a line segment in the ratio m:n, then the coordinates are:[left( frac{m x_2 + n x_1}{m + n}, frac{m y_2 + n y_1}{m + n} right)]Here, point M divides BC in the ratio BM:MC = c : 2d. So, m = c, n = 2d.Coordinates of B: (c, 0)Coordinates of C: (d, (sqrt{3} d))Therefore, coordinates of M:[x = frac{c cdot d + 2d cdot c}{c + 2d} = frac{cd + 2cd}{c + 2d} = frac{3cd}{c + 2d}][y = frac{c cdot sqrt{3} d + 2d cdot 0}{c + 2d} = frac{c sqrt{3} d}{c + 2d}]So, M is at (left( frac{3cd}{c + 2d}, frac{c sqrt{3} d}{c + 2d} right))Next, point N is the midpoint of AC since BN is a median. Coordinates of A: (0, 0), coordinates of C: (d, (sqrt{3} d)). So, midpoint N is:[x = frac{0 + d}{2} = frac{d}{2}][y = frac{0 + sqrt{3} d}{2} = frac{sqrt{3} d}{2}]So, N is at (left( frac{d}{2}, frac{sqrt{3} d}{2} right))Point L is the foot of the altitude from C to AB. Since AB is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (c, 0), the altitude from C is vertical if AB is horizontal. Wait, no, the altitude from C to AB is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is horizontal, the altitude is vertical. So, the foot L has the same x-coordinate as C, but y-coordinate 0. Wait, no, that's only if AB is horizontal and the altitude is vertical, but in this case, AB is along the x-axis, so the altitude from C is vertical? Wait, no, the altitude from C to AB would be a vertical line only if AB is horizontal and C is directly above AB. But in our case, point C is at (d, (sqrt{3} d)), so the altitude from C to AB is a vertical line if AB is horizontal. Wait, no, the altitude is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is along the x-axis, its slope is 0, so the altitude from C is vertical, i.e., has an undefined slope. Therefore, the foot L is directly below C on AB, so L has coordinates (d, 0). But wait, AB is from (0,0) to (c, 0). So, if d is between 0 and c, then L is at (d, 0). If d is outside that range, L would be at one of the endpoints, but since C is a vertex of the triangle, d must be between 0 and c, right? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because in our coordinate system, point C is at (d, (sqrt{3} d)), but depending on the value of d, it can be to the left or right of AB.Wait, but in our earlier calculation, we found that e = (sqrt{3} d), so point C is somewhere in the plane such that AC makes a 60° angle with AB. So, if AB is from (0,0) to (c, 0), then point C can be either above or below AB, but in our case, since we're dealing with a triangle, it's above AB.But regardless, the foot of the altitude from C to AB is at (d, 0). So, point L is at (d, 0).Now, we have the coordinates of points M, N, and L.Now, let's find the equations of the cevians AM, BN, and CL.First, cevian AM: from A(0,0) to M(left( frac{3cd}{c + 2d}, frac{c sqrt{3} d}{c + 2d} right)). The parametric equation of AM can be written as:[x = t cdot frac{3cd}{c + 2d}, quad y = t cdot frac{c sqrt{3} d}{c + 2d}, quad t in [0, 1]]Alternatively, the slope of AM is:[m_{AM} = frac{frac{c sqrt{3} d}{c + 2d} - 0}{frac{3cd}{c + 2d} - 0} = frac{c sqrt{3} d}{3cd} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}]So, the equation of AM is:[y = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} x]Second, cevian BN: from B(c, 0) to N(left( frac{d}{2}, frac{sqrt{3} d}{2} right)). Let's find the slope:[m_{BN} = frac{frac{sqrt{3} d}{2} - 0}{frac{d}{2} - c} = frac{sqrt{3} d / 2}{(d - 2c)/2} = frac{sqrt{3} d}{d - 2c}]So, the equation of BN is:[y - 0 = frac{sqrt{3} d}{d - 2c} (x - c)][y = frac{sqrt{3} d}{d - 2c} (x - c)]Third, cevian CL: from C(d, (sqrt{3} d)) to L(d, 0). Since both points have the same x-coordinate, this is a vertical line at x = d.So, the equation of CL is x = d.Now, we need to find the point of intersection P of AM, BN, and CL.Since CL is x = d, let's find the intersection of AM and CL.From AM: y = (√3 / 3) x. At x = d, y = (√3 / 3) d.So, point P is at (d, (√3 / 3) d).Now, let's check if this point lies on BN.Substitute x = d, y = (√3 / 3) d into the equation of BN:[frac{sqrt{3}}{3} d = frac{sqrt{3} d}{d - 2c} (d - c)]Simplify:Multiply both sides by (d - 2c):[frac{sqrt{3}}{3} d (d - 2c) = sqrt{3} d (d - c)]Divide both sides by √3 d (assuming d ≠ 0):[frac{1}{3} (d - 2c) = (d - c)]Multiply both sides by 3:[d - 2c = 3d - 3c]Bring all terms to one side:[d - 2c - 3d + 3c = 0][-2d + c = 0][c = 2d]So, we have c = 2d.Therefore, in our coordinate system, c = 2d.So, from earlier, point C is at (d, √3 d), and point B is at (2d, 0).So, let's compute the sides:- AB: from (0,0) to (2d, 0): length is 2d- AC: from (0,0) to (d, √3 d): length is √(d² + 3d²) = √(4d²) = 2d- BC: from (2d, 0) to (d, √3 d): length is √[(d - 2d)² + (√3 d - 0)²] = √[d² + 3d²] = √(4d²) = 2dSo, all sides are equal: AB = AC = BC = 2d. Therefore, triangle ABC is equilateral.Therefore, all angles are 60°, so angles B and C are both 60°.Therefore, the other angles are 60° each.So, the conclusion is that triangle ABC is equilateral, so angles B and C are both 60°.**Final Answer**The other angles of the triangle are both boxed{60^circ}."},{"question":"For each three-digit number, calculate the sum of its digits.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that a fraction is in its simplest form if the numerator and the denominator have no common factors other than 1. So, if ( frac{3n + 2}{5n + 1} ) is not in simplest form, that means the greatest common divisor (GCD) of ( 3n + 2 ) and ( 5n + 1 ) is greater than 1. So, I need to find all three-digit numbers ( n ) where ( gcd(3n + 2, 5n + 1) > 1 ).Alright, so how do I find the GCD of two numbers? I remember the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me write down the two expressions:Let ( a = 3n + 2 ) and ( b = 5n + 1 ). Then, ( gcd(a, b) ) is the same as ( gcd(b, a mod b) ). Let me compute ( a mod b ).Wait, actually, since ( a ) and ( b ) are linear in ( n ), maybe I can find a relationship between them. Let me subtract multiples of one from the other to simplify.So, ( gcd(3n + 2, 5n + 1) ). Let me subtract 1 times ( (3n + 2) ) from ( (5n + 1) ). That would give:( 5n + 1 - 1*(3n + 2) = 2n - 1 ).So, now, ( gcd(3n + 2, 5n + 1) = gcd(3n + 2, 2n - 1) ).Hmm, okay, so now I have ( gcd(3n + 2, 2n - 1) ). Let me continue this process. Let me subtract 1 times ( (2n - 1) ) from ( (3n + 2) ):( 3n + 2 - 1*(2n - 1) = n + 3 ).So now, ( gcd(3n + 2, 2n - 1) = gcd(2n - 1, n + 3) ).Continuing, subtract 2 times ( (n + 3) ) from ( (2n - 1) ):( 2n - 1 - 2*(n + 3) = 2n - 1 - 2n - 6 = -7 ).So, ( gcd(2n - 1, n + 3) = gcd(n + 3, -7) ). But since GCD is always positive, this is equal to ( gcd(n + 3, 7) ).Therefore, ( gcd(3n + 2, 5n + 1) = gcd(n + 3, 7) ).So, this GCD is greater than 1 if and only if 7 divides ( n + 3 ). Because 7 is a prime number, so the only divisors are 1 and 7. Therefore, ( gcd(n + 3, 7) > 1 ) implies that 7 divides ( n + 3 ).Therefore, ( n + 3 ) must be a multiple of 7. So, ( n + 3 = 7k ) for some integer ( k ). Hence, ( n = 7k - 3 ).But ( n ) is a three-digit number, so ( 100 leq n leq 999 ). Therefore, substituting ( n = 7k - 3 ), we have:( 100 leq 7k - 3 leq 999 ).Let me solve for ( k ):Add 3 to all sides:( 103 leq 7k leq 1002 ).Divide all sides by 7:( frac{103}{7} leq k leq frac{1002}{7} ).Calculating:( 103 ÷ 7 ) is approximately 14.714, so since ( k ) must be an integer, the smallest ( k ) is 15.Similarly, ( 1002 ÷ 7 ) is approximately 143.142, so the largest integer ( k ) is 143.Therefore, ( k ) ranges from 15 to 143 inclusive.Now, the number of terms in this sequence is ( 143 - 15 + 1 = 129 ). So, there are 129 such numbers ( n ).But I need to find the sum of all such ( n ). Since ( n = 7k - 3 ), the sum is the sum over ( k = 15 ) to ( k = 143 ) of ( 7k - 3 ).Let me write that as:Sum = ( sum_{k=15}^{143} (7k - 3) ).This can be split into two sums:Sum = ( 7 sum_{k=15}^{143} k - 3 sum_{k=15}^{143} 1 ).Compute each part separately.First, compute ( sum_{k=15}^{143} k ). The sum of consecutive integers from ( a ) to ( b ) is ( frac{(a + b)(b - a + 1)}{2} ).So, ( a = 15 ), ( b = 143 ). Therefore, the number of terms is ( 143 - 15 + 1 = 129 ).Sum = ( frac{(15 + 143) * 129}{2} ).Compute ( 15 + 143 = 158 ).So, ( frac{158 * 129}{2} ).Compute 158 / 2 = 79, so 79 * 129.Compute 79 * 100 = 7900, 79 * 29 = 2291. So, 7900 + 2291 = 10191.So, ( sum_{k=15}^{143} k = 10191 ).Next, compute ( sum_{k=15}^{143} 1 ). That's just the number of terms, which is 129.Therefore, the total sum is:7 * 10191 - 3 * 129.Compute 7 * 10191:10191 * 7: Let's compute 10000 * 7 = 70000, 191 * 7 = 1337. So, 70000 + 1337 = 71337.Then, 3 * 129 = 387.So, total sum = 71337 - 387 = 70950.Wait, let me verify that subtraction:71337 - 387:71337 - 300 = 7103771037 - 87 = 70950.Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the sum of all such three-digit numbers ( n ) is 70,950.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap:1. We started with ( gcd(3n + 2, 5n + 1) ).2. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we reduced it to ( gcd(n + 3, 7) ).3. Therefore, ( n + 3 ) must be a multiple of 7, so ( n = 7k - 3 ).4. ( n ) is a three-digit number, so ( 100 leq 7k - 3 leq 999 ).5. Solving for ( k ), we found ( k ) from 15 to 143, inclusive, which gives 129 numbers.6. Summing ( n = 7k - 3 ) over these ( k ) gives 70,950.Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me double-check the sum:Sum = 7 * sum(k from 15 to 143) - 3 * 129.Sum(k from 15 to 143) = 10191, as calculated.7 * 10191: 10191 * 7:10191 * 7:10000 * 7 = 70000191 * 7 = 133770000 + 1337 = 71337. Correct.3 * 129 = 387. Correct.71337 - 387 = 70950. Correct.Yes, that seems right.Therefore, the answer is 70,950.**Final Answer**The sum of all such three-digit numbers ( n ) is boxed{70950}."},{"question":"The opposite number of -6 is __________.","answer":"To find the opposite number of -6, I need to determine the number that is the same distance from zero on the number line but in the opposite direction.Since -6 is located 6 units to the left of zero, its opposite number will be 6 units to the right of zero.Therefore, the opposite number of -6 is 6."},{"question":"In a batch of 12 parts, there are 8 standard parts. Find the probability that among 5 randomly selected parts, there will be 3 standard parts.","answer":"Alright, so I have this probability problem here: In a batch of 12 parts, there are 8 standard parts. I need to find the probability that among 5 randomly selected parts, there will be 3 standard parts. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that probability problems often involve combinations because the order in which we select items doesn't matter. So, if I'm selecting parts from a batch, the number of ways to choose a certain number of parts is a combination problem. Let me recall the formula for combinations. The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items is given by the combination formula:[C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}]Where \\"!\\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. So, for example, 5! is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.Okay, so in this problem, there are 12 parts in total, and 8 of them are standard. I need to find the probability that when I randomly select 5 parts, exactly 3 of them are standard. I think this is a hypergeometric probability problem because we're dealing with two groups: standard parts and non-standard parts. The hypergeometric distribution is used when we're sampling without replacement from a finite population that has two distinct categories.The formula for the hypergeometric probability is:[P(X = k) = frac{C(K, k) times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}]Where:- ( N ) is the total population size (12 parts)- ( K ) is the number of success states in the population (8 standard parts)- ( n ) is the number of draws (5 parts selected)- ( k ) is the number of observed successes (3 standard parts)So, plugging in the numbers:- ( N = 12 )- ( K = 8 )- ( n = 5 )- ( k = 3 )Let me compute each part step by step.First, calculate ( C(8, 3) ). That's the number of ways to choose 3 standard parts from 8.[C(8, 3) = frac{8!}{3!(8 - 3)!} = frac{8!}{3!5!}]Calculating the factorials:- 8! = 40320- 3! = 6- 5! = 120So,[C(8, 3) = frac{40320}{6 times 120} = frac{40320}{720} = 56]Okay, so there are 56 ways to choose 3 standard parts.Next, I need to calculate ( C(12 - 8, 5 - 3) ), which is ( C(4, 2) ). That's the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 parts from the non-standard ones.[C(4, 2) = frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = frac{4!}{2!2!}]Calculating the factorials:- 4! = 24- 2! = 2So,[C(4, 2) = frac{24}{2 times 2} = frac{24}{4} = 6]Alright, so there are 6 ways to choose 2 non-standard parts.Now, multiply these two results together to get the number of favorable outcomes:[56 times 6 = 336]So, there are 336 favorable ways to choose 3 standard and 2 non-standard parts.Now, I need to find the total number of ways to choose any 5 parts from the 12. That's ( C(12, 5) ).[C(12, 5) = frac{12!}{5!(12 - 5)!} = frac{12!}{5!7!}]Calculating the factorials:- 12! = 479001600- 5! = 120- 7! = 5040So,[C(12, 5) = frac{479001600}{120 times 5040} = frac{479001600}{604800}]Let me compute that division:Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 4790016 / 6048Wait, maybe it's easier to simplify before multiplying.Alternatively, I can compute 12! / (5!7!) as:12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)Because 12! / 7! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7! / 7! = 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8So,[C(12, 5) = frac{12 times 11 times 10 times 9 times 8}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1}]Compute numerator: 12 × 11 = 132; 132 × 10 = 1320; 1320 × 9 = 11880; 11880 × 8 = 95040Denominator: 5 × 4 = 20; 20 × 3 = 60; 60 × 2 = 120; 120 × 1 = 120So,[C(12, 5) = frac{95040}{120} = 792]So, there are 792 total ways to choose any 5 parts from 12.Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:[P = frac{336}{792}]Simplify this fraction. Let's see if both numbers are divisible by 24.336 ÷ 24 = 14792 ÷ 24 = 33So, 336/792 simplifies to 14/33.Wait, let me check that division:24 × 14 = 33624 × 33 = 792Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, I can divide numerator and denominator by 12 first:336 ÷ 12 = 28792 ÷ 12 = 66So, 28/66. Then divide numerator and denominator by 2:28 ÷ 2 = 1466 ÷ 2 = 33Same result: 14/33.So, the probability is 14/33.Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, C(8,3) = 56, that's correct.C(4,2) = 6, that's correct.56 × 6 = 336, that's correct.C(12,5) = 792, that's correct.336/792 simplifies to 14/33, yes.So, the probability is 14/33.Alternatively, as a decimal, that's approximately 0.4242, or 42.42%.But since the question doesn't specify the form, and since 14/33 is a reduced fraction, I think that's the appropriate answer.Wait, just to make sure, let me think about another way to approach this problem.Alternatively, I can think of it as the probability of choosing 3 standard and 2 non-standard parts in any order.So, the probability would be:(Number of ways to choose 3 standard parts) × (Number of ways to choose 2 non-standard parts) divided by (Total number of ways to choose 5 parts).Which is exactly what I did earlier.So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, I can think of it as:Probability = (8/12) × (7/11) × (6/10) × (4/9) × (3/8) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange these successes and failures.Wait, that might be another approach, using permutations instead of combinations.But that would be more complicated because I have to consider the different orders.But let me try that approach just to confirm.So, the probability of choosing 3 standard parts and 2 non-standard parts can be calculated by considering the different sequences in which this can happen.For example, the first three parts could be standard and the last two non-standard, or the first two standard, then a non-standard, then a standard, then a non-standard, etc.Each of these sequences has the same probability, so the total probability is the number of such sequences multiplied by the probability of each sequence.The number of sequences is the number of ways to arrange 3 standard and 2 non-standard parts in 5 selections, which is C(5,3) = 10.Each sequence has a probability of (8/12) × (7/11) × (6/10) × (4/9) × (3/8).Wait, let's compute that.First, the probability for one specific sequence where the first three are standard and the last two are non-standard:(8/12) × (7/11) × (6/10) × (4/9) × (3/8)Simplify each term:8/12 = 2/37/11 remains 7/116/10 = 3/54/9 remains 4/93/8 remains 3/8Multiply them together:(2/3) × (7/11) × (3/5) × (4/9) × (3/8)Let me compute step by step:First, 2/3 × 7/11 = (2×7)/(3×11) = 14/33Then, 14/33 × 3/5 = (14×3)/(33×5) = 42/165Simplify 42/165: both divisible by 3, so 14/55.Next, 14/55 × 4/9 = (14×4)/(55×9) = 56/495Then, 56/495 × 3/8 = (56×3)/(495×8) = 168/3960Simplify 168/3960: divide numerator and denominator by 12: 14/330, which simplifies to 7/165.Wait, that seems different from before.Wait, but hold on, that's just one specific sequence. Since there are C(5,3) = 10 sequences, each with the same probability, the total probability is 10 × (7/165) = 70/165.Simplify 70/165: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 14/33.Ah, so same result as before.So, that confirms that the probability is indeed 14/33.Therefore, I can be confident that 14/33 is the correct probability.Just to recap, the two methods I used both led me to the same answer:1. Using combinations: (C(8,3) × C(4,2)) / C(12,5) = 336/792 = 14/33.2. Using permutations and considering all possible sequences: 10 × (probability of one specific sequence) = 10 × (7/165) = 70/165 = 14/33.Both methods give the same result, so I think that's solid.I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recheck the combination calculations.C(8,3):8! / (3!5!) = (8×7×6×5!)/(3×2×1×5!) = (8×7×6)/6 = (8×7) = 56. Correct.C(4,2):4! / (2!2!) = (4×3×2!)/(2×1×2!) = (4×3)/4 = 3. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 4×3 is 12, divided by 2×2 is 4, so 12/4=3? Wait, no, 4×3=12, divided by 2×2=4, so 12/4=3? Wait, that can't be because earlier I got 6.Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here.Wait, 4! is 24, 2! is 2, so 24/(2×2) = 24/4 = 6. So, C(4,2)=6. So, my initial calculation was correct.Wait, in my recap above, I thought of 4×3 divided by 2×2, which is 12/4=3, but that's incorrect because 4! is 24, not 12.Wait, no, actually, the formula is n! / (k!(n - k)!), so 4! / (2!2!) = 24 / (2×2) = 24/4 = 6. So, correct.So, C(4,2)=6.So, 56 × 6 = 336.C(12,5)=792.336/792=14/33.Yes, that's correct.So, no mistake there.In the permutation approach, I considered one specific sequence and multiplied by the number of sequences, which gave me the same result.Therefore, I think I'm confident that 14/33 is the correct probability.Just to think about whether that makes sense.Given that 8 out of 12 are standard, which is 2/3. So, if I pick 5 parts, expecting about 2/3 of them to be standard, which would be around 3.33. So, 3 standard parts is slightly below the expected value, but not too far off. So, a probability of about 14/33, which is roughly 0.424, seems reasonable.If I had, say, 4 standard parts, the probability might be higher, and 2 standard parts might be lower. So, 3 is in the middle, so 42% seems plausible.Alternatively, if I had 5 standard parts, the probability would be lower, and 1 standard part would be even lower.So, 14/33 is about 42%, which seems reasonable.Therefore, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.**Final Answer**The probability is boxed{dfrac{14}{33}}."},{"question":"Let star (x) be the sum of the digits of a positive integer x. mathcal{S} is the set of positive integers such that for all elements n in mathcal{S}, we have that star (n)=12 and 0le n< 10^{7}. If m is the number of elements in mathcal{S}, compute star(m).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of positive integers n such that the sum of their digits is 12, and n is less than 10^7. Then, once I find that number, which is m, I need to compute the sum of its digits, which is denoted as star(m). First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We're dealing with numbers n where each digit adds up to 12, and n is a 7-digit number or less. Since n is a positive integer, it can have up to 7 digits, right? Because 10^7 is 10,000,000, which is an 8-digit number, so n must be less than that, meaning it can have at most 7 digits. So, essentially, I need to count how many 7-digit numbers (including those with leading zeros, because numbers like 0000001 are technically 7-digit if we consider leading zeros, but since n is a positive integer, maybe leading zeros aren't counted? Hmm, wait, actually, in the context of digit sums, leading zeros don't affect the sum because they contribute 0. So maybe it's better to think of all numbers from 0000000 to 9999999, which are 7-digit numbers with leading zeros allowed, and count how many of these have a digit sum of 12. Then, since n is a positive integer, we have to subtract 1 if 0000000 is included, but 0000000 isn't a positive integer, so maybe it's okay. Wait, actually, n is a positive integer, so n can be from 1 to 9999999. So, numbers from 1 to 9999999. So, in terms of digit counts, they can have 1 to 7 digits. So, when considering digit sums, leading zeros don't contribute to the digit sum, so maybe it's equivalent to counting the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 12, where each di is between 0 and 9 inclusive. Because each digit can be from 0 to 9, and the sum is 12. But wait, if we include leading zeros, then numbers like 0000001 are considered, but since n is a positive integer, 0000001 is just 1, which is a 1-digit number. So, maybe the count is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 12, with each di ≤ 9. Yes, that seems right. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 = 12,where each di is between 0 and 9 inclusive. So, in combinatorics, this is a classic stars and bars problem with restrictions. Without restrictions, the number of solutions would be C(12 + 7 - 1, 7 - 1) = C(18, 6). But since each digit can be at most 9, we have to subtract the cases where one or more digits exceed 9. So, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the formula for the number of solutions is:C(18, 6) - C(7, 1)*C(18 - 10, 6) + C(7, 2)*C(18 - 20, 6) - ... But wait, let's think about it step by step. First, the total number of non-negative integer solutions without any restrictions is C(12 + 7 - 1, 7 - 1) = C(18, 6). Now, we need to subtract the cases where at least one digit is greater than 9. Let's denote by A_i the set of solutions where digit i is greater than 9. Then, the number of solutions where at least one digit exceeds 9 is |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ A7|. By the inclusion-exclusion principle, this is equal to:Σ|A_i| - Σ|A_i ∩ A_j| + Σ|A_i ∩ A_j ∩ A_k| - ... + (-1)^{k+1} Σ|A_{i1} ∩ ... ∩ A_{ik}|} + ... So, first, let's compute |A_i|. For a single digit exceeding 9, say d1 ≥ 10, we can set d1' = d1 - 10, so d1' ≥ 0. Then, the equation becomes d1' + d2 + ... + d7 = 12 - 10 = 2. The number of solutions is C(2 + 7 - 1, 7 - 1) = C(8, 6) = 28. Since there are 7 digits, the total number of such cases is 7 * 28 = 196.Next, we need to compute |A_i ∩ A_j|, which is the number of solutions where two digits are each at least 10. So, for two digits, say d1 and d2, we set d1' = d1 - 10 and d2' = d2 - 10. Then, the equation becomes d1' + d2' + d3 + ... + d7 = 12 - 20 = -8. Wait, that's negative, which means there are no solutions in this case. So, |A_i ∩ A_j| = 0 for all i ≠ j. Therefore, higher-order intersections (three or more digits exceeding 9) will also result in negative sums, which are impossible, so they contribute 0. Hence, by inclusion-exclusion, the total number of solutions is:C(18, 6) - 7*C(8, 6) + 0 - 0 + ... So, let's compute these values.First, C(18, 6). Let me calculate that:C(18, 6) = 18! / (6! * 12!) = (18*17*16*15*14*13)/(6*5*4*3*2*1) Let me compute numerator: 18*17=306, 306*16=4896, 4896*15=73440, 73440*14=1028160, 1028160*13=13365680.Denominator: 6*5=30, 30*4=120, 120*3=360, 360*2=720, 720*1=720.So, 13365680 / 720. Let me compute that.Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 1336568 / 72.1336568 ÷ 72. Let's see:72*18560 = 72*(18000 + 560) = 72*18000=1,296,000; 72*560=40,320. So total 1,296,000 + 40,320 = 1,336,320.Subtract from numerator: 1,336,568 - 1,336,320 = 248.So, 248 / 72 = 3.444... So, total is 18560 + 3.444... = 18563.444... Wait, that can't be right because C(18,6) is a whole number.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.Wait, 18*17=306, 306*16=4896, 4896*15=73440, 73440*14=1,028,160, 1,028,160*13=13,365, 13,365*1000=13,365,000? Wait, no, 1,028,160*13 is 13,365, 13,365*1000=13,365,000? Wait, no, 1,028,160 *10=10,281,600, plus 1,028,160*3=3,084,480, so total 13,366,080.Wait, so numerator is 13,366,080.Denominator is 720.So, 13,366,080 / 720.Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 1,336,608 / 72.Compute 1,336,608 ÷ 72.72*18,000=1,296,000.Subtract: 1,336,608 - 1,296,000 = 40,608.72*564=40,608.So, total is 18,000 + 564 = 18,564.So, C(18,6)=18,564.Okay, that's correct.Now, C(8,6). Let's compute that.C(8,6)=C(8,2)=28. Because C(n,k)=C(n,n−k). So, 8*7/2=28.So, 7*C(8,6)=7*28=196.Therefore, the total number of solutions is 18,564 - 196 = 18,368.Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.Total solutions without restriction: 18,564.Subtract the cases where any digit is ≥10: 7*28=196.So, 18,564 - 196 = 18,368.So, the number of 7-digit numbers (with leading zeros allowed) where the sum of digits is 12 is 18,368.But wait, hold on. The problem says n is a positive integer, so n can be from 1 to 9,999,999. So, does that include numbers with fewer digits? For example, numbers like 12 (which is a 2-digit number) are included in this count because when we consider leading zeros, they are represented as 0000012, which is a 7-digit number with digit sum 1+2=3, but in our case, the digit sum is 12. Wait, actually, the count we did includes all numbers from 0000000 to 9999999, which are 7-digit numbers with leading zeros. But n is a positive integer, so n cannot be 0000000. However, in our count, the digit sum is 12, so 0000000 isn't included because its digit sum is 0. So, our count of 18,368 includes all numbers from 0000001 to 9999999 with digit sum 12. But since n is a positive integer, 0000001 is just 1, which is a positive integer. So, actually, the count is correct because all numbers counted are positive integers, just represented with leading zeros to make them 7-digit numbers. Therefore, the number of elements in set S is 18,368. So, m=18,368.Now, we need to compute star(m), which is the sum of the digits of m.So, m=18,368.Let's compute the sum of its digits.1 + 8 + 3 + 6 + 8.Compute step by step:1 + 8 = 9.9 + 3 = 12.12 + 6 = 18.18 + 8 = 26.So, the sum of the digits of m is 26.Wait, is that correct?Let me write it out:18,368.Digits: 1, 8, 3, 6, 8.Sum: 1 + 8 = 9; 9 + 3 = 12; 12 + 6 = 18; 18 + 8 = 26.Yes, that seems correct.So, star(m)=26.Therefore, the answer is 26.But before I conclude, let me just make sure that my initial count was correct. So, the number of non-negative integer solutions to d1 + d2 + ... + d7 =12, with each di ≤9 is 18,368.Wait, is there another way to compute this? Maybe using generating functions?The generating function for each digit is (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^9). So, for 7 digits, it's (1 + x + ... +x^9)^7. We need the coefficient of x^12 in this expansion.Alternatively, we can write it as (1 - x^{10})^7 / (1 - x)^7.So, the coefficient of x^12 is C(12 +7 -1, 7 -1) - C(7,1)*C(12 -10 +7 -1, 7 -1). Wait, that's exactly what we did earlier.So, C(18,6) - 7*C(8,6) = 18,564 - 196 = 18,368.So, that confirms the count is correct.Therefore, m=18,368, and star(m)=26.**Final Answer**boxed{26}"},{"question":"Let the set[ S={1, 2, cdots, 12}, quad A={a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}} ]where ( a_{1} < a_{2} < a_{3}, quad a_{3} - a_{2} leq 5, quad A subseteq S ).

The conditions are that ( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 ) and ( a_3 - a_2 leq 5 ). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this.First, I know that without any restrictions, the number of 3-element subsets of S is just ( binom{12}{3} ). Let me calculate that real quick: ( binom{12}{3} = frac{12 times 11 times 10}{3 times 2 times 1} = 220 ). So, there are 220 possible sets A if we don't consider the restriction ( a_3 - a_2 leq 5 ).But we do have this restriction, so I need to subtract the number of sets where ( a_3 - a_2 > 5 ) from the total. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of valid sets directly. Hmm, not sure which approach is better yet.Let me think about the restriction ( a_3 - a_2 leq 5 ). So, for any set A, the difference between the largest and the middle element must be at most 5. That means ( a_3 ) can be at most ( a_2 + 5 ). So, if I fix ( a_2 ), then ( a_3 ) can be from ( a_2 + 1 ) up to ( a_2 + 5 ), but also, ( a_3 ) can't exceed 12. Similarly, ( a_1 ) can be any number less than ( a_2 ).Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a problem of choosing ( a_1, a_2, a_3 ) such that ( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 ) and ( a_3 - a_2 leq 5 ). So, perhaps I can fix ( a_2 ) and ( a_3 ) first, ensuring their difference is at most 5, and then count the number of possible ( a_1 ) for each such pair.Yes, that sounds like a plan. So, let's fix ( a_2 ) and ( a_3 ) such that ( a_3 - a_2 leq 5 ). Then, for each such pair, the number of possible ( a_1 ) is ( a_2 - 1 ), since ( a_1 ) has to be less than ( a_2 ).So, the total number of sets A would be the sum over all valid ( a_2 ) and ( a_3 ) of ( (a_2 - 1) ).Therefore, I need to find all pairs ( (a_2, a_3) ) where ( a_3 ) is between ( a_2 + 1 ) and ( a_2 + 5 ), and ( a_3 leq 12 ). Then, for each such pair, add ( a_2 - 1 ) to the total.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as for each ( a_3 ), determine how many ( a_2 ) satisfy ( a_3 - 5 leq a_2 < a_3 ), and then for each such ( a_2 ), the number of ( a_1 ) is ( a_2 - 1 ).Wait, perhaps it's better to fix ( a_2 ) first. Let me try that.Let me consider ( a_2 ) ranging from 2 to 11 (since ( a_1 ) has to be at least 1, and ( a_3 ) has to be at least ( a_2 + 1 )). For each ( a_2 ), ( a_3 ) can be from ( a_2 + 1 ) to ( min(a_2 + 5, 12) ). So, the number of possible ( a_3 ) for each ( a_2 ) is ( min(a_2 + 5, 12) - a_2 ).Let me compute that:- For ( a_2 = 2 ): ( a_3 ) can be 3,4,5,6,7 (since 2 + 5 =7). So, 5 options.- For ( a_2 = 3 ): ( a_3 ) can be 4,5,6,7,8. 5 options.- Similarly, for ( a_2 = 4 ): 5 options (5,6,7,8,9)- ( a_2 = 5 ): 5 options (6,7,8,9,10)- ( a_2 = 6 ): 5 options (7,8,9,10,11)- ( a_2 = 7 ): 5 options (8,9,10,11,12)- ( a_2 = 8 ): ( a_3 ) can be 9,10,11,12. So, 4 options.- ( a_2 = 9 ): ( a_3 ) can be 10,11,12. 3 options.- ( a_2 = 10 ): ( a_3 ) can be 11,12. 2 options.- ( a_2 = 11 ): ( a_3 ) can be 12. 1 option.So, for ( a_2 ) from 2 to 7, we have 5 options each, and then decreasing from 8 onwards.So, the number of ( a_3 ) for each ( a_2 ) is:- ( a_2 = 2 ): 5- ( a_2 = 3 ): 5- ( a_2 = 4 ): 5- ( a_2 = 5 ): 5- ( a_2 = 6 ): 5- ( a_2 = 7 ): 5- ( a_2 = 8 ): 4- ( a_2 = 9 ): 3- ( a_2 = 10 ): 2- ( a_2 = 11 ): 1So, the total number of ( (a_2, a_3) ) pairs is ( 6 times 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 ). Let me compute that: 6*5=30, 4+3+2+1=10, so total 40.Wait, but is that correct? Let me recount:From ( a_2 = 2 ) to ( a_2 =7 ), that's 6 values, each contributing 5, so 30.Then, ( a_2 =8 ):4, ( a_2=9 ):3, ( a_2=10 ):2, ( a_2=11 ):1. So, 4+3+2+1=10. So, total 30+10=40. So, 40 pairs.But wait, each pair ( (a_2, a_3) ) corresponds to a certain number of sets A, depending on how many ( a_1 ) can be chosen. Since ( a_1 ) must be less than ( a_2 ), the number of choices for ( a_1 ) is ( a_2 -1 ).Therefore, for each ( a_2 ), the number of sets A is ( (a_2 -1) times ) (number of ( a_3 ) for that ( a_2 )).So, let me compute this:For each ( a_2 ):- ( a_2 =2 ): ( (2-1) times 5 =1 times5=5 )- ( a_2 =3 ): ( (3-1) times5=2times5=10 )- ( a_2 =4 ): (3 times5=15)- ( a_2 =5 ): (4 times5=20)- ( a_2 =6 ): (5 times5=25)- ( a_2 =7 ): (6 times5=30)- ( a_2 =8 ): (7 times4=28)- ( a_2 =9 ): (8 times3=24)- ( a_2 =10 ): (9 times2=18)- ( a_2 =11 ): (10 times1=10)Now, let me sum all these up:Starting from ( a_2=2 ):5 (a2=2) +10 (a2=3)=15+15 (a2=4)=30+20 (a2=5)=50+25 (a2=6)=75+30 (a2=7)=105+28 (a2=8)=133+24 (a2=9)=157+18 (a2=10)=175+10 (a2=11)=185So, total number of sets A is 185.Wait, but let me verify this because sometimes when I do these step-by-step additions, I might make a mistake.Let me list all the contributions:a2=2:5a2=3:10a2=4:15a2=5:20a2=6:25a2=7:30a2=8:28a2=9:24a2=10:18a2=11:10So, adding them in order:5 +10=1515+15=3030+20=5050+25=7575+30=105105+28=133133+24=157157+18=175175+10=185Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as summing over ( a_2 ) from 2 to 11, the term ( (a_2 -1) times min(5, 12 - a_2) ).But regardless, the total seems to be 185.But wait, let me think again. Is this the correct approach?Alternatively, another way to think about it is to model the problem as placing three elements with certain spacing constraints.But perhaps another method is inclusion-exclusion. Let me see.Total number of 3-element subsets: 220.Number of subsets where ( a_3 - a_2 >5 ). So, we can subtract these from 220.So, how many subsets have ( a_3 - a_2 >5 )?To compute this, for each possible ( a_2 ), count the number of ( a_3 ) such that ( a_3 geq a_2 +6 ), and ( a_1 < a_2 ).So, for each ( a_2 ), the number of ( a_3 ) is ( 12 - (a_2 +5) =7 - a_2 ). Wait, no.Wait, ( a_3 ) must be at least ( a_2 +6 ), so the number of possible ( a_3 ) is ( 12 - (a_2 +5) =7 - a_2 ). But this is only if ( a_2 +6 leq12 ), i.e., ( a_2 leq6 ).Wait, let me clarify.For each ( a_2 ), the number of ( a_3 ) such that ( a_3 geq a_2 +6 ) is ( 12 - (a_2 +5) =7 - a_2 ). But this is only valid if ( a_2 +6 leq12 ), which is ( a_2 leq6 ).So, for ( a_2 leq6 ), the number of ( a_3 ) is (7 - a_2).For ( a_2 >6 ), ( a_3 ) can't be ( a_2 +6 ) because ( a_3 leq12 ), so the number of ( a_3 ) is 0.Therefore, for ( a_2 =2 ) to ( a_2=6 ), the number of ( a_3 ) is (7 - a_2). For ( a_2=7 ) to ( a_2=11 ), it's 0.So, for each ( a_2 ), the number of ( a_3 ) is:- ( a_2=2 ):5- ( a_2=3 ):4- ( a_2=4 ):3- ( a_2=5 ):2- ( a_2=6 ):1- ( a_2=7 ) to (11):0So, the total number of ( (a_2, a_3) ) pairs where ( a_3 - a_2 >5 ) is 5+4+3+2+1=15.For each such pair, the number of ( a_1 ) is ( a_2 -1 ).Therefore, the total number of subsets where ( a_3 - a_2 >5 ) is the sum over ( a_2=2 ) to (6) of ( (a_2 -1) times (7 - a_2) ).Let me compute each term:- ( a_2=2 ): (1 times5=5)- ( a_2=3 ): (2 times4=8)- ( a_2=4 ): (3 times3=9)- ( a_2=5 ): (4 times2=8)- ( a_2=6 ): (5 times1=5)Adding these up:5+8=13, 13+9=22, 22+8=30, 30+5=35.So, there are 35 subsets where ( a_3 - a_2 >5 ).Therefore, the number of subsets where ( a_3 - a_2 leq5 ) is total subsets minus these, which is 220 -35=185.So, that confirms the previous result.Therefore, the number of sets A is 185.Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to model this?Alternatively, perhaps using stars and bars or some combinatorial model.But I think the two methods I've used both lead to 185, so that gives me more confidence.Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem as arranging the three numbers with certain gaps.Let me denote the differences between the numbers.Let ( x_1 = a_1 -1 ), ( x_2 = a_2 - a_1 -1 ), ( x_3 = a_3 - a_2 -1 ), and ( x_4 =12 - a_3 ).These are the gaps before ( a_1 ), between ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ), between ( a_2 ) and ( a_3 ), and after ( a_3 ).Since ( a_1 geq1 ), ( a_2 geq a_1 +1 ), ( a_3 geq a_2 +1 ), and ( a_3 leq12 ), all ( x_i geq0 ).The total sum of gaps is ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 =12 -3=9 ).But we have the condition ( a_3 - a_2 leq5 ), which translates to ( x_3 leq4 ).So, we need to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 =9 ) with ( x_3 leq4 ).The total number without restriction is ( binom{9 +4 -1}{4 -1} = binom{12}{3}=220 ), which matches the total number of subsets.Now, the number of solutions with ( x_3 leq4 ) is equal to the total number minus the number of solutions with ( x_3 geq5 ).The number of solutions with ( x_3 geq5 ) is equal to the number of solutions where ( x_3' =x_3 -5 geq0 ), so ( x_1 +x_2 +x_3' +x_4 =9 -5=4 ). The number of solutions is ( binom{4 +4 -1}{4 -1}= binom{7}{3}=35 ).Therefore, the number of solutions with ( x_3 leq4 ) is (220 -35=185), which again gives the same result.So, this method also confirms that the number is 185.Therefore, I think 185 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The number of sets ( A ) is boxed{185}."},{"question":"The whole numbers from 1 to 1000 are written. How many of these numbers have at least two 7's appearing side-by-side?(A) 10(B) 11(C) 21(D) 30(E) 19","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many numbers from 1 to 1000 have at least two 7's appearing side-by-side. The options are given as (A) 10, (B) 11, (C) 21, (D) 30, (E) 19. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I should clarify what is meant by \\"at least two 7's appearing side-by-side.\\" I think this means that in the number, there should be two 7 digits next to each other, like in 77, 177, 707, 770, 777, etc. So, numbers like 777 would actually have three 7's, but since they have at least two side-by-side, they should be counted as well.Now, the numbers range from 1 to 1000. So, that includes all the numbers from 1 up to and including 1000. I need to consider how these numbers are structured in terms of digits. Numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, from 10 to 99 are two-digit, from 100 to 999 are three-digit, and then 1000 is a four-digit number.Wait, 1000 is a four-digit number, but it's only one number. Let me check if 1000 has two 7's side-by-side. The digits are 1, 0, 0, 0. So, no, it doesn't have any 7's. So, I can ignore 1000 for this problem.So, I need to consider numbers from 1 to 999. These can be broken down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.But since the problem is about having two 7's side-by-side, single-digit numbers can't have two digits, so they can't have two 7's. So, single-digit numbers are out of the question. Therefore, I only need to consider two-digit and three-digit numbers.Let me handle two-digit numbers first. How many two-digit numbers have two 7's side-by-side? Well, the only two-digit number with two 7's is 77. So, that's one number.Now, moving on to three-digit numbers. These are from 100 to 999. Each three-digit number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. So, let's denote them as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit.We need to find all three-digit numbers where at least two of the digits are 7 and are adjacent. So, either A and B are both 7, or B and C are both 7. It's possible for all three digits to be 7, which is 777, but that still counts because it has two 7's side-by-side.So, let's break it down:1. Numbers where the hundreds and tens digits are both 7: So, A=7, B=7, and C can be anything from 0 to 9. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, C can be 0-9, so that's 10 numbers: 770, 771, 772, ..., 779.2. Numbers where the tens and units digits are both 7: So, B=7, C=7, and A can be anything from 1 to 9 (since it's a three-digit number, A can't be 0). So, how many such numbers are there? A can be 1-9, so that's 9 numbers: 177, 277, 377, ..., 977.Wait, but hold on. If I just add these two cases together, 10 + 9 = 19, but I might be double-counting the number 777. Because in the first case, when A=7, B=7, and C=7, that's 777, which is included in the 10 numbers. In the second case, when A=7, B=7, C=7, that's also included in the 9 numbers. So, 777 is being counted twice. Therefore, I need to subtract 1 to correct for the double-counting.So, total three-digit numbers with at least two 7's side-by-side would be 10 + 9 - 1 = 18.But wait, hold on. Let me verify. So, in the first case, numbers from 770 to 779: that's 10 numbers, including 777. In the second case, numbers from 177, 277, ..., 977: that's 9 numbers, including 777. So, yes, 777 is counted twice. So, subtracting 1 gives 18.But wait, earlier I thought of two-digit numbers: only 77. So, in total, numbers from 1 to 999 with at least two 7's side-by-side would be two-digit number 77 plus three-digit numbers 18, so 1 + 18 = 19.But hold on, let me think again. Is that correct? So, two-digit numbers: 77 is one. Three-digit numbers: 18. So, total 19.But wait, hold on. Let me think about the three-digit numbers again.Wait, when I considered the first case, A=7, B=7, C=0-9: that's 10 numbers, including 777.Second case, B=7, C=7, A=1-9: that's 9 numbers, including 777.So, total numbers: 10 + 9 - 1 = 18.Adding the two-digit number 77: 18 + 1 = 19.So, that would be 19 numbers. Hmm, 19 is one of the options, option (E). But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.Wait, is 777 the only number that is being double-counted? Yes, because it's the only number where both A and B are 7, and B and C are 7. So, yes, 777 is the only overlap.So, 10 + 9 - 1 = 18 three-digit numbers. Plus the two-digit number 77, which is 1, so total 19.But hold on, let me think about another approach. Maybe using combinatorics.For two-digit numbers: only 77. So, 1.For three-digit numbers: Let's think about the positions where two 7's can appear.Case 1: The first two digits are 7: So, 77X, where X can be 0-9. So, 10 numbers.Case 2: The last two digits are 7: So, X77, where X can be 1-9. So, 9 numbers.But in both cases, 777 is included in both, so we subtract 1.So, total three-digit numbers: 10 + 9 -1 = 18.Plus two-digit number 77: 1.Total: 19.So, that seems consistent.But wait, hold on. Let me think about numbers like 707. Does that count? Because 707 has two 7's, but they are not side-by-side. So, 707 would not count because the two 7's are separated by a 0. So, only numbers where two 7's are adjacent count.Similarly, 770 has two 7's side-by-side, so that counts. 771, 772, etc., all count.Similarly, 177, 277, etc., have two 7's side-by-side.So, 777 is counted in both cases, but we subtracted it once.So, seems correct.But wait, let me think about another angle. Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle.Total numbers with two 7's in the first two digits: 10 (770-779).Total numbers with two 7's in the last two digits: 9 (177, 277, ..., 977).Intersection: numbers that have two 7's in both first two and last two digits, which is only 777.So, total numbers: 10 + 9 - 1 = 18.Plus the two-digit number 77: 1.Total: 19.So, 19 is the answer, which is option (E).But wait, hold on, let me check if 1000 is included or not. The problem says from 1 to 1000. So, 1000 is included. But 1000 is 1000, which is 1 followed by three 0's. So, it doesn't have any 7's. So, it doesn't affect the count.So, 19 is the total.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Maybe I'm missing some numbers.Wait, for three-digit numbers, are there any other cases where two 7's are adjacent? For example, 707: no, because the two 7's are not adjacent. 717: same thing. So, only numbers where two 7's are in consecutive digit places.So, only the cases where either the first two digits are 7 or the last two digits are 7.So, that seems correct.But let me think about another way. Maybe count all the numbers with two 7's side-by-side, regardless of the position.So, for two-digit numbers: only 77.For three-digit numbers: numbers where either the first two digits are 7 or the last two digits are 7.So, 10 + 9 -1 = 18.So, total 19.But wait, hold on. Let me list them out to make sure.Two-digit numbers: 77.Three-digit numbers:First case: 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 778, 779. That's 10 numbers.Second case: 177, 277, 377, 477, 577, 677, 777, 877, 977. That's 9 numbers.But 777 is in both lists, so total unique numbers: 10 + 9 -1 = 18.Adding 77: 18 +1 =19.So, that's 19 numbers.Wait, but let me list them all to be thorough.Two-digit: 77.Three-digit:From first case: 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 778, 779. That's 10.From second case: 177, 277, 377, 477, 577, 677, 777, 877, 977. That's 9.So, combining these, we have:77, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 778, 779, 177, 277, 377, 477, 577, 677, 877, 977.Wait, that's 1 (77) + 10 (770-779) + 8 (177, 277, 377, 477, 577, 677, 877, 977). Wait, 1 + 10 + 8 = 19.Wait, but in the second case, when I listed them, it was 9 numbers, but 777 was already included in the first case. So, when combining, we have 10 (from first case) + 8 (from second case, excluding 777) + 1 (two-digit 77) = 19.Yes, that seems correct.So, the total numbers are 19.Therefore, the answer should be (E) 19.Wait, but hold on. Let me check if I missed any numbers.Is there a number like 7077? Wait, no, because we're only going up to 1000, so the maximum is 999. So, four-digit numbers aren't included except for 1000, which doesn't have any 7's.So, no, I don't think I missed any numbers.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:For two-digit numbers: only 77.For three-digit numbers:- The first two digits are 7: 770-779: 10 numbers.- The last two digits are 7: 177, 277, 377, 477, 577, 677, 777, 877, 977: 9 numbers.But 777 is counted in both, so total three-digit numbers: 10 + 9 -1 = 18.Adding the two-digit number: 18 +1 =19.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe using permutations.But perhaps that's overcomplicating.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of strings.Each number can be considered as a string of digits. For two-digit numbers, only \\"77\\" is valid.For three-digit numbers, we can have \\"77X\\" or \\"X77\\", where X is any digit (0-9 for \\"77X\\", 1-9 for \\"X77\\" because the first digit can't be 0). So, \\"77X\\" gives 10 numbers, \\"X77\\" gives 9 numbers, but \\"777\\" is in both, so subtract 1.So, 10 + 9 -1 =18.Plus the two-digit number: 18 +1=19.Yes, same result.Therefore, I think 19 is the correct answer.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. The problem says \\"at least two 7's appearing side-by-side.\\" So, does that include numbers with more than two 7's? Like 777, which has three 7's. But in our count, we included 777 once, because we subtracted the overlap.Wait, but in our count, 777 was in both the \\"77X\\" and \\"X77\\" categories, so we subtracted it once, so it's only counted once in the total.So, that's correct.Therefore, 19 is the correct count.So, the answer is (E) 19.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Given three points A(2,-3), B(4,3), and C(5,m) are on the same line, then m= ______.","answer":"To determine the value of ( m ) such that the points ( A(2, -3) ), ( B(4, 3) ), and ( C(5, m) ) are collinear, I can use the concept of slope.First, I'll calculate the slope of the line connecting points ( A ) and ( B ).

It's a three-digit number where (a), (b), and (c) are its digits. So, (overline{a b c}) can be expressed as (100a + 10b + c). Got that.The equation given is:[100a + 10b + c = 37(a + b + c)]Alright, so I can rewrite this equation to make it easier to work with. Let me subtract (37(a + b + c)) from both sides to bring everything to one side:[100a + 10b + c - 37a - 37b - 37c = 0]Simplifying the terms:- (100a - 37a = 63a)- (10b - 37b = -27b)- (c - 37c = -36c)So, the equation becomes:[63a - 27b - 36c = 0]Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it further by dividing all terms by a common factor. Let me see, 63, 27, and 36 all are divisible by 9. Let's try that:- (63 ÷ 9 = 7)- (27 ÷ 9 = 3)- (36 ÷ 9 = 4)So, dividing each term by 9, the equation simplifies to:[7a - 3b - 4c = 0]That's better. So now, the equation is:[7a = 3b + 4c]Alright, so (7a) is equal to the sum of (3b) and (4c). Remember, (a), (b), and (c) are digits, so (a) can be from 1 to 9 (since it's a three-digit number), and (b) and (c) can be from 0 to 9.So, my goal is to find all possible combinations of (a), (b), and (c) such that (7a = 3b + 4c), with the constraints on the digits.Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express (a) in terms of (b) and (c), or perhaps fix (a) and find possible (b) and (c) that satisfy the equation. Let me try the second approach because (a) is from 1 to 9, which is manageable.So, for each (a) from 1 to 9, I can compute (7a) and then find all pairs ((b, c)) such that (3b + 4c = 7a). Since (b) and (c) are digits, (3b) can range from 0 to 27, and (4c) can range from 0 to 36. Therefore, (3b + 4c) can range from 0 to 63. But since (7a) is from 7 to 63 (because (a) is from 1 to 9), the possible values of (7a) are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63.So, for each (a), (7a) is fixed, and I need to find the number of solutions ((b, c)) such that (3b + 4c = 7a). Let's tackle each (a) one by one.Starting with (a = 1):- (7a = 7)- So, (3b + 4c = 7)- (b) and (c) are digits (0-9)- Let's find all pairs ((b, c)) that satisfy this.Let me solve for (b) in terms of (c):[3b = 7 - 4c b = frac{7 - 4c}{3}]Since (b) must be an integer between 0 and 9, (7 - 4c) must be divisible by 3, and the result must be between 0 and 9.Let me check possible (c) values:- (c = 0): (7 - 0 = 7), 7/3 ≈ 2.333, not integer.- (c = 1): (7 - 4 = 3), 3/3 = 1. So, (b = 1). Valid.- (c = 2): (7 - 8 = -1), negative. Not valid.- (c = 3): (7 - 12 = -5), negative. Not valid.- Similarly, higher (c) will only make it more negative.So, only (c = 1) gives a valid (b = 1). So, one solution for (a = 1).Next, (a = 2):- (7a = 14)- (3b + 4c = 14)- Solve for (b):[3b = 14 - 4c b = frac{14 - 4c}{3}]Again, (b) must be integer between 0 and 9.Let's check (c) values:- (c = 0): 14/3 ≈ 4.666, not integer.- (c = 1): (14 - 4 = 10), 10/3 ≈ 3.333, not integer.- (c = 2): (14 - 8 = 6), 6/3 = 2. So, (b = 2). Valid.- (c = 3): (14 - 12 = 2), 2/3 ≈ 0.666, not integer.- (c = 4): (14 - 16 = -2), negative. Not valid.- Higher (c) will make it more negative.So, only (c = 2) gives (b = 2). One solution for (a = 2).Moving on to (a = 3):- (7a = 21)- (3b + 4c = 21)- Solving for (b):[3b = 21 - 4c b = frac{21 - 4c}{3} = 7 - frac{4c}{3}]So, (4c) must be divisible by 3 for (b) to be integer.Let me check (c) values where (4c) is divisible by 3. Since 4 and 3 are coprime, (c) must be divisible by 3.Possible (c) values: 0, 3, 6, 9.Check each:- (c = 0): (b = 7 - 0 = 7). Valid.- (c = 3): (b = 7 - 4 = 3). Valid.- (c = 6): (b = 7 - 8 = -1). Invalid.- (c = 9): (b = 7 - 12 = -5). Invalid.So, (c = 0) and (c = 3) are valid. Thus, two solutions for (a = 3).Next, (a = 4):- (7a = 28)- (3b + 4c = 28)- Solving for (b):[3b = 28 - 4c b = frac{28 - 4c}{3}]Again, (28 - 4c) must be divisible by 3.Let me check possible (c) values:Let me express (28 - 4c) modulo 3:28 mod 3 = 1, 4 mod 3 = 1, so (28 - 4c) mod 3 = (1 - c) mod 3.We need (1 - c equiv 0 mod 3), so (c equiv 1 mod 3).Thus, (c) can be 1, 4, 7.Check each:- (c = 1): (28 - 4 = 24), (24/3 = 8). So, (b = 8). Valid.- (c = 4): (28 - 16 = 12), (12/3 = 4). (b = 4). Valid.- (c = 7): (28 - 28 = 0), (0/3 = 0). (b = 0). Valid.So, three solutions for (a = 4).Moving on to (a = 5):- (7a = 35)- (3b + 4c = 35)- Solving for (b):[3b = 35 - 4c b = frac{35 - 4c}{3}]Again, (35 - 4c) must be divisible by 3.Let me compute (35 - 4c) mod 3:35 mod 3 = 2, 4 mod 3 = 1, so (35 - 4c) mod 3 = (2 - c) mod 3.Set equal to 0: (2 - c equiv 0 mod 3) => (c equiv 2 mod 3).So, (c) can be 2, 5, 8.Check each:- (c = 2): (35 - 8 = 27), (27/3 = 9). (b = 9). Valid.- (c = 5): (35 - 20 = 15), (15/3 = 5). (b = 5). Valid.- (c = 8): (35 - 32 = 3), (3/3 = 1). (b = 1). Valid.So, three solutions for (a = 5).Next, (a = 6):- (7a = 42)- (3b + 4c = 42)- Solving for (b):[3b = 42 - 4c b = frac{42 - 4c}{3} = 14 - frac{4c}{3}]So, (4c) must be divisible by 3, which implies (c) must be divisible by 3.Possible (c) values: 0, 3, 6, 9.Check each:- (c = 0): (b = 14 - 0 = 14). But (b) must be ≤ 9. Invalid.- (c = 3): (b = 14 - 4 = 10). Still, (b = 10) is invalid.- (c = 6): (b = 14 - 8 = 6). Valid.- (c = 9): (b = 14 - 12 = 2). Valid.So, (c = 6) and (c = 9) give valid (b). Thus, two solutions for (a = 6).Moving on to (a = 7):- (7a = 49)- (3b + 4c = 49)- Solving for (b):[3b = 49 - 4c b = frac{49 - 4c}{3}]Again, (49 - 4c) must be divisible by 3.Compute (49 - 4c) mod 3:49 mod 3 = 1, 4 mod 3 = 1, so (49 - 4c) mod 3 = (1 - c) mod 3.Set equal to 0: (1 - c equiv 0 mod 3) => (c equiv 1 mod 3).So, (c) can be 1, 4, 7.Check each:- (c = 1): (49 - 4 = 45), (45/3 = 15). (b = 15). Invalid (since (b) must be ≤ 9).- (c = 4): (49 - 16 = 33), (33/3 = 11). (b = 11). Invalid.- (c = 7): (49 - 28 = 21), (21/3 = 7). (b = 7). Valid.So, only (c = 7) gives a valid (b = 7). One solution for (a = 7).Next, (a = 8):- (7a = 56)- (3b + 4c = 56)- Solving for (b):[3b = 56 - 4c b = frac{56 - 4c}{3}]Again, (56 - 4c) must be divisible by 3.Compute (56 - 4c) mod 3:56 mod 3 = 2, 4 mod 3 = 1, so (56 - 4c) mod 3 = (2 - c) mod 3.Set equal to 0: (2 - c equiv 0 mod 3) => (c equiv 2 mod 3).So, (c) can be 2, 5, 8.Check each:- (c = 2): (56 - 8 = 48), (48/3 = 16). (b = 16). Invalid.- (c = 5): (56 - 20 = 36), (36/3 = 12). (b = 12). Invalid.- (c = 8): (56 - 32 = 24), (24/3 = 8). (b = 8). Valid.So, only (c = 8) gives a valid (b = 8). One solution for (a = 8).Finally, (a = 9):- (7a = 63)- (3b + 4c = 63)- Solving for (b):[3b = 63 - 4c b = frac{63 - 4c}{3} = 21 - frac{4c}{3}]So, (4c) must be divisible by 3, which implies (c) must be divisible by 3.Possible (c) values: 0, 3, 6, 9.Check each:- (c = 0): (b = 21 - 0 = 21). Invalid.- (c = 3): (b = 21 - 4 = 17). Invalid.- (c = 6): (b = 21 - 8 = 13). Invalid.- (c = 9): (b = 21 - 12 = 9). Valid.So, only (c = 9) gives a valid (b = 9). One solution for (a = 9).Now, let me tabulate the number of solutions for each (a):- (a = 1): 1- (a = 2): 1- (a = 3): 2- (a = 4): 3- (a = 5): 3- (a = 6): 2- (a = 7): 1- (a = 8): 1- (a = 9): 1Let me add these up:1 + 1 = 22 + 2 = 44 + 3 = 77 + 3 = 1010 + 2 = 1212 + 1 = 1313 + 1 = 1414 + 1 = 15Wait, that's 15? But let me recount:- (a=1):1Total:1- (a=2):1Total:2- (a=3):2Total:4- (a=4):3Total:7- (a=5):3Total:10- (a=6):2Total:12- (a=7):1Total:13- (a=8):1Total:14- (a=9):1Total:15Hmm, so total 15 solutions. But the options are A.13, B.14, C.15, D.16. So, is it 15? But let me make sure I didn't overcount or undercount.Wait, let me recount each (a):- (a=1):1- (a=2):1- (a=3):2- (a=4):3- (a=5):3- (a=6):2- (a=7):1- (a=8):1- (a=9):1Adding them: 1+1=2, +2=4, +3=7, +3=10, +2=12, +1=13, +1=14, +1=15. So, 15 in total.But wait, the options include 15 as option C. So, is 15 the correct answer? But I thought maybe I made a mistake because sometimes when you have multiple solutions, you might have duplicates or something, but in this case, each solution is unique because each (a), (b), (c) combination is unique.Wait, let me check for (a=3), we had two solutions: (3,7,0) and (3,3,3). Are these valid?Yes, because (3b + 4c = 21):- For (c=0), (3b = 21) => (b=7). So, number is 370.- For (c=3), (3b + 12 = 21) => (3b=9) => (b=3). So, number is 333.Both are valid three-digit numbers.Similarly, for (a=4), three solutions:- (c=1), (b=8): 481- (c=4), (b=4): 444- (c=7), (b=0): 407All valid.For (a=5), three solutions:- (c=2), (b=9): 592- (c=5), (b=5): 555- (c=8), (b=1): 518All valid.For (a=6), two solutions:- (c=6), (b=6): 666- (c=9), (b=2): 629Valid.For (a=7), one solution:- (c=7), (b=7): 777Valid.For (a=8), one solution:- (c=8), (b=8): 888Valid.For (a=9), one solution:- (c=9), (b=9): 999Valid.So, all these numbers are distinct, and each satisfies the condition. So, 15 numbers in total.But wait, the options are A.13, B.14, C.15, D.16. So, 15 is an option, so the answer should be C.15.But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't miss any constraints or make any calculation errors.Wait, when (a=3), (c=0): 370. Let me check if 370 = 37*(3+7+0) = 37*10 = 370. Yes, that's correct.Similarly, 333: 37*(3+3+3)=37*9=333. Correct.For (a=4), 481: 37*(4+8+1)=37*13=481. Correct.444: 37*(4+4+4)=37*12=444. Correct.407: 37*(4+0+7)=37*11=407. Correct.For (a=5), 592: 37*(5+9+2)=37*16=592. Correct.555: 37*(5+5+5)=37*15=555. Correct.518: 37*(5+1+8)=37*14=518. Correct.For (a=6), 666: 37*(6+6+6)=37*18=666. Correct.629: 37*(6+2+9)=37*17=629. Correct.For (a=7), 777: 37*(7+7+7)=37*21=777. Correct.For (a=8), 888: 37*(8+8+8)=37*24=888. Correct.For (a=9), 999: 37*(9+9+9)=37*27=999. Correct.So, all 15 numbers satisfy the condition, so the answer is 15.But wait, the options are A.13, B.14, C.15, D.16. So, 15 is an option, so I think the answer is C.15.But just to make sure, let me recount the number of solutions:- (a=1):1- (a=2):1- (a=3):2- (a=4):3- (a=5):3- (a=6):2- (a=7):1- (a=8):1- (a=9):1Total: 1+1+2+3+3+2+1+1+1=15.Yes, that's correct.So, the number of such three-digit numbers is 15. So, the answer is C.15.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Prove that if (G) is the centroid of (triangle ABC), and the medians (AD), (BE), and (CF) intersect the circumcircle of (triangle ABC) at (A'), (B'), and (C') respectively, then[ frac{AG}{A'G} cdot frac{BG}{B'G} cdot frac{CG}{C'G} leq 1.]","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says that if G is the centroid of triangle ABC, and the medians AD, BE, and CF intersect the circumcircle of triangle ABC at A', B', and C' respectively, then the product (AG/A'G) * (BG/B'G) * (CG/C'G) is less than or equal to 1. Hmm, interesting. I need to prove this inequality.First, let me recall some properties of centroids and medians. The centroid G divides each median in the ratio 2:1, right? So, AG is twice as long as GD, BG is twice as long as GE, and CG is twice as long as GF. That might come in handy.Now, the medians AD, BE, and CF intersect the circumcircle again at A', B', and C'. So, each median is extended beyond the centroid to meet the circumcircle. I need to find the ratios AG/A'G, BG/B'G, and CG/C'G, and then show that their product is at most 1.Maybe I can use some properties of circles and power of a point. The Power of a Point theorem relates the lengths of segments created by chords intersecting at a point. Since G is inside the circle, the power of G with respect to the circumcircle should be negative, right? The formula is GA * GA' = GB * GB' = GC * GC' = power of G.Wait, let me write that down. The power of point G with respect to the circumcircle of ABC is equal to GA * GA' = GB * GB' = GC * GC'. That's a key relation.Let me denote the power of G as P. So, GA * GA' = GB * GB' = GC * GC' = P. Since G is inside the circle, P is negative, but maybe I can work with absolute values for simplicity.So, GA * GA' = P, which implies GA' = P / GA. Similarly, GB' = P / GB, and GC' = P / GC.But I need the ratios AG/A'G, BG/B'G, and CG/C'G. Let's express A'G in terms of GA and GA'.From the median, we know that GA is 2/3 of the median length, and GD is 1/3. But when extended to A', GA' is the entire length from G to A', which is GA + A'G? Wait, no. Wait, actually, A' is on the circumcircle, so the median AD is extended beyond D to A', right? So, the length from A to G is AG, and from G to A' is A'G. So, the entire length from A to A' is AG + GA'?Wait, no, that's not correct. Because G is between A and D, and D is the midpoint of BC. So, the median AD is from A to D, and then extended beyond D to A'. So, the order is A, G, D, A'. So, AG is from A to G, GD is from G to D, and DA' is from D to A'. So, GA' is GD + DA'. Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, maybe I can express A'G in terms of GA. Since GA * GA' = P, then GA' = P / GA. So, A'G is the same as GA', right? Wait, no. Wait, GA' is the length from G to A', but GA is from G to A. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.Wait, actually, the power of point G with respect to the circumcircle is GA * GA' = GB * GB' = GC * GC'. So, GA * GA' = GB * GB' = GC * GC' = P. So, GA' = P / GA, GB' = P / GB, GC' = P / GC.But GA' is the length from G to A', right? So, if I have GA * GA' = P, then GA' = P / GA. So, A'G = GA' = P / GA. Similarly, B'G = GB' = P / GB, and C'G = GC' = P / GC.Wait, but in the ratio AG/A'G, that would be AG divided by (P / AG). So, AG / (P / AG) = (AG)^2 / P. Similarly, BG / B'G = (BG)^2 / P, and CG / C'G = (CG)^2 / P.Therefore, the product (AG/A'G) * (BG/B'G) * (CG/C'G) is equal to [(AG)^2 / P] * [(BG)^2 / P] * [(CG)^2 / P] = (AG * BG * CG)^2 / P^3.So, the product is (AG * BG * CG)^2 / P^3. Hmm, so I need to show that this is less than or equal to 1.So, (AG * BG * CG)^2 / P^3 ≤ 1, which implies (AG * BG * CG)^2 ≤ P^3.Alternatively, taking square roots, AG * BG * CG ≤ P^(3/2). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Wait, maybe I need to express P in terms of AG, BG, CG.Since GA * GA' = P, and GA' = A'G, so P = GA * A'G. Similarly, P = GB * B'G and P = GC * C'G.But since G is the centroid, AG = 2/3 of the median from A, BG = 2/3 of the median from B, CG = 2/3 of the median from C.Let me denote the lengths of the medians as m_a, m_b, m_c. So, AG = (2/3) m_a, BG = (2/3) m_b, CG = (2/3) m_c.Then, GA' = P / AG = (P) / ( (2/3) m_a ) = (3P)/(2 m_a). Similarly, GB' = (3P)/(2 m_b), GC' = (3P)/(2 m_c).But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I can express P in terms of the sides of the triangle or something else.Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to make things more concrete.Let me place centroid G at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the coordinates of A, B, C can be represented such that their centroid is at the origin. So, if A is (x1, y1), B is (x2, y2), C is (x3, y3), then (x1 + x2 + x3)/3 = 0, similarly for y's.But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I can use barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC. In barycentric coordinates, the centroid G has coordinates (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).In barycentric coordinates, the equation of the circumcircle can be written, and the medians can be parametrized. Then, the points A', B', C' can be found by intersecting the medians with the circumcircle.But barycentric coordinates might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors. Let me denote vectors with position vectors relative to G as the origin. So, let me set G as the origin. Then, the position vectors of A, B, C satisfy (A + B + C)/3 = G = 0, so A + B + C = 0.So, A + B + C = 0. That might be useful.Now, the circumcircle of triangle ABC can be represented in vector terms. The equation of the circumcircle is |X - O|^2 = R^2, where O is the circumcenter and R is the circumradius.But since we're working with vectors relative to G, which is the centroid, and O is another point, perhaps we can express O in terms of A, B, C.Wait, in general, the circumcenter O can be expressed in terms of the centroid G and the symmedian point or something else, but maybe that's too vague.Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the median AD. Since AD is a median, D is the midpoint of BC. Since A + B + C = 0, then D = (B + C)/2 = (-A)/2, because B + C = -A.So, the median AD goes from A to D = (-A)/2. So, the parametric equation of AD can be written as A + t(D - A) = A + t(-A/2 - A) = A - (3t/2) A = A(1 - 3t/2).Wait, but that might not be the best way. Alternatively, parametrize from A to D: any point on AD can be written as A + t(D - A) where t ranges from 0 to 1 for the median, and beyond for the extension.So, when t = 0, it's A; t = 1, it's D; t = something else, it's beyond D.We need to find the other intersection point A' of AD with the circumcircle. So, we can write the parametric equation of AD and find t such that the point lies on the circumcircle.Given that G is the centroid, which is at the origin, and the centroid divides AD in the ratio 2:1, so AG = 2 GD. So, G is located at t = 2/3 along AD from A to D.So, in parametric terms, G corresponds to t = 2/3. So, the point A' is another intersection point, which would correspond to some t beyond D, i.e., t > 1.So, let's write the parametric equation of AD as:X(t) = A + t(D - A) = A + t(-A/2 - A) = A - (3t/2) A = A(1 - 3t/2).Wait, that seems off. Let me check.Wait, D is the midpoint of BC, so D = (B + C)/2. Since A + B + C = 0, then B + C = -A, so D = (-A)/2.So, D = -A/2. Therefore, the vector from A to D is D - A = (-A/2 - A) = (-3A/2).Therefore, the parametric equation of AD is A + t*(-3A/2) = A(1 - 3t/2).So, when t = 0, it's A; t = 1, it's D; t = 2/3, it's G; t = something else, it's A'.Now, we need to find t such that X(t) lies on the circumcircle. The circumcircle passes through A, B, C, so we can write the equation for X(t) being on the circumcircle.But since we're working in vectors, maybe it's better to use the property that |X(t) - O|^2 = R^2, where O is the circumcenter.But since we don't know O, maybe we can use another approach. Alternatively, since A, B, C lie on the circumcircle, we can use the fact that the power of G with respect to the circumcircle is GA * GA' = GB * GB' = GC * GC' = P.Wait, earlier I thought about that. So, GA * GA' = P, which is the power of G.But since G is the centroid, which is inside the circle, P is negative. So, GA * GA' = P < 0.But GA is a length, so it's positive, which would imply GA' is negative, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I need to consider directed lengths.In power of a point, the lengths are signed. So, if G is inside the circle, then GA and GA' are in opposite directions, so GA * GA' is negative. So, GA' is negative in that case.But in terms of absolute values, |GA| * |GA'| = |P|.So, maybe I can write |GA| * |GA'| = |P|, and since GA and GA' are in opposite directions, GA' is negative, so GA' = - |GA'|.Therefore, GA * GA' = - |GA| * |GA'| = P, so P is negative.But maybe I can just work with absolute values for the ratios.So, |AG| / |A'G| = |AG| / |GA'| = |AG| / (|P| / |AG|) = |AG|^2 / |P|.Similarly for the others.Therefore, the product becomes (|AG|^2 / |P|) * (|BG|^2 / |P|) * (|CG|^2 / |P|) = (|AG| |BG| |CG|)^2 / |P|^3.So, to show that this is ≤ 1, we need (|AG| |BG| |CG|)^2 ≤ |P|^3.So, (|AG| |BG| |CG|)^2 ≤ |P|^3.Hmm, so perhaps I can relate |P| to |AG|, |BG|, |CG|.But |P| is the absolute value of the power of G with respect to the circumcircle, which is |GA * GA'| = |GB * GB'| = |GC * GC'|.So, |P| = |GA| * |GA'| = |GB| * |GB'| = |GC| * |GC'|.But since G is the centroid, we have |GA| = 2/3 |AD|, |GB| = 2/3 |BE|, |GC| = 2/3 |CF|, where AD, BE, CF are the lengths of the medians.But I don't know if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can express |P| in terms of the sides of the triangle.Wait, the power of G can also be expressed as |OG|^2 - R^2, where O is the circumcenter. But since G is the centroid, and O is the circumcenter, we have the relation OG^2 = R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9, from the formula in triangle geometry.Wait, let me recall the formula: In any triangle, the distance between centroid G and circumcenter O is given by OG^2 = R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9.So, the power of G with respect to the circumcircle is |P| = |OG^2 - R^2| = |(R^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9) - R^2| = | - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9 | = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9.Wait, that's interesting. So, |P| = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9.So, |P| is equal to (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9.Now, I need to express |AG|, |BG|, |CG| in terms of the sides.We know that in a triangle, the length of a median can be expressed as:m_a = (1/2) sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2).Similarly for m_b and m_c.Since |AG| = (2/3) m_a, so |AG| = (2/3) * (1/2) sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2) = (1/3) sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2).Similarly, |BG| = (1/3) sqrt(2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2), and |CG| = (1/3) sqrt(2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2).So, |AG| |BG| |CG| = (1/3)^3 sqrt{(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)(2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2)(2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2)}.Therefore, (|AG| |BG| |CG|)^2 = (1/3)^6 * (2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)(2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2)(2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2).On the other hand, |P|^3 = [(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9]^3 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^3 / 9^3.So, I need to show that:(1/3)^6 * (2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)(2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2)(2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2) ≤ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^3 / 9^3.Simplify the left-hand side:(1/729) * (2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)(2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2)(2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2).Right-hand side:(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^3 / 729.So, the inequality becomes:(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)(2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2)(2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2) ≤ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^3.So, I need to show that the product of these three terms on the left is less than or equal to the cube of the sum on the right.Hmm, this seems like a symmetric inequality. Maybe I can use AM ≥ GM or some other inequality.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for positive real numbers x, y, z, we have (x + y + z)^3 ≥ something.Wait, let me denote x = a^2, y = b^2, z = c^2. Then, the inequality becomes:(2y + 2z - x)(2x + 2z - y)(2x + 2y - z) ≤ (x + y + z)^3.So, I need to show that (2y + 2z - x)(2x + 2z - y)(2x + 2y - z) ≤ (x + y + z)^3, where x, y, z are positive real numbers.Hmm, this seems like a known inequality. Maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality or some substitution.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the substitution u = x + y + z, v = xy + yz + zx, w = xyz, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, maybe I can expand both sides and compare.Let me try expanding the left-hand side:First, compute (2y + 2z - x)(2x + 2z - y):Let me denote A = 2y + 2z - x, B = 2x + 2z - y.Compute A * B:= (2y + 2z - x)(2x + 2z - y)= 2y*(2x) + 2y*(2z) + 2y*(-y) + 2z*(2x) + 2z*(2z) + 2z*(-y) - x*(2x) - x*(2z) + x*yWait, this is getting messy. Maybe a better approach is to use the distributive property step by step.Alternatively, perhaps I can note that each term on the left is of the form 2(y + z) - x, so maybe I can write each term as 2S - x, where S = x + y + z.Wait, no, because 2(y + z) - x = 2(S - x) - x = 2S - 2x - x = 2S - 3x. Similarly, 2x + 2z - y = 2S - 3y, and 2x + 2y - z = 2S - 3z.Therefore, the left-hand side becomes (2S - 3x)(2S - 3y)(2S - 3z).So, the inequality is:(2S - 3x)(2S - 3y)(2S - 3z) ≤ S^3,where S = x + y + z.So, we need to show that (2S - 3x)(2S - 3y)(2S - 3z) ≤ S^3.Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression or use some inequality.Alternatively, let me consider the function f(t) = ln(2S - 3t). Then, the left-hand side is exp(f(x) + f(y) + f(z)). But I don't know if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM-GM inequality on the terms (2S - 3x), (2S - 3y), (2S - 3z).Wait, but AM-GM would give that the product is less than or equal to something, but I need the product to be less than or equal to S^3.Alternatively, maybe I can use the inequality between arithmetic and geometric means.Let me consider the three terms:A = 2S - 3x,B = 2S - 3y,C = 2S - 3z.We can write A + B + C = 6S - 3(x + y + z) = 6S - 3S = 3S.So, the arithmetic mean of A, B, C is (A + B + C)/3 = S.Now, by AM ≥ GM,(A + B + C)/3 ≥ (ABC)^(1/3),which implies S ≥ (ABC)^(1/3),so S^3 ≥ ABC,which is exactly what we need: ABC ≤ S^3.Therefore, (2S - 3x)(2S - 3y)(2S - 3z) ≤ S^3.Hence, the inequality holds.So, going back, we have:(|AG| |BG| |CG|)^2 ≤ |P|^3,which implies that (AG/A'G)(BG/B'G)(CG/C'G) ≤ 1.Therefore, the original inequality is proven.Wait, let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps.1. Expressed the power of G with respect to the circumcircle as GA * GA' = GB * GB' = GC * GC' = P.2. Expressed the ratios AG/A'G, BG/B'G, CG/C'G in terms of AG, BG, CG, and P.3. Found that the product of these ratios is (AG * BG * CG)^2 / |P|^3.4. Expressed |P| as (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/9.5. Expressed AG, BG, CG in terms of the medians, which are functions of the sides.6. Transformed the inequality into a symmetric form in terms of x = a^2, y = b^2, z = c^2.7. Showed that the product (2S - 3x)(2S - 3y)(2S - 3z) ≤ S^3 using AM ≥ GM.8. Concluded that the original inequality holds.Yes, that seems solid. I think this proves the required inequality."},{"question":"Given two lines l_1: ax+3y-3=0, l_2: 4x+6y-1=0. If l_1 parallel l_2, then a= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: there are two lines, l₁ and l₂. The equations are given as l₁: ax + 3y - 3 = 0 and l₂: 4x + 6y - 1 = 0. The question is asking, if l₁ is parallel to l₂, then what is the value of a? Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal. So, I need to find the slopes of both lines and set them equal to each other. That should give me an equation to solve for a. But wait, how do I find the slope of a line from its equation?I think the standard form of a line is ax + by + c = 0, and the slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope. So, maybe I can rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form to find their slopes.Let me start with l₁: ax + 3y - 3 = 0. I need to solve for y. So, subtract ax and add 3 to both sides:3y = -ax + 3Now, divide both sides by 3:y = (-a/3)x + 1Okay, so the slope of l₁ is -a/3.Now, let's do the same for l₂: 4x + 6y - 1 = 0. Solve for y.Subtract 4x and add 1 to both sides:6y = -4x + 1Divide both sides by 6:y = (-4/6)x + 1/6Simplify -4/6 to -2/3:y = (-2/3)x + 1/6So, the slope of l₂ is -2/3.Since the lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Therefore, the slope of l₁, which is -a/3, should equal the slope of l₂, which is -2/3.So, set them equal:-a/3 = -2/3Hmm, okay. Let me solve for a. Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominators:-a = -2Now, multiply both sides by -1:a = 2Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my steps.Starting from l₁: ax + 3y - 3 = 0. Solving for y:3y = -ax + 3y = (-a/3)x + 1. That looks correct.For l₂: 4x + 6y - 1 = 0. Solving for y:6y = -4x + 1y = (-4/6)x + 1/6, which simplifies to y = (-2/3)x + 1/6. That also looks correct.Setting the slopes equal: -a/3 = -2/3. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives -a = -2, so a = 2. Yeah, that seems right.But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the condition for parallel lines in standard form.I recall that for two lines in standard form, A₁x + B₁y + C₁ = 0 and A₂x + B₂y + C₂ = 0, the lines are parallel if A₁/B₁ = A₂/B₂, provided that B₁ and B₂ are not zero. Is that correct?Let me verify. If two lines are parallel, their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector can be found from the coefficients of x and y. For a line Ax + By + C = 0, the direction vector is (B, -A). So, for l₁, the direction vector is (3, -a), and for l₂, it's (6, -4). If they are parallel, then (3, -a) should be a scalar multiple of (6, -4).So, there exists some scalar k such that 3 = k*6 and -a = k*(-4). Let's solve for k from the first equation: 3 = 6k => k = 3/6 = 1/2.Then, plug k into the second equation: -a = (1/2)*(-4) => -a = -2 => a = 2. Same result. So, that confirms it.Alternatively, using the condition A₁/B₁ = A₂/B₂. For l₁, A₁ = a, B₁ = 3; for l₂, A₂ = 4, B₂ = 6. So, a/3 = 4/6. Simplify 4/6 to 2/3. So, a/3 = 2/3 => a = 2. Yep, same answer.So, regardless of the method I use, I get a = 2. That seems consistent.Wait, but just to make sure, let me plug a = 2 back into l₁ and see if the lines are indeed parallel.So, l₁ becomes 2x + 3y - 3 = 0. Let's write it in slope-intercept form:3y = -2x + 3y = (-2/3)x + 1And l₂ is 4x + 6y - 1 = 0, which we already converted to y = (-2/3)x + 1/6.So, both lines have the same slope of -2/3, which means they are parallel. Perfect, that checks out.I think I'm confident now that a = 2 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"George and two of his friends go to a famous jiaozi restaurant, which serves only two kinds of jiaozi: pork jiaozi, and vegetable jiaozi. Each person orders exactly  15  jiaozi. How many different ways could the three of them order? Two ways of ordering are different if one person orders a different number of pork jiaozi in both orders.","answer":"Okay, so George and his two friends are going to this jiaozi restaurant, and they only serve two kinds: pork and vegetable. Each person is going to order exactly 15 jiaozi. I need to figure out how many different ways the three of them could order. The key here is that two ways are different if at least one person orders a different number of pork jiaozi. So, it's about the combinations each person can have, and then combining those across the three people.Let me break this down. First, let's think about one person. Each person is ordering 15 jiaozi, which can be either pork or vegetable. So, for each person, the number of pork jiaozi they can order can range from 0 to 15, right? Because they could order all vegetable or all pork. For each number of pork jiaozi, the number of vegetable jiaozi is determined since the total is fixed at 15.So, for one person, the number of different ways they can order is the number of ways to choose how many pork jiaozi they want. That would be 16 possibilities because 0 through 15 inclusive is 16 numbers. So, each person has 16 choices.Now, since there are three people—George and his two friends—each of them independently chooses their own number of pork jiaozi. So, the total number of ways they can order is the product of the number of choices each person has. That is, 16 multiplied by itself three times, which is 16^3.Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Each person's order is independent, so the choices don't affect each other. So, yeah, for each of the three, it's 16 options, so 16*16*16.Calculating that, 16*16 is 256, and 256*16 is 4096. So, 4096 different ways.But hold on, is there a different way to think about this? Maybe using combinations or something else?For one person, the number of ways is the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation p + v = 15, where p is pork and v is vegetable. The number of solutions is C(15 + 2 - 1, 2 - 1) = C(16,1) = 16, which matches what I thought earlier.So, for each person, it's 16 choices. Since the three people are independent, the total number of ways is 16^3.Alternatively, if I think about it as each person's order being a pair (p, v) where p + v = 15, then each person has 16 such pairs. Since the three orders are independent, the total number is 16*16*16.Another way to think about it is that each person is making a binary choice for each jiaozi, but since they have to order exactly 15, it's not exactly binary choices per jiaozi. Instead, it's a choice of how many pork and how many vegetable. So, yeah, it's 16 choices per person.Wait, but is there a possibility that the restaurant has a limited number of jiaozi? The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the number available, so I think we can assume that they can order any number without worrying about availability.Therefore, each person independently chooses their pork count from 0 to 15, so 16 options each, leading to 16^3 total combinations.Calculating 16^3: 16*16 is 256, 256*16 is 4096. So, 4096 different ways.I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.Each person has 16 choices, three people, independent choices, so 16*16*16=4096. Yeah, that seems right.**Final Answer**The number of different ways the three could order is boxed{4096}."},{"question":"A shop specializing in small refrigerators sells an average of 50 refrigerators per month. The cost of each refrigerator is 1200. Since shipping is included in the sale, the shop needs to pay a 20 shipping fee for each refrigerator. In addition, the shop has to pay a \\"storefront fee\\" of 10,000 to the JD website each month, and 5000 for repairs. What is the minimum selling price for each small refrigerator in order for the shop to maintain a monthly sales profit margin of at least 20%?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a shop that sells small refrigerators. They want to figure out the minimum selling price per refrigerator to maintain a 20% monthly sales profit margin. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me list out all the given information:- They sell an average of 50 refrigerators per month.- Each refrigerator costs them 1200.- There's a 20 shipping fee per refrigerator.- They have a storefront fee of 10,000 each month on the JD website.- They also pay 5,000 for repairs each month.They want a profit margin of at least 20%. So, I need to figure out the minimum selling price per refrigerator that would allow them to make this profit.Alright, let's start by understanding what a profit margin is. A profit margin is the percentage of profit relative to the selling price. So, a 20% profit margin means that 20% of the selling price is profit, and the remaining 80% covers the costs.So, if I denote the selling price as 'P', then the profit per refrigerator would be 0.20 * P, and the cost per refrigerator would be 0.80 * P.But wait, the cost per refrigerator isn't just the cost of the refrigerator itself. They also have shipping fees, storefront fees, and repair costs. So, I need to calculate the total cost per refrigerator, considering all these expenses.Let me structure this:1. **Cost of Refrigerator:** 1200 per unit.2. **Shipping Cost:** 20 per unit.3. **Storefront Fee:** 10,000 per month.4. **Repair Costs:** 5,000 per month.Since they sell 50 refrigerators per month, I can calculate the total cost per month and then find the cost per refrigerator.Let's compute the total monthly costs:- **Total Cost of Refrigerators:** 50 units * 1200 = 60,000.- **Total Shipping Cost:** 50 units * 20 = 1,000.- **Storefront Fee:** 10,000.- **Repair Costs:** 5,000.Adding these up: 60,000 + 1,000 + 10,000 + 5,000 = 76,000.So, the total monthly cost is 76,000.Now, to find the cost per refrigerator, I can divide this by the number of units sold:76,000 / 50 = 1,520 per refrigerator.Wait, so each refrigerator effectively costs them 1,520 when considering all expenses.But hold on, the cost of the refrigerator itself is 1,200, and shipping is 20, so per unit, that's 1,220. Then, the other costs are fixed: 10,000 + 5,000 = 15,000 per month. So, if I spread that over 50 units, it's 15,000 / 50 = 300 per refrigerator.So, total cost per refrigerator is 1,220 + 300 = 1,520. Yep, that matches what I had earlier.So, each refrigerator costs them 1,520 in total.Now, they want a profit margin of at least 20%. As I thought earlier, profit margin is calculated on the selling price. So, profit margin = (Profit / Selling Price) * 100%.We need this to be at least 20%, so:Profit / Selling Price >= 20% => Profit >= 0.20 * Selling Price.But Profit is also equal to Selling Price - Total Cost.So, Selling Price - Total Cost >= 0.20 * Selling Price.Let me write that as an equation:Selling Price - Total Cost >= 0.20 * Selling PriceLet me denote Selling Price as P and Total Cost as C.So, P - C >= 0.20PSubtract 0.20P from both sides:0.80P - C >= 0Which means:0.80P >= CTherefore, P >= C / 0.80So, the minimum selling price P is equal to Total Cost divided by 0.80.We already calculated Total Cost per refrigerator as 1,520.Therefore, P >= 1,520 / 0.80Let me compute that:1,520 / 0.80 = 1,900.So, the minimum selling price per refrigerator should be 1,900.Wait, let me verify this.If they sell each refrigerator at 1,900, then their total revenue per month is 50 * 1,900 = 95,000.Total costs are 76,000 as calculated earlier.So, profit is 95,000 - 76,000 = 19,000.Now, profit margin is (Profit / Revenue) * 100% = (19,000 / 95,000) * 100% = 20%.Yes, that checks out.Alternatively, if I calculate it per refrigerator:Selling Price = 1,900.Total Cost = 1,520.Profit per refrigerator = 1,900 - 1,520 = 380.Profit margin per refrigerator = (380 / 1,900) * 100% = 20%.Perfect, that also gives 20%.So, the minimum selling price is 1,900 per refrigerator.But wait, let me think again. Is the 10,000 storefront fee and 5,000 repair cost considered fixed costs? Yes, they are. So, when calculating total cost per refrigerator, we spread those fixed costs over the number of units sold. That's correct.Alternatively, if they sold a different number of units, say, more or less, the cost per refrigerator would change. But since the problem states they sell an average of 50 per month, we can use that number to spread the fixed costs.So, I think my calculation is correct.Therefore, the minimum selling price is 1,900 per refrigerator.**Final Answer**The minimum selling price for each small refrigerator is boxed{1900} dollars."},{"question":"Given complex numbers ( z_{1} ) and ( z_{2} ) on the complex plane corresponding to points ( A ) and ( B ) respectively, where ( left|z_{1}right| = 4 ) and ( 4 z_{1}^{2} - 2 z_{1} z_{2} + z_{2}^{2} = 0 ).

The given information is that ( |z_1| = 4 ) and ( 4z_1^2 - 2z_1z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). I need to find the area of triangle OAB, where O is the origin. The options are given as (A) ( 8sqrt{3} ), (B) ( 4sqrt{3} ), (C) ( 6sqrt{3} ), and (D) ( 12sqrt{3} ).First, I should recall that in the complex plane, a complex number can be represented as a point with coordinates, so ( z_1 = x_1 + y_1i ) and ( z_2 = x_2 + y_2i ). The modulus ( |z_1| = 4 ) means that the distance from the origin to point A is 4, so point A lies somewhere on a circle with radius 4 centered at the origin.Now, the equation given is ( 4z_1^2 - 2z_1z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation in terms of ( z_2 ). Maybe I can solve for ( z_2 ) in terms of ( z_1 ). Let me try that.Let me rewrite the equation:( 4z_1^2 - 2z_1z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 )This is a quadratic in ( z_2 ). Let me denote ( z_2 ) as the variable:( z_2^2 - 2z_1z_2 + 4z_1^2 = 0 )Wait, actually, the original equation is ( 4z_1^2 - 2z_1z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ), which can be rearranged as:( z_2^2 - 2z_1z_2 + 4z_1^2 = 0 )Yes, that's correct. So, it's a quadratic equation in ( z_2 ). Let's solve for ( z_2 ) using the quadratic formula.The quadratic is ( z_2^2 - 2z_1z_2 + 4z_1^2 = 0 ). So, the coefficients are:- ( a = 1 )- ( b = -2z_1 )- ( c = 4z_1^2 )Applying the quadratic formula:( z_2 = frac{2z_1 pm sqrt{( -2z_1 )^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 4z_1^2}}{2 cdot 1} )Simplify the discriminant:( ( -2z_1 )^2 = 4z_1^2 )( 4 cdot 1 cdot 4z_1^2 = 16z_1^2 )So, discriminant is ( 4z_1^2 - 16z_1^2 = -12z_1^2 )Therefore,( z_2 = frac{2z_1 pm sqrt{ -12z_1^2 }}{2} )Simplify the square root:( sqrt{ -12z_1^2 } = sqrt{12} cdot sqrt{ -1 } cdot sqrt{z_1^2} = 2sqrt{3}i |z_1| )But wait, ( sqrt{z_1^2} ) is not exactly ( |z_1| ), because ( z_1 ) is a complex number. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.Alternatively, since ( z_1 ) is a complex number, ( sqrt{z_1^2} ) is just ( z_1 ) or ( -z_1 ). But since we have a square root of a negative number, it's better to factor out the negative sign.So, ( sqrt{ -12z_1^2 } = sqrt{12} cdot sqrt{ -1 } cdot z_1 = 2sqrt{3}i z_1 )Wait, but actually, ( sqrt{z_1^2} ) is not necessarily ( z_1 ). It can be ( z_1 ) or ( -z_1 ). Hmm, but in the context of square roots in complex numbers, it's a bit more involved. Maybe I should approach this differently.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the quadratic equation.Looking at ( z_2^2 - 2z_1z_2 + 4z_1^2 = 0 ), I wonder if it can be factored. Let me see:It looks similar to ( (z_2 - z_1)^2 = 0 ), but that would give ( z_2^2 - 2z_1z_2 + z_1^2 = 0 ). Our equation has ( 4z_1^2 ) instead of ( z_1^2 ). So, perhaps it's a different factor.Alternatively, maybe ( (z_2 - a z_1)^2 = 0 ) for some a. Let me try:( (z_2 - a z_1)^2 = z_2^2 - 2a z_1 z_2 + a^2 z_1^2 )Comparing to our equation ( z_2^2 - 2z_1 z_2 + 4 z_1^2 ), we have:- Coefficient of ( z_2^2 ): 1, which matches.- Coefficient of ( z_1 z_2 ): -2a vs. -2, so a = 1.- Constant term: ( a^2 z_1^2 ) vs. 4 z_1^2, so ( a^2 = 4 ), which would mean a = 2 or a = -2.But wait, if a = 1, then the constant term would be ( z_1^2 ), but in our equation, it's 4 z_1^2. So, that approach doesn't directly work.Alternatively, maybe the quadratic can be written as ( (z_2 - z_1)^2 + 3 z_1^2 = 0 ). Let's check:( (z_2 - z_1)^2 = z_2^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_1^2 )Adding ( 3 z_1^2 ) gives ( z_2^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + 4 z_1^2 ), which is exactly our equation. So, we have:( (z_2 - z_1)^2 + 3 z_1^2 = 0 )Therefore,( (z_2 - z_1)^2 = -3 z_1^2 )Taking square roots on both sides:( z_2 - z_1 = pm sqrt{ -3 } z_1 = pm i sqrt{3} z_1 )Therefore,( z_2 = z_1 pm i sqrt{3} z_1 = z_1 (1 pm i sqrt{3}) )So, ( z_2 = z_1 (1 + i sqrt{3}) ) or ( z_2 = z_1 (1 - i sqrt{3}) )Okay, so ( z_2 ) is ( z_1 ) multiplied by ( 1 pm i sqrt{3} ). Let me compute the modulus of ( z_2 ).First, compute ( |1 pm i sqrt{3}| ). The modulus is ( sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2 ).Therefore, ( |z_2| = |z_1| cdot |1 pm i sqrt{3}| = 4 times 2 = 8 ). So, ( |z_2| = 8 ).So, point B is at a distance of 8 from the origin.Now, to find the area of triangle OAB, where O is the origin, A is ( z_1 ), and B is ( z_2 ). The area can be found using the formula:( text{Area} = frac{1}{2} | text{Im}(z_1 overline{z_2}) | )Alternatively, since we know the lengths of OA and OB, and the angle between them, the area can also be calculated as:( text{Area} = frac{1}{2} |OA| |OB| sin theta )where ( theta ) is the angle between OA and OB.So, if I can find the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ), then I can compute the area.Given that ( z_2 = z_1 (1 pm i sqrt{3}) ), the argument of ( z_2 ) is the argument of ( z_1 ) plus the argument of ( 1 pm i sqrt{3} ).Let me compute the argument of ( 1 + i sqrt{3} ). The argument is ( tan^{-1} left( frac{sqrt{3}}{1} right) = frac{pi}{3} ). Similarly, the argument of ( 1 - i sqrt{3} ) is ( -frac{pi}{3} ).So, if ( z_2 = z_1 (1 + i sqrt{3}) ), then the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is ( frac{pi}{3} ). Similarly, if ( z_2 = z_1 (1 - i sqrt{3}) ), the angle is ( -frac{pi}{3} ), but since angles are periodic, it's equivalent to ( frac{5pi}{3} ), but the sine of the angle will be the same in magnitude.Therefore, the angle between OA and OB is ( frac{pi}{3} ).So, the area is:( frac{1}{2} times |OA| times |OB| times sin theta = frac{1}{2} times 4 times 8 times sin left( frac{pi}{3} right) )Compute this:First, ( sin left( frac{pi}{3} right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} )So,( frac{1}{2} times 4 times 8 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} )Simplify step by step:- ( frac{1}{2} times 4 = 2 )- ( 2 times 8 = 16 )- ( 16 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 8 sqrt{3} )Wait, but 8√3 is option A. But let me double-check because sometimes the angle between vectors is not just the difference in their arguments but the actual angle between them.Wait, actually, in this case, since ( z_2 ) is ( z_1 ) multiplied by a complex number with argument ( pm frac{pi}{3} ), the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is indeed ( frac{pi}{3} ). So, the sine of that angle is ( sqrt{3}/2 ), so the area should be 8√3.But hold on, let me think again. The formula is ( frac{1}{2}ab sin theta ), where a and b are the lengths, and theta is the angle between them.Here, a is |OA| = 4, b is |OB| = 8, theta is 60 degrees or pi/3 radians.So, 1/2 * 4 * 8 * sin(pi/3) = 1/2 * 32 * (√3 / 2) = 16 * (√3 / 2) = 8√3.So, that would be 8√3, which is option A.But wait, hold on, the options have 8√3 as A, 4√3 as B, etc. But I want to make sure that the angle between OA and OB is indeed 60 degrees.Alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors to compute the area.Let me represent ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) as vectors from the origin. Then, the area of triangle OAB is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors OA and OB.In complex numbers, the cross product magnitude is given by the absolute value of the imaginary part of ( z_1 overline{z_2} ).So, let's compute ( z_1 overline{z_2} ).Given that ( z_2 = z_1 (1 pm i sqrt{3}) ), then ( overline{z_2} = overline{z_1} (1 mp i sqrt{3}) ).Therefore,( z_1 overline{z_2} = z_1 cdot overline{z_1} (1 mp i sqrt{3}) = |z_1|^2 (1 mp i sqrt{3}) = 16 (1 mp i sqrt{3}) )The imaginary part of this is ( mp 16 sqrt{3} ). The absolute value is ( 16 sqrt{3} ).Therefore, the area is ( frac{1}{2} times 16 sqrt{3} = 8 sqrt{3} ), which is option A.But wait, the options include 8√3 as A, which seems correct based on this calculation. However, I have a doubt because sometimes when you have complex numbers multiplied by a scalar, the angle might be different.Wait, let me think again. If ( z_2 = z_1 (1 + i sqrt{3}) ), then the ratio ( frac{z_2}{z_1} = 1 + i sqrt{3} ), which has a modulus of 2 and an argument of 60 degrees. So, this means that ( z_2 ) is ( z_1 ) scaled by 2 and rotated by 60 degrees. Therefore, the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is 60 degrees.Therefore, the area is 1/2 * |z1| * |z2| * sin(theta) = 1/2 * 4 * 8 * sin(60) = 16 * (√3 / 2) = 8√3.So, that seems consistent.But wait, the answer choices have 8√3 as option A, but I recall sometimes in these problems, depending on the orientation, the area might be different. But in this case, since we're taking the absolute value of the imaginary part, it should be positive regardless.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the angle. Let me think.If ( z_2 = z_1 (1 + i sqrt{3}) ), then the argument of ( z_2 ) is the argument of ( z_1 ) plus 60 degrees. So, the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is 60 degrees. Therefore, the area is 8√3.But wait, let me check with coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) and compute the area.Let me let ( z_1 = 4 ) (on the real axis for simplicity). Then, ( z_2 = 4 (1 + i sqrt{3}) = 4 + 4i sqrt{3} ).So, point A is (4, 0), point B is (4, 4√3). Then, the area of triangle OAB can be found using the determinant formula:Area = 1/2 |x1 y2 - x2 y1|Here, O is (0,0), A is (4,0), B is (4,4√3).So, plugging into the formula:Area = 1/2 |4 * 4√3 - 4 * 0| = 1/2 |16√3| = 8√3.Yes, that's consistent. So, the area is indeed 8√3, which is option A.Wait, but hold on, the problem didn't specify whether the points are in a particular orientation, but in my example, I placed ( z_1 ) on the real axis. But in general, ( z_1 ) can be anywhere on the circle of radius 4. However, because the ratio ( z_2 / z_1 ) is fixed, the angle between them is fixed, so regardless of where ( z_1 ) is, the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is 60 degrees, so the area remains the same.Therefore, the area is 8√3, which is option A.But wait, hold on, in the problem statement, the equation is ( 4z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). When I solved it, I got ( z_2 = z_1 (1 pm i sqrt{3}) ). So, that gives two possibilities for ( z_2 ), one at +60 degrees and one at -60 degrees relative to ( z_1 ).But in either case, the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is 60 degrees, so the area remains the same.Therefore, I think the answer is 8√3, which is option A.Wait, but hold on, I just realized that in my initial quadratic equation, I might have made a mistake in the sign.Wait, the original equation is ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). When I rearranged it, I wrote it as ( z_2^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + 4 z_1^2 = 0 ). Is that correct?Yes, because moving all terms to one side:( z_2^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + 4 z_1^2 = 0 )Yes, that's correct.So, solving for ( z_2 ), we get ( z_2 = z_1 (1 pm i sqrt{3}) ), which is correct.Therefore, the modulus of ( z_2 ) is 8, as I found earlier, and the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is 60 degrees, leading to the area of 8√3.But wait, hold on, in the problem statement, it's ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). If I factor this equation, maybe I can see it differently.Let me try to factor ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 ).Hmm, perhaps as ( (2 z_1 - z_2)^2 ). Let me check:( (2 z_1 - z_2)^2 = 4 z_1^2 - 4 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 ). But our equation is ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 ). So, it's not quite the same.Alternatively, maybe ( (z_2 - z_1)^2 + 3 z_1^2 = 0 ), as I did earlier, which led to ( z_2 = z_1 (1 pm i sqrt{3}) ). So, that seems correct.Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be written as ( (2 z_1 - z_2)^2 = 3 z_1^2 ). Let me check:( (2 z_1 - z_2)^2 = 4 z_1^2 - 4 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 ). If I set this equal to ( 3 z_1^2 ), then:( 4 z_1^2 - 4 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 3 z_1^2 )Which simplifies to:( z_1^2 - 4 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 )But our original equation is ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). So, that's different.Therefore, my initial approach was correct in solving the quadratic equation.So, I think my conclusion is correct: the area is 8√3, which is option A.But wait, hold on, in the problem statement, it's ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). If I divide both sides by ( z_1^2 ), assuming ( z_1 neq 0 ), which it isn't because |z1| = 4.So, dividing by ( z_1^2 ):( 4 - 2 frac{z_2}{z_1} + left( frac{z_2}{z_1} right)^2 = 0 )Let me denote ( w = frac{z_2}{z_1} ). Then, the equation becomes:( w^2 - 2 w + 4 = 0 )Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Wait, no:Wait, if I divide the original equation by ( z_1^2 ):( 4 - 2 frac{z_2}{z_1} + left( frac{z_2}{z_1} right)^2 = 0 )So, ( w^2 - 2 w + 4 = 0 ). Wait, that's different from earlier.Wait, earlier, when I rearranged the equation, I got ( z_2^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + 4 z_1^2 = 0 ), which led to ( w^2 - 2 w + 4 = 0 ). So, same thing.So, solving for w:( w = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 - 16}}{2} = frac{2 pm sqrt{-12}}{2} = 1 pm i sqrt{3} )So, ( w = 1 pm i sqrt{3} ), which is consistent with earlier.Therefore, ( frac{z_2}{z_1} = 1 pm i sqrt{3} ), so ( z_2 = z_1 (1 pm i sqrt{3}) ). So, modulus of ( z_2 ) is 8, as before.So, the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is 60 degrees, leading to the area of 8√3.Therefore, I think the correct answer is A, 8√3.But wait, the options have A as 8√3, which is what I got, but I just want to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the angle.Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 120 degrees instead of 60 degrees. Let me check.If ( frac{z_2}{z_1} = 1 + i sqrt{3} ), then the argument is 60 degrees, so the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is 60 degrees.But if ( frac{z_2}{z_1} = 1 - i sqrt{3} ), then the argument is -60 degrees, which is equivalent to 300 degrees, but the angle between ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) is still 60 degrees because angles are measured as the smallest angle between the two vectors.Therefore, regardless of the sign, the angle between them is 60 degrees.Therefore, the area is 8√3, which is option A.But wait, hold on, in my earlier calculation when I set ( z_1 = 4 ) on the real axis, ( z_2 = 4 + 4i sqrt{3} ), which is at 60 degrees from the real axis, so the angle between OA and OB is 60 degrees, so the area is 8√3.Therefore, I think I'm confident that the answer is A, 8√3.Wait, but hold on, the problem is given as ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). Let me plug in ( z_2 = z_1 (1 + i sqrt{3}) ) to verify.Compute ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 ):= ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 (z_1 (1 + i sqrt{3})) + (z_1 (1 + i sqrt{3}))^2 )= ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1^2 (1 + i sqrt{3}) + z_1^2 (1 + i sqrt{3})^2 )Compute each term:First term: ( 4 z_1^2 )Second term: ( -2 z_1^2 (1 + i sqrt{3}) = -2 z_1^2 - 2 i sqrt{3} z_1^2 )Third term: ( z_1^2 (1 + 2 i sqrt{3} - 3) = z_1^2 (-2 + 2 i sqrt{3}) )So, adding all terms:4 z1² -2 z1² -2 i√3 z1² -2 z1² + 2 i√3 z1²Simplify:(4 - 2 - 2) z1² + (-2 i√3 + 2 i√3) z1²= 0 z1² + 0 z1² = 0So, yes, it satisfies the equation. Therefore, my solution is correct.Therefore, the area is 8√3, which is option A.But wait, hold on, the problem says \\"the area of triangle OAB\\". In my coordinate example, when ( z_1 = 4 ) and ( z_2 = 4 + 4i√3 ), the area is 8√3. But in another case, if ( z_1 ) is somewhere else, say at an angle θ, then ( z_2 ) would be at θ ± 60 degrees, but the area would still be the same because the angle between them is fixed.Therefore, regardless of the position of ( z_1 ) on the circle of radius 4, the area remains 8√3.Therefore, the answer is A, 8√3.Wait, but hold on, I just realized that in my coordinate example, point B is at (4, 4√3), which is 8 units from the origin, as |z2| = 8. So, the triangle OAB has vertices at (0,0), (4,0), and (4,4√3). The area is 8√3, which is correct.But wait, another way to compute the area is using the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle: ( frac{1}{2}ab sin C ). Here, a = 4, b = 8, and C = 60 degrees, so ( sin 60 = sqrt{3}/2 ). Therefore, area = ( frac{1}{2} times 4 times 8 times sqrt{3}/2 = 8√3 ). So, that's consistent.Therefore, I think I'm confident that the answer is A, 8√3.But wait, hold on, the problem is given as ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). Let me think if there's another way to interpret this equation.Alternatively, perhaps it's a quadratic in ( z_1 ). Let me try that.Rewriting the equation:( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 )This can be considered as a quadratic in ( z_1 ):( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_2 z_1 + z_2^2 = 0 )Solving for ( z_1 ):Using quadratic formula:( z_1 = frac{2 z_2 pm sqrt{(2 z_2)^2 - 4 times 4 times z_2^2}}{2 times 4} )Simplify discriminant:( (2 z_2)^2 - 16 z_2^2 = 4 z_2^2 - 16 z_2^2 = -12 z_2^2 )Therefore,( z_1 = frac{2 z_2 pm sqrt{ -12 z_2^2 }}{8} = frac{2 z_2 pm 2 i sqrt{3} z_2 }{8} = frac{z_2 (1 pm i sqrt{3})}{4} )Therefore,( z_1 = frac{z_2 (1 pm i sqrt{3})}{4} )But since ( |z_1| = 4 ), we can compute |z2|:( |z_1| = left| frac{z_2 (1 pm i sqrt{3})}{4} right| = frac{|z_2| times 2}{4} = frac{|z_2|}{2} )Given that |z1| = 4, then:( frac{|z_2|}{2} = 4 implies |z_2| = 8 )Which is consistent with earlier findings.So, regardless of solving for ( z_2 ) or ( z_1 ), we get the same relationship between their moduli and the angle between them.Therefore, the area is 8√3, which is option A.But wait, hold on, in the problem statement, it's ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). Let me think if this can be represented as a vector equation.Alternatively, perhaps using vectors, ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) can be considered as vectors, and the equation is ( 4 z_1^2 - 2 z_1 z_2 + z_2^2 = 0 ). But in vector terms, this is not straightforward because it's a quadratic equation involving the product of complex numbers.Alternatively, perhaps using inner and outer products, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, perhaps using the law of cosines. Since we have triangle OAB, with sides OA = 4, OB = 8, and AB can be found using the distance formula.Wait, but we don't know AB, but we can find the angle between OA and OB, which is 60 degrees, as we found earlier.Therefore, the area is 8√3, as before.Therefore, I think I've verified it multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is A, 8√3.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"In the country of Anchuria, a unified state exam takes place. The probability of guessing the correct answer to each question on the exam is 0.25. In 2011, to receive a certificate, one needed to answer correctly 3 questions out of 20. In 2012, the School Management of Anchuria decided that 3 questions were too few. Now, one needs to correctly answer 6 questions out of 40. The question is, if one knows nothing and simply guesses the answers, in which year is the probability of receiving an Anchurian certificate higher - in 2011 or in 2012?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the probability of passing an exam by guessing in two different years, 2011 and 2012. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, in 2011, the exam required answering 3 out of 20 questions correctly. Each question has a 0.25 chance of being answered correctly by guessing. In 2012, the requirement changed to answering 6 out of 40 questions correctly. I need to find out in which year the probability of passing by guessing is higher.Hmm, so this sounds like a binomial probability problem. The binomial distribution gives the probability of having exactly k successes in n independent trials, with the probability of success on a single trial being p. The formula is:P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)Where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.But wait, actually, in this case, we don't need exactly 3 or exactly 6 correct answers. We need at least 3 in 2011 and at least 6 in 2012. So, the probability of passing is the sum of probabilities from k=3 to k=20 in 2011 and from k=6 to k=40 in 2012.Calculating all these probabilities individually would be tedious, especially for 2012 with 40 questions. Maybe there's a smarter way to approximate or compare these probabilities without computing each term.Alternatively, I remember that for binomial distributions, when n is large and p is not too close to 0 or 1, we can approximate using the normal distribution. Maybe that can help here.Let me recall the conditions for normal approximation: np and n(1-p) should both be greater than 5. Let's check for both years.In 2011: n=20, p=0.25. So np=5 and n(1-p)=15. Hmm, np is exactly 5. Some sources say np and n(1-p) should be at least 5 or 10. Maybe 5 is a bit low, but perhaps it's still okay. For 2012: n=40, p=0.25. So np=10 and n(1-p)=30. That's definitely good for normal approximation.So, maybe I can use the normal approximation for both, but I should be cautious with 2011 since np=5 is on the lower side.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the exact probabilities for 2011 and approximate for 2012.Wait, 2011: 20 questions, 3 correct. The exact probability can be calculated using the binomial formula, but it would involve summing from k=3 to k=20. That's 18 terms, which is a bit much, but maybe manageable.Similarly, for 2012, 40 questions, 6 correct. That would be 35 terms, which is a lot. So, perhaps using the normal approximation is better for 2012.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the cumulative probabilities using some other method or look for a pattern.Wait, another thought: since both exams have the same p=0.25, but different n and k. Maybe I can compare the required number of correct answers relative to the expected number.In 2011, the expected number of correct answers is np=20*0.25=5. So, needing 3 correct is below the mean. In 2012, expected is 40*0.25=10, so needing 6 correct is also below the mean.So, in both cases, the required number is below the expected value. So, the probability of getting at least that number is more than 0.5? Wait, no, because the distribution is not symmetric. Wait, actually, no, in a binomial distribution, the probability of being above the mean is not necessarily 0.5 unless it's symmetric.Wait, actually, for a binomial distribution, the probability of being above the mean is not necessarily 0.5. It depends on p. For p=0.5, it's symmetric, but for p≠0.5, it's skewed.In our case, p=0.25, which is less than 0.5, so the distribution is skewed to the right. So, the probability of being above the mean is less than 0.5, and below the mean is more than 0.5.Wait, no, actually, the mean is μ=np. For p=0.25, the distribution is skewed to the right, meaning the tail is on the right side. So, the probability of getting more than μ is less than 0.5, and less than μ is more than 0.5.But in our case, in 2011, we need at least 3, which is below μ=5. So, the probability should be more than 0.5. In 2012, we need at least 6, which is also below μ=10, so probability more than 0.5.But we need to compare which is higher: the probability of getting at least 3 out of 20, or at least 6 out of 40, with p=0.25.Alternatively, maybe we can compute the exact probability for 2011 and approximate for 2012.Let me try to compute the exact probability for 2011 first.In 2011: n=20, p=0.25, k=3.We need P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2).So, let's compute P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2).P(X=k) = C(20, k)*(0.25)^k*(0.75)^(20 - k)Compute each term:P(X=0) = C(20,0)*(0.25)^0*(0.75)^20 = 1*1*(0.75)^20Similarly,P(X=1) = C(20,1)*(0.25)^1*(0.75)^19 = 20*(0.25)*(0.75)^19P(X=2) = C(20,2)*(0.25)^2*(0.75)^18 = 190*(0.0625)*(0.75)^18Let me compute each term numerically.First, compute (0.75)^20:(0.75)^20. Let's compute step by step.(0.75)^2 = 0.5625(0.75)^4 = (0.5625)^2 ≈ 0.31640625(0.75)^8 ≈ (0.31640625)^2 ≈ 0.099975585(0.75)^16 ≈ (0.099975585)^2 ≈ 0.009995117Then, (0.75)^20 = (0.75)^16 * (0.75)^4 ≈ 0.009995117 * 0.31640625 ≈ 0.0031640625Wait, that seems too low. Let me check with a calculator.Alternatively, I can use logarithms or approximate.But maybe it's easier to use the fact that ln(0.75) ≈ -0.28768207.So, ln((0.75)^20) = 20*(-0.28768207) ≈ -5.7536414Exponentiate: e^(-5.7536414) ≈ 0.003164.Yes, so (0.75)^20 ≈ 0.003164.Similarly, (0.75)^19 = (0.75)^20 / 0.75 ≈ 0.003164 / 0.75 ≈ 0.004219.(0.75)^18 = (0.75)^19 / 0.75 ≈ 0.004219 / 0.75 ≈ 0.005625.Wait, let me verify:(0.75)^18 = (0.75)^16 * (0.75)^2 ≈ 0.009995117 * 0.5625 ≈ 0.005624999 ≈ 0.005625.Yes, that's correct.So, now compute each term:P(X=0) = 1 * 1 * 0.003164 ≈ 0.003164P(X=1) = 20 * 0.25 * 0.004219 ≈ 20 * 0.25 * 0.004219 ≈ 5 * 0.004219 ≈ 0.021095P(X=2) = 190 * 0.0625 * 0.005625 ≈ 190 * 0.0003515625 ≈ Let's compute 190 * 0.0003515625:0.0003515625 * 100 = 0.035156250.03515625 * 1.9 = 0.06680625Wait, no, 190 is 100 + 90.So, 100 * 0.0003515625 = 0.0351562590 * 0.0003515625 = 0.03163059375Adding together: 0.03515625 + 0.03163059375 ≈ 0.06678684375So, approximately 0.066787.So, total P(X ≤ 2) ≈ 0.003164 + 0.021095 + 0.066787 ≈ 0.091046Therefore, P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - 0.091046 ≈ 0.908954, or approximately 90.9%.Wow, that's pretty high. So, in 2011, the probability of passing by guessing is about 90.9%.Now, let's move on to 2012.In 2012, n=40, p=0.25, k=6.We need P(X ≥ 6) = 1 - P(X ≤ 5)Calculating P(X ≤ 5) exactly would involve computing P(X=0) through P(X=5), each term being C(40, k)*(0.25)^k*(0.75)^(40 - k). That's a lot of terms, and each term is computationally intensive.Alternatively, since n=40 is large, and np=10, n(1-p)=30, which are both greater than 10, so normal approximation should be quite accurate here.So, let's use the normal approximation for 2012.First, compute the mean and variance.μ = np = 40 * 0.25 = 10σ² = np(1 - p) = 40 * 0.25 * 0.75 = 40 * 0.1875 = 7.5So, σ = sqrt(7.5) ≈ 2.7386We need to find P(X ≥ 6). Using continuity correction, since we're approximating a discrete distribution with a continuous one, we should adjust by 0.5.So, P(X ≥ 6) ≈ P(X ≥ 5.5) in the normal distribution.Compute the z-score:z = (5.5 - μ) / σ = (5.5 - 10) / 2.7386 ≈ (-4.5) / 2.7386 ≈ -1.643Now, find the probability that Z ≥ -1.643.Looking at standard normal distribution tables, P(Z ≥ -1.643) = 1 - P(Z ≤ -1.643). Since the standard normal is symmetric, P(Z ≤ -1.643) = P(Z ≥ 1.643).Looking up z=1.64, the cumulative probability is about 0.9495. For z=1.643, it's slightly higher, maybe around 0.9497.So, P(Z ≥ -1.643) ≈ 1 - 0.0497 ≈ 0.9503, or 95.03%.Wait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, if z is negative, the area to the right is 1 - P(Z ≤ z). So, if z is -1.643, then P(Z ≤ -1.643) ≈ 0.0503, so P(Z ≥ -1.643) ≈ 1 - 0.0503 ≈ 0.9497.Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify:For z = -1.643, the cumulative probability P(Z ≤ -1.643) is the same as 1 - P(Z ≤ 1.643). Since P(Z ≤ 1.643) ≈ 0.9497, then P(Z ≤ -1.643) ≈ 1 - 0.9497 ≈ 0.0503.Therefore, P(Z ≥ -1.643) = 1 - P(Z ≤ -1.643) ≈ 1 - 0.0503 ≈ 0.9497, or 94.97%.So, approximately 95% chance.Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the continuity correction. So, when approximating P(X ≥ 6) for discrete X, we use P(X ≥ 5.5) in the continuous normal distribution.Yes, that's correct.So, z = (5.5 - 10)/2.7386 ≈ (-4.5)/2.7386 ≈ -1.643.Looking up z=-1.643, the area to the left is approximately 0.0503, so the area to the right is 1 - 0.0503 ≈ 0.9497.So, the probability is approximately 94.97%.Wait, but in 2011, the probability was approximately 90.9%, and in 2012, it's approximately 94.97%. So, 2012 has a higher probability?But that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer twice as many questions correctly, but the total number of questions is also doubled. So, the proportion required is the same: 15% in 2011 (3/20=0.15) and 15% in 2012 (6/40=0.15). So, the proportion is the same, but the number of trials is higher.But the probability of getting at least 15% correct is higher in 2012? That seems odd because with more questions, the distribution might be more concentrated around the mean, so the probability of being below a certain proportion might decrease.Wait, but in 2011, the mean is 5, and we're requiring 3, which is 60% of the mean. In 2012, the mean is 10, and we're requiring 6, which is 60% of the mean as well. So, in both cases, we're requiring 60% of the mean.But wait, the variance in 2012 is higher because n is larger, but the standard deviation is sqrt(np(1-p)) which is sqrt(7.5) ≈ 2.7386, whereas in 2011, σ = sqrt(20*0.25*0.75) = sqrt(3.75) ≈ 1.9365.So, in 2012, the standard deviation is higher, but the required number is also higher in absolute terms.Wait, but in terms of z-scores, in 2011, the z-score for 3 correct answers would be (3 - 5)/1.9365 ≈ (-2)/1.9365 ≈ -1.033.In 2012, the z-score for 6 correct answers is (6 - 10)/2.7386 ≈ (-4)/2.7386 ≈ -1.461.Wait, but in 2011, we were calculating P(X ≥ 3), which corresponds to P(Z ≥ -1.033). In 2012, P(X ≥ 6) corresponds to P(Z ≥ -1.461).Wait, but in 2011, the z-score was -1.033, so the area to the right is 1 - P(Z ≤ -1.033). P(Z ≤ -1.033) is approximately 0.15, so 1 - 0.15 = 0.85, but earlier we calculated 90.9% using exact binomial. Hmm, discrepancy here.Wait, maybe I confused something.Wait, in 2011, we used exact binomial and got 90.9%. If I use normal approximation, with continuity correction:P(X ≥ 3) ≈ P(X ≥ 2.5) in normal.So, z = (2.5 - 5)/1.9365 ≈ (-2.5)/1.9365 ≈ -1.291.Looking up z=-1.291, P(Z ≤ -1.291) ≈ 0.0985, so P(Z ≥ -1.291) ≈ 1 - 0.0985 ≈ 0.9015, which is about 90.15%, which is close to the exact 90.9%. So, that makes sense.Similarly, in 2012, with continuity correction, P(X ≥ 6) ≈ P(X ≥ 5.5), which gave us z ≈ -1.643, leading to P ≈ 94.97%.But wait, in 2011, the exact probability was 90.9%, and the normal approximation gave 90.15%, which is pretty close.In 2012, the normal approximation gives 94.97%, which would be higher than 2011's 90.9%.But wait, that seems contradictory because in 2012, the number of questions is higher, but the proportion required is the same.Wait, perhaps because the number of trials is higher, the distribution is more spread out, so the probability of being above a certain lower bound is higher? Or is it the other way around?Wait, actually, when n increases, the distribution becomes more concentrated around the mean, so the probability of being far below the mean decreases, but in our case, the required number is proportionally the same distance from the mean in both years.Wait, in 2011, the mean is 5, required is 3, which is 2 below the mean.In 2012, the mean is 10, required is 6, which is 4 below the mean.So, in terms of standard deviations:In 2011, 3 is (5 - 3)/1.9365 ≈ 1.03 standard deviations below the mean.In 2012, 6 is (10 - 6)/2.7386 ≈ 1.46 standard deviations below the mean.So, in 2011, the required score is closer to the mean in terms of standard deviations, so the probability should be higher. But according to our calculations, 2012 has a higher probability.Wait, that contradicts the intuition. So, maybe my calculations are wrong.Wait, in 2011, the exact probability was 90.9%, and in 2012, it's approximately 95%. So, 2012 is higher.But why? Because even though the required number is further below the mean in terms of standard deviations, the total number of trials is higher, so the distribution is more spread out, but the probability of being above a certain lower bound is higher.Wait, no, actually, when n increases, the distribution becomes more concentrated around the mean, so the probability of being far below the mean decreases. But in our case, the required number is proportionally the same distance from the mean in terms of the actual number of correct answers, but in terms of standard deviations, it's further away in 2012.Wait, so in 2011, 3 is 1.03σ below the mean, and in 2012, 6 is 1.46σ below the mean.So, 2012's required score is further from the mean in terms of σ, so the probability should be lower, but our calculation says higher.Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I messed up the direction.Wait, in 2011, the z-score was -1.03, so the area to the right is 1 - Φ(-1.03) = Φ(1.03) ≈ 0.8485, but wait, no, Φ(-1.03) is the area to the left, so 1 - Φ(-1.03) is the area to the right, which is Φ(1.03) ≈ 0.8485. But in reality, the exact probability was 90.9%, so the normal approximation was underestimating.Wait, no, in 2011, the exact probability was 90.9%, and the normal approximation gave us 90.15%, which is close.In 2012, the exact probability would be higher than the normal approximation? Or lower?Wait, actually, the exact probability for 2012 would require summing from k=6 to 40, which is tedious, but perhaps we can compute it using the binomial formula in parts.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Poisson approximation, but since np=10, which is large, Poisson isn't suitable.Alternatively, maybe I can use the De Moivre-Laplace theorem, which is the normal approximation, but perhaps I made a mistake in the continuity correction.Wait, in 2012, P(X ≥ 6) ≈ P(X ≥ 5.5). So, z = (5.5 - 10)/2.7386 ≈ -1.643.Looking up z=-1.643, the cumulative probability is approximately 0.0503, so the area to the right is 1 - 0.0503 ≈ 0.9497.So, approximately 94.97%.But in 2011, the exact probability was 90.9%, so 2012 is higher.But that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly, but the total number is also higher. So, the proportion is the same, but the absolute number is higher.Wait, but in terms of the distribution, with more questions, the variance is higher, so the spread is larger, making it easier to be above a certain lower bound.Wait, actually, no. Higher variance means more spread out, so the probability of being above a certain lower bound might be higher or lower depending on where the bound is.Wait, in 2011, the required number is closer to the mean in terms of standard deviations, so it's easier to achieve, hence higher probability.But according to our calculations, 2012 has a higher probability, which contradicts that.Wait, maybe my intuition is wrong.Wait, let's think differently. The probability of getting at least k correct answers is the same as 1 minus the probability of getting less than k.So, in 2011, it's 1 - P(X ≤ 2), and in 2012, it's 1 - P(X ≤ 5).So, if P(X ≤ 2) in 2011 is 0.091, and P(X ≤ 5) in 2012 is, let's see, if the normal approximation gives P(X ≤ 5.5) ≈ 0.0503, then 1 - 0.0503 ≈ 0.9497.But wait, in 2011, P(X ≤ 2) ≈ 0.091, so 1 - 0.091 ≈ 0.909.In 2012, P(X ≤ 5) would be less than P(X ≤ 5.5), which is 0.0503, so P(X ≤ 5) is less than 0.0503, maybe around 0.048 or something.Therefore, 1 - P(X ≤ 5) would be higher than 0.95.Wait, but in 2011, 1 - P(X ≤ 2) ≈ 0.909, and in 2012, 1 - P(X ≤ 5) ≈ 0.952.So, 2012 is higher.But that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly, but the total number is higher.Wait, maybe it's because the required number is a smaller proportion of the total in 2012? Wait, no, 3/20=0.15, and 6/40=0.15, same proportion.Wait, but in 2012, the number of trials is higher, so the variance is higher, making the distribution more spread out, so the probability of being above a certain lower bound is higher.Wait, actually, no, higher variance would mean more spread out, so the probability of being above a lower bound might be higher or lower depending on where the bound is.Wait, in 2011, the required number is 3, which is 60% of the mean (5). In 2012, 6 is 60% of the mean (10). So, proportionally, it's the same.But in 2011, the standard deviation is smaller, so 3 is closer to the mean in terms of standard deviations, making it easier to achieve, hence higher probability.Wait, but according to our calculations, 2012 has a higher probability.Wait, maybe I'm confusing the direction. Let me think again.In 2011, the z-score for 3 correct answers is (3 - 5)/1.9365 ≈ -1.033, so the area to the right is about 84.85% (since Φ(1.03) ≈ 0.8485). But the exact probability was 90.9%, which is higher.In 2012, the z-score for 6 correct answers is (6 - 10)/2.7386 ≈ -1.461, so the area to the right is about 92.79% (since Φ(1.46) ≈ 0.9279). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 94.97%, but that was with continuity correction.Wait, maybe I confused the continuity correction.Wait, in 2012, P(X ≥ 6) ≈ P(X ≥ 5.5) in normal, which is z = (5.5 - 10)/2.7386 ≈ -1.643, leading to P ≈ 94.97%.But without continuity correction, P(X ≥ 6) ≈ P(X ≥ 6) in normal, which is z = (6 - 10)/2.7386 ≈ -1.461, leading to P ≈ 92.79%.But which one is correct?Well, continuity correction is supposed to give a better approximation, so 94.97% is more accurate.But in 2011, without continuity correction, z = (3 - 5)/1.9365 ≈ -1.033, P ≈ 84.85%, but with continuity correction, z = (2.5 - 5)/1.9365 ≈ -1.291, P ≈ 90.15%, which is closer to the exact 90.9%.So, in 2012, with continuity correction, we get 94.97%, which is higher than 2011's 90.9%.Therefore, according to this, the probability is higher in 2012.But that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly, but the total number is also higher.Wait, but the proportion is the same: 15% in both years.Wait, maybe because in 2012, the number of questions is higher, the probability of getting exactly 6 is higher, but the cumulative probability from 6 to 40 is higher than from 3 to 20.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should compute the exact probability for 2012 as well.But computing P(X ≥ 6) for n=40, p=0.25 is time-consuming. Maybe I can use the complement and compute P(X ≤ 5).Alternatively, use the binomial formula for each term from k=0 to 5 and sum them up.Let me try that.Compute P(X=0): C(40,0)*(0.25)^0*(0.75)^40 = 1*1*(0.75)^40.Compute (0.75)^40. Let's compute it step by step.(0.75)^2 = 0.5625(0.75)^4 = (0.5625)^2 ≈ 0.31640625(0.75)^8 ≈ (0.31640625)^2 ≈ 0.099975585(0.75)^16 ≈ (0.099975585)^2 ≈ 0.009995117(0.75)^32 ≈ (0.009995117)^2 ≈ 0.0000999023Now, (0.75)^40 = (0.75)^32 * (0.75)^8 ≈ 0.0000999023 * 0.099975585 ≈ 0.000009987.So, P(X=0) ≈ 0.000009987 ≈ 0.00001.P(X=1): C(40,1)*(0.25)^1*(0.75)^39.C(40,1)=40.(0.25)^1=0.25.(0.75)^39 = (0.75)^40 / 0.75 ≈ 0.000009987 / 0.75 ≈ 0.000013316.So, P(X=1) ≈ 40 * 0.25 * 0.000013316 ≈ 40 * 0.000003329 ≈ 0.00013316.P(X=2): C(40,2)*(0.25)^2*(0.75)^38.C(40,2)=780.(0.25)^2=0.0625.(0.75)^38 = (0.75)^40 / (0.75)^2 ≈ 0.000009987 / 0.5625 ≈ 0.000017748.So, P(X=2) ≈ 780 * 0.0625 * 0.000017748 ≈ 780 * 0.000001109 ≈ 0.000866.P(X=3): C(40,3)*(0.25)^3*(0.75)^37.C(40,3)=9880.(0.25)^3=0.015625.(0.75)^37 = (0.75)^40 / (0.75)^3 ≈ 0.000009987 / 0.421875 ≈ 0.00002367.So, P(X=3) ≈ 9880 * 0.015625 * 0.00002367 ≈ 9880 * 0.000000372 ≈ 0.00368.P(X=4): C(40,4)*(0.25)^4*(0.75)^36.C(40,4)=91390.(0.25)^4=0.00390625.(0.75)^36 = (0.75)^40 / (0.75)^4 ≈ 0.000009987 / 0.31640625 ≈ 0.00003156.So, P(X=4) ≈ 91390 * 0.00390625 * 0.00003156 ≈ 91390 * 0.000000123 ≈ 0.01123.P(X=5): C(40,5)*(0.25)^5*(0.75)^35.C(40,5)=658008.(0.25)^5=0.0009765625.(0.75)^35 = (0.75)^40 / (0.75)^5 ≈ 0.000009987 / 0.2373046875 ≈ 0.00004207.So, P(X=5) ≈ 658008 * 0.0009765625 * 0.00004207 ≈ 658008 * 0.0000000413 ≈ 0.0272.Wait, let me verify these calculations step by step because they might have errors.Starting with P(X=0):(0.75)^40 ≈ 0.000009987, correct.P(X=1):40 * 0.25 * 0.000013316 ≈ 0.00013316, correct.P(X=2):780 * 0.0625 * 0.000017748 ≈ 780 * 0.000001109 ≈ 0.000866, correct.P(X=3):9880 * 0.015625 * 0.00002367 ≈ 9880 * 0.000000372 ≈ 0.00368, correct.P(X=4):91390 * 0.00390625 * 0.00003156 ≈ 91390 * 0.000000123 ≈ 0.01123, correct.P(X=5):658008 * 0.0009765625 * 0.00004207 ≈ 658008 * 0.0000000413 ≈ 0.0272, correct.So, summing up P(X=0) to P(X=5):0.00001 + 0.00013316 + 0.000866 + 0.00368 + 0.01123 + 0.0272 ≈Let's add step by step:Start with 0.00001+ 0.00013316 ≈ 0.00014316+ 0.000866 ≈ 0.00100916+ 0.00368 ≈ 0.00468916+ 0.01123 ≈ 0.01591916+ 0.0272 ≈ 0.04311916So, total P(X ≤ 5) ≈ 0.04311916, or approximately 4.31%.Therefore, P(X ≥ 6) = 1 - 0.04311916 ≈ 0.95688, or approximately 95.69%.Wait, that's higher than the normal approximation with continuity correction, which was 94.97%.So, the exact probability is approximately 95.69%, which is higher than 2011's 90.9%.Therefore, the probability of passing by guessing is higher in 2012.But wait, that seems counterintuitive because in 2012, you have to answer more questions correctly, but the total number is higher. So, the proportion is the same, but the absolute number is higher.But according to the exact calculation, the probability is higher in 2012.Wait, maybe because with more questions, the variance is higher, so the probability of being above a certain lower bound is higher.Wait, but in 2011, the required number is closer to the mean in terms of standard deviations, so it's easier to achieve, hence higher probability.But according to the exact calculation, 2012 has a higher probability.Wait, maybe my intuition was wrong because even though the required number is further from the mean in terms of standard deviations, the higher variance allows for a higher probability of achieving that lower bound.Wait, but in 2011, the required number is 3, which is 2 below the mean of 5, and in 2012, it's 6, which is 4 below the mean of 10.But in terms of standard deviations, 3 is (5 - 3)/1.9365 ≈ 1.03σ below, and 6 is (10 - 6)/2.7386 ≈ 1.46σ below.So, in 2012, the required number is further from the mean in terms of σ, so the probability should be lower, but according to the exact calculation, it's higher.Wait, that seems contradictory.Wait, maybe because in 2012, the distribution is more spread out, so even though the required number is further from the mean in σ terms, the probability of being above that number is higher because the distribution is flatter.Wait, no, actually, the probability of being above a certain lower bound in a more spread out distribution should be higher because the tail is fatter.Wait, but in reality, the probability of being above a certain lower bound depends on how far it is from the mean in terms of σ.Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the direction.Wait, in 2011, the required number is closer to the mean, so the probability is higher.In 2012, the required number is further from the mean, so the probability is lower.But according to the exact calculation, 2012 has a higher probability.Wait, that must mean that my intuition is wrong.Wait, let me think again.In 2011, the probability of getting at least 3 correct is 90.9%.In 2012, the probability of getting at least 6 correct is 95.69%.So, even though in 2012, the required number is further from the mean in terms of σ, the probability is higher.Wait, that seems to suggest that with more questions, the probability of passing by guessing increases, which is counterintuitive.Wait, but in reality, the more questions you have, the more likely you are to get a certain number correct by chance, because the variance increases.Wait, no, actually, the variance increases, but the required number also increases.Wait, in this case, the required number is proportional to the total number of questions.So, in 2011, 3/20=0.15, and in 2012, 6/40=0.15.So, the required proportion is the same.But in 2012, the number of trials is higher, so the distribution is more concentrated around the mean, making it less likely to be far below the mean.Wait, but in our case, the required number is below the mean, so the probability should be higher in 2012 because the distribution is more spread out, making it easier to be above a lower bound.Wait, no, actually, when the distribution is more concentrated around the mean, the probability of being far below the mean decreases.But in our case, the required number is proportionally the same distance from the mean in both years, but in 2012, it's further in terms of σ.Wait, I'm getting confused.Let me think in terms of the exact probabilities.In 2011, P(X ≥ 3) ≈ 90.9%.In 2012, P(X ≥ 6) ≈ 95.69%.So, 2012 has a higher probability.Therefore, the answer is that the probability is higher in 2012.But why?Because even though the required number is further from the mean in terms of σ, the higher number of trials allows for a higher probability of achieving that lower bound.Wait, maybe because the variance is higher, the probability of being above a certain lower bound is higher.Wait, no, higher variance should make the distribution more spread out, so the probability of being above a lower bound should be higher because the tail is fatter.Wait, but in reality, the probability of being above a certain lower bound depends on how far it is from the mean in terms of σ.In 2011, the required number is closer to the mean in terms of σ, so the probability is higher.In 2012, the required number is further from the mean in terms of σ, so the probability is lower.But according to the exact calculation, 2012 has a higher probability.Wait, that must mean that my intuition is wrong.Wait, maybe because the required number is a certain proportion of the total, and with more questions, the probability of achieving that proportion is higher.Wait, but in reality, the probability should decrease because it's harder to get a certain proportion correct when the number of questions increases.Wait, but in our case, the proportion is the same, but the exact probability is higher in 2012.Wait, maybe it's because the variance is higher, so the probability of being above a lower bound is higher.Wait, I'm stuck.But according to the exact calculation, 2012 has a higher probability.So, the answer is that the probability is higher in 2012.Therefore, the probability of receiving an Anchurian certificate by guessing is higher in 2012 than in 2011."},{"question":"Given real numbers ( x, y in (1,+infty) ) such that ( xy - 2x - y + 1 = 0 ), find the minimum value of ( frac{3}{2} x^{2} + y^{2} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of ( frac{3}{2} x^{2} + y^{2} ) given that ( x ) and ( y ) are real numbers greater than 1, and they satisfy the equation ( xy - 2x - y + 1 = 0 ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I think I should work with the given equation to express one variable in terms of the other. That way, I can substitute it into the expression I need to minimize. Let me write down the equation again:( xy - 2x - y + 1 = 0 )Hmm, maybe I can solve for ( y ) in terms of ( x ). Let me try that.Starting with:( xy - 2x - y + 1 = 0 )Let me group the terms with ( y ):( y(x - 1) - 2x + 1 = 0 )So, ( y(x - 1) = 2x - 1 )Therefore, ( y = frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} )Okay, so now I have ( y ) expressed in terms of ( x ). Let me simplify that expression a bit. Maybe I can perform the division:( frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} )Let me see, if I divide 2x - 1 by x - 1, how does that go?Let me write it as:( frac{2x - 2 + 1}{x - 1} = frac{2(x - 1) + 1}{x - 1} = 2 + frac{1}{x - 1} )Oh, that's nice! So, ( y = 2 + frac{1}{x - 1} )Great, so now I can substitute this into the expression I need to minimize:( frac{3}{2} x^{2} + y^{2} )Substituting ( y ):( frac{3}{2} x^{2} + left(2 + frac{1}{x - 1}right)^2 )Let me expand the squared term:( left(2 + frac{1}{x - 1}right)^2 = 4 + frac{4}{x - 1} + frac{1}{(x - 1)^2} )So, putting it all together, the expression becomes:( frac{3}{2} x^{2} + 4 + frac{4}{x - 1} + frac{1}{(x - 1)^2} )Hmm, so now I have an expression in terms of ( x ) only. Let me denote this as ( f(x) ):( f(x) = frac{3}{2} x^{2} + 4 + frac{4}{x - 1} + frac{1}{(x - 1)^2} )I need to find the minimum value of ( f(x) ) for ( x > 1 ).To find the minimum, I should take the derivative of ( f(x) ) with respect to ( x ), set it equal to zero, and solve for ( x ). Then, I can check if that critical point is indeed a minimum.Let me compute ( f'(x) ):First, let's write ( f(x) ) as:( f(x) = frac{3}{2} x^{2} + 4 + 4(x - 1)^{-1} + (x - 1)^{-2} )Now, taking the derivative term by term:- The derivative of ( frac{3}{2} x^{2} ) is ( 3x ).- The derivative of 4 is 0.- The derivative of ( 4(x - 1)^{-1} ) is ( -4(x - 1)^{-2} ).- The derivative of ( (x - 1)^{-2} ) is ( -2(x - 1)^{-3} ).Putting it all together:( f'(x) = 3x - frac{4}{(x - 1)^2} - frac{2}{(x - 1)^3} )Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out some terms or find a common denominator to simplify.Let me factor out ( frac{1}{(x - 1)^3} ):( f'(x) = 3x - frac{4(x - 1) + 2}{(x - 1)^3} )Wait, let me check that:( frac{4}{(x - 1)^2} = frac{4(x - 1)}{(x - 1)^3} ) and ( frac{2}{(x - 1)^3} ) is already in the denominator. So, combining them:( frac{4(x - 1) + 2}{(x - 1)^3} = frac{4x - 4 + 2}{(x - 1)^3} = frac{4x - 2}{(x - 1)^3} )So, the derivative becomes:( f'(x) = 3x - frac{4x - 2}{(x - 1)^3} )Hmm, okay. So, ( f'(x) = 3x - frac{4x - 2}{(x - 1)^3} )To find the critical points, set ( f'(x) = 0 ):( 3x - frac{4x - 2}{(x - 1)^3} = 0 )Let me move the second term to the other side:( 3x = frac{4x - 2}{(x - 1)^3} )Multiply both sides by ( (x - 1)^3 ):( 3x (x - 1)^3 = 4x - 2 )Hmm, this looks like a quintic equation, which is generally difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it.Let me let ( t = x - 1 ). Since ( x > 1 ), ( t > 0 ).So, ( x = t + 1 ). Let me substitute this into the equation:Left side: ( 3(t + 1) t^3 )Right side: ( 4(t + 1) - 2 = 4t + 4 - 2 = 4t + 2 )So, the equation becomes:( 3(t + 1) t^3 = 4t + 2 )Let me expand the left side:( 3t^4 + 3t^3 = 4t + 2 )Bring all terms to the left side:( 3t^4 + 3t^3 - 4t - 2 = 0 )Hmm, so now I have a quartic equation:( 3t^4 + 3t^3 - 4t - 2 = 0 )This still looks complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.Let me try the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (2) over factors of the leading coefficient (3), so possible roots are ( pm1, pm2, pm1/3, pm2/3 ).Let me test ( t = 1 ):( 3(1)^4 + 3(1)^3 - 4(1) - 2 = 3 + 3 - 4 - 2 = 0 ). Oh! ( t = 1 ) is a root.So, we can factor out ( (t - 1) ) from the quartic.Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.Using synthetic division with ( t = 1 ):Coefficients: 3, 3, 0, -4, -2Bring down the 3.Multiply by 1: 3.Add to next coefficient: 3 + 3 = 6.Multiply by 1: 6.Add to next coefficient: 0 + 6 = 6.Multiply by 1: 6.Add to next coefficient: -4 + 6 = 2.Multiply by 1: 2.Add to last coefficient: -2 + 2 = 0.So, the quartic factors as ( (t - 1)(3t^3 + 6t^2 + 6t + 2) ).So, now we have:( (t - 1)(3t^3 + 6t^2 + 6t + 2) = 0 )So, the roots are ( t = 1 ) and the roots of ( 3t^3 + 6t^2 + 6t + 2 = 0 ).Let me check if the cubic has any real roots. Maybe I can factor it or use the Rational Root Theorem again.Possible rational roots for the cubic: ( pm1, pm2, pm1/3, pm2/3 ).Testing ( t = -1 ):( 3(-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 6(-1) + 2 = -3 + 6 - 6 + 2 = -1 neq 0 )Testing ( t = -2 ):( 3(-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 6(-2) + 2 = -24 + 24 - 12 + 2 = -10 neq 0 )Testing ( t = -1/3 ):( 3(-1/3)^3 + 6(-1/3)^2 + 6(-1/3) + 2 = 3(-1/27) + 6(1/9) + (-2) + 2 = (-1/9) + (2/3) + 0 = (-1/9 + 6/9) = 5/9 neq 0 )Testing ( t = -2/3 ):( 3(-2/3)^3 + 6(-2/3)^2 + 6(-2/3) + 2 = 3(-8/27) + 6(4/9) + (-4) + 2 = (-24/27) + (24/9) + (-2) = (-8/9) + (8/3) - 2 = (-8/9 + 24/9 - 18/9) = (-2/9) neq 0 )So, no rational roots. Maybe I can check the number of real roots using the derivative.Let me compute the derivative of the cubic:( f(t) = 3t^3 + 6t^2 + 6t + 2 )( f'(t) = 9t^2 + 12t + 6 )Set ( f'(t) = 0 ):( 9t^2 + 12t + 6 = 0 )Divide by 3:( 3t^2 + 4t + 2 = 0 )Discriminant: ( 16 - 24 = -8 ), which is negative. So, the cubic has no critical points, meaning it's always increasing or decreasing. Since the leading coefficient is positive, it tends to ( +infty ) as ( t to +infty ) and ( -infty ) as ( t to -infty ). Therefore, it must cross the x-axis exactly once. So, the cubic has one real root and two complex roots.But since ( t > 0 ) in our substitution, we need to check if the real root is positive.Let me evaluate the cubic at ( t = 0 ):( f(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 > 0 )At ( t = -1 ), we saw it was -1, but since ( t > 0 ), we can ignore negative roots.Wait, actually, since the cubic tends to ( +infty ) as ( t to +infty ) and ( f(0) = 2 ), which is positive, and since it's always increasing (as the derivative is always positive because discriminant is negative and leading coefficient is positive), it never crosses zero for ( t > 0 ). Therefore, the only real root in ( t > 0 ) is ( t = 1 ).So, the only critical point is at ( t = 1 ), which corresponds to ( x = t + 1 = 2 ).So, ( x = 2 ). Let me find the corresponding ( y ).From earlier, ( y = 2 + frac{1}{x - 1} ). So, if ( x = 2 ), then ( y = 2 + frac{1}{2 - 1} = 2 + 1 = 3 ).So, the critical point is at ( x = 2 ), ( y = 3 ).Now, I need to check if this is indeed a minimum. Since it's the only critical point for ( x > 1 ), and the function tends to infinity as ( x ) approaches 1 from the right and as ( x ) approaches infinity, this critical point must be a minimum.Let me compute the second derivative to confirm concavity, but maybe it's easier to just test values around ( x = 2 ).Alternatively, since it's the only critical point and the function tends to infinity on both ends, it must be a minimum.So, now, let me compute the value of ( frac{3}{2} x^{2} + y^{2} ) at ( x = 2 ), ( y = 3 ):( frac{3}{2} (2)^2 + (3)^2 = frac{3}{2} times 4 + 9 = 6 + 9 = 15 )So, the minimum value is 15.Wait, let me double-check my calculations.First, ( x = 2 ), ( y = 3 ).Compute ( frac{3}{2} x^2 ): ( frac{3}{2} times 4 = 6 ).Compute ( y^2 ): ( 9 ).Add them together: ( 6 + 9 = 15 ). Yep, that seems correct.Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me verify the substitution into the original equation:( xy - 2x - y + 1 = 0 )Plugging ( x = 2 ), ( y = 3 ):( 2 times 3 - 2 times 2 - 3 + 1 = 6 - 4 - 3 + 1 = 0 ). Perfect, it satisfies the equation.So, all steps seem correct, and the minimum value is indeed 15.**Final Answer**The minimum value is boxed{15}."},{"question":"If[sin x + cos x + tan x + cot x + sec x + csc x = 7,]then find sin 2x.","answer":"Alright, so I have this trigonometric equation:[sin x + cos x + tan x + cot x + sec x + csc x = 7]And I need to find (sin 2x). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that (sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x), so maybe if I can find (sin x cos x), I can find (sin 2x). That seems like a good plan.First, let me write down all the trigonometric identities I know that might be helpful here. I know that:- (tan x = frac{sin x}{cos x})- (cot x = frac{cos x}{sin x})- (sec x = frac{1}{cos x})- (csc x = frac{1}{sin x})So, substituting these into the equation, I can rewrite everything in terms of (sin x) and (cos x). Let me try that.Let me denote (s = sin x) and (c = cos x) for simplicity. Then, the equation becomes:[s + c + frac{s}{c} + frac{c}{s} + frac{1}{c} + frac{1}{s} = 7]Okay, so now everything is in terms of (s) and (c). Maybe I can combine terms or find a common denominator. Let me see.Looking at the terms:1. (s + c)2. (frac{s}{c} + frac{c}{s})3. (frac{1}{c} + frac{1}{s})Hmm, perhaps I can group the terms:First group: (s + c)Second group: (frac{s}{c} + frac{c}{s})Third group: (frac{1}{c} + frac{1}{s})Let me compute each group separately.Starting with the first group: (s + c). That's straightforward.Second group: (frac{s}{c} + frac{c}{s}). Let me combine these two fractions:[frac{s^2 + c^2}{sc}]But wait, (s^2 + c^2 = 1), that's a Pythagorean identity. So this simplifies to:[frac{1}{sc}]Third group: (frac{1}{c} + frac{1}{s}). Let me combine these as well:[frac{s + c}{sc}]So, putting it all together, the original equation becomes:[(s + c) + frac{1}{sc} + frac{s + c}{sc} = 7]Let me denote (t = s + c). Then, the equation becomes:[t + frac{1}{sc} + frac{t}{sc} = 7]Hmm, okay. Let me factor out (frac{1}{sc}) from the last two terms:[t + frac{1 + t}{sc} = 7]So, now I have:[t + frac{1 + t}{sc} = 7]I need another equation involving (t) and (sc). I remember that:[(s + c)^2 = s^2 + 2sc + c^2 = 1 + 2sc]So, (t^2 = 1 + 2sc), which means:[sc = frac{t^2 - 1}{2}]Great, so now I can express (sc) in terms of (t). Let me substitute this into the equation:[t + frac{1 + t}{frac{t^2 - 1}{2}} = 7]Simplify the denominator:[frac{1 + t}{frac{t^2 - 1}{2}} = frac{2(1 + t)}{t^2 - 1}]Notice that (t^2 - 1 = (t - 1)(t + 1)), so we can factor that:[frac{2(1 + t)}{(t - 1)(t + 1)} = frac{2}{t - 1}]So, substituting back into the equation:[t + frac{2}{t - 1} = 7]Now, this is an equation in terms of (t). Let me write it as:[t + frac{2}{t - 1} = 7]To solve for (t), let's multiply both sides by (t - 1) to eliminate the denominator:[t(t - 1) + 2 = 7(t - 1)]Expanding both sides:Left side: (t^2 - t + 2)Right side: (7t - 7)Bring all terms to the left side:[t^2 - t + 2 - 7t + 7 = 0]Combine like terms:[t^2 - 8t + 9 = 0]So, we have a quadratic equation:[t^2 - 8t + 9 = 0]Let me solve for (t) using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is (t^2 - 8t + 9 = 0), so (a = 1), (b = -8), (c = 9).Discriminant (D = b^2 - 4ac = 64 - 36 = 28).So, the solutions are:[t = frac{8 pm sqrt{28}}{2} = frac{8 pm 2sqrt{7}}{2} = 4 pm sqrt{7}]So, (t = 4 + sqrt{7}) or (t = 4 - sqrt{7}).Now, recall that (t = s + c = sin x + cos x). The maximum value of (sin x + cos x) is (sqrt{2}), approximately 1.414, and the minimum is (-sqrt{2}). However, in our equation, the sum of all those terms is 7, which is positive, so (t) must be positive. Let's compute the numerical values of (4 + sqrt{7}) and (4 - sqrt{7}).Compute (4 + sqrt{7}): (sqrt{7}) is approximately 2.6458, so (4 + 2.6458 approx 6.6458), which is way larger than (sqrt{2}). Similarly, (4 - sqrt{7} approx 4 - 2.6458 approx 1.3542), which is less than (sqrt{2}) (since (sqrt{2} approx 1.4142)). So, (4 - sqrt{7}) is approximately 1.3542, which is less than (sqrt{2}), so it's possible.Wait, but (t = sin x + cos x) can be at most (sqrt{2}), so (t = 4 + sqrt{7}) is impossible because it's about 6.6458, which is way larger than (sqrt{2}). Therefore, the only feasible solution is (t = 4 - sqrt{7}).So, (t = 4 - sqrt{7}). Now, let's find (sc = sin x cos x). Earlier, we had:[sc = frac{t^2 - 1}{2}]So, let's compute (t^2):[t^2 = (4 - sqrt{7})^2 = 16 - 8sqrt{7} + 7 = 23 - 8sqrt{7}]Therefore,[sc = frac{23 - 8sqrt{7} - 1}{2} = frac{22 - 8sqrt{7}}{2} = 11 - 4sqrt{7}]So, (sin x cos x = 11 - 4sqrt{7}). But wait, (sin x cos x) must be between (-frac{1}{2}) and (frac{1}{2}), right? Because (sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x), and (sin 2x) is between -1 and 1, so (sin x cos x) is between -0.5 and 0.5.But (11 - 4sqrt{7}) is approximately (11 - 4*2.6458 = 11 - 10.5832 = 0.4168), which is within the range. So, that's okay.Therefore, (sin x cos x = 11 - 4sqrt{7}). Then, (sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x = 2(11 - 4sqrt{7}) = 22 - 8sqrt{7}).Wait, but hold on. Let me check my calculation again because 11 - 4√7 is approximately 0.4168, which is positive, so 2*(11 - 4√7) is approximately 0.8336, which is less than 1, so it's okay. So, (sin 2x = 22 - 8sqrt{7}).Wait, but 22 - 8√7 is approximately 22 - 21.1664 = 0.8336, which is correct. So, (sin 2x) is approximately 0.8336, which is within the valid range for sine.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me go back step by step.We had:1. (t = sin x + cos x = 4 - sqrt{7})2. Then, (t^2 = (4 - sqrt{7})^2 = 16 + 7 - 8sqrt{7} = 23 - 8sqrt{7})3. Then, (sc = frac{t^2 - 1}{2} = frac{22 - 8sqrt{7}}{2} = 11 - 4sqrt{7})4. Then, (sin 2x = 2 sc = 22 - 8sqrt{7})Yes, that seems correct. So, (sin 2x = 22 - 8sqrt{7}).But just to make sure, let me compute (22 - 8sqrt{7}):Compute (8sqrt{7}): 8*2.6458 ≈ 21.1664So, 22 - 21.1664 ≈ 0.8336Which is approximately 0.8336, which is a valid value for sine, as it's between -1 and 1.Wait, but let me check if (t = 4 - sqrt{7}) is indeed valid. Since (4 - sqrt{7} ≈ 1.3542), which is less than (sqrt{2} ≈ 1.4142), so it's within the possible range for (sin x + cos x). So, that seems okay.Therefore, I think my answer is correct. So, (sin 2x = 22 - 8sqrt{7}).But just to make sure, let me verify the original equation with this value.If (sin 2x = 22 - 8sqrt{7}), then (sin x cos x = (22 - 8sqrt{7}) / 2 = 11 - 4sqrt{7}).So, let's compute each term in the original equation:1. (sin x + cos x = t = 4 - sqrt{7})2. (tan x + cot x = frac{sin x}{cos x} + frac{cos x}{sin x} = frac{sin^2 x + cos^2 x}{sin x cos x} = frac{1}{sc} = frac{1}{11 - 4sqrt{7}})3. (sec x + csc x = frac{1}{cos x} + frac{1}{sin x} = frac{sin x + cos x}{sin x cos x} = frac{t}{sc} = frac{4 - sqrt{7}}{11 - 4sqrt{7}})So, let's compute each part:First, compute (frac{1}{11 - 4sqrt{7}}). To rationalize the denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by (11 + 4sqrt{7}):[frac{1 times (11 + 4sqrt{7})}{(11 - 4sqrt{7})(11 + 4sqrt{7})} = frac{11 + 4sqrt{7}}{121 - 16*7} = frac{11 + 4sqrt{7}}{121 - 112} = frac{11 + 4sqrt{7}}{9}]Similarly, compute (frac{4 - sqrt{7}}{11 - 4sqrt{7}}):Multiply numerator and denominator by (11 + 4sqrt{7}):[frac{(4 - sqrt{7})(11 + 4sqrt{7})}{(11 - 4sqrt{7})(11 + 4sqrt{7})} = frac{44 + 16sqrt{7} - 11sqrt{7} - 4*7}{121 - 112} = frac{44 + 5sqrt{7} - 28}{9} = frac{16 + 5sqrt{7}}{9}]So, now, let's compute each part:1. (t = 4 - sqrt{7})2. (tan x + cot x = frac{11 + 4sqrt{7}}{9})3. (sec x + csc x = frac{16 + 5sqrt{7}}{9})Now, add them all together:[(4 - sqrt{7}) + frac{11 + 4sqrt{7}}{9} + frac{16 + 5sqrt{7}}{9}]First, combine the fractions:[frac{11 + 4sqrt{7} + 16 + 5sqrt{7}}{9} = frac{27 + 9sqrt{7}}{9} = 3 + sqrt{7}]So, total sum is:[(4 - sqrt{7}) + (3 + sqrt{7}) = 4 - sqrt{7} + 3 + sqrt{7} = 7]Yes! It adds up to 7, which matches the original equation. So, my solution is correct. Therefore, (sin 2x = 22 - 8sqrt{7}).**Final Answer**boxed{22 - 8sqrt{7}}"},{"question":"Calculate the limit of the function:lim _{x rightarrow a}left(frac{sin x}{sin a}right)^{frac{1}{x-a}}","answer":"Okay, so I have this limit to calculate: the limit as x approaches a of (sin x / sin a) raised to the power of 1/(x - a). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.First, let me write it out again to make sure I have it right:lim _{x rightarrow a}left(frac{sin x}{sin a}right)^{frac{1}{x-a}}Alright, so as x approaches a, the exponent 1/(x - a) is going to either go to infinity or negative infinity, depending on the direction from which x approaches a. But since we're just taking the limit as x approaches a, I think we can consider both sides and see if it converges.I remember that when dealing with limits of the form (1 + something) raised to the power of something else, especially when it's approaching infinity, we can use the exponential function and logarithms to simplify. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of the expression to make it easier to handle.Let me denote the original expression as L:L = lim _{x rightarrow a}left(frac{sin x}{sin a}right)^{frac{1}{x-a}}Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:ln L = lim _{x rightarrow a} frac{1}{x - a} lnleft(frac{sin x}{sin a}right)So now, I have:ln L = lim _{x rightarrow a} frac{ln(sin x) - ln(sin a)}{x - a}Wait a minute, that looks like the definition of a derivative! Specifically, the derivative of ln(sin x) at x = a. Because the derivative of a function f(x) at a point a is:f'(a) = lim_{x to a} frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}So in this case, f(x) is ln(sin x), so f'(a) would be the derivative of ln(sin x) evaluated at x = a.Let me compute that derivative. The derivative of ln(u) is (u')/u, so using the chain rule:frac{d}{dx} ln(sin x) = frac{cos x}{sin x} = cot xSo, f'(a) is cot a. Therefore, the limit becomes:ln L = cot aTherefore, to find L, I just exponentiate both sides:L = e^{cot a}Wait, let me double-check that. So, starting from the limit, I took the natural log, recognized it as a derivative, computed the derivative, and then exponentiated. That seems correct.But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the standard limit formula:lim_{x to a} left(1 + frac{f(x) - f(a)}{f(a)}right)^{frac{f(a)}{f(x) - f(a)} cdot frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}}}But I think that might complicate things more. Alternatively, I could use the expansion of sin x around x = a. Let me try that.Using the Taylor series expansion of sin x around x = a:sin x = sin a + cos a (x - a) - frac{sin a}{2}(x - a)^2 + cdotsSo, dividing both sides by sin a:frac{sin x}{sin a} = 1 + cot a (x - a) - frac{1}{2}(x - a)^2 + cdotsTherefore, the expression inside the limit becomes:1 + cot a (x - a) - frac{1}{2}(x - a)^2 + cdotsNow, raising this to the power of 1/(x - a):left(1 + cot a (x - a) - frac{1}{2}(x - a)^2 + cdots right)^{frac{1}{x - a}}As x approaches a, the higher-order terms (like (x - a)^2) become negligible compared to the linear term. So, approximately, we have:left(1 + cot a (x - a)right)^{frac{1}{x - a}}This is similar to the standard limit:lim_{t to 0} (1 + kt)^{1/t} = e^{k}Where k is a constant. In this case, k is cot a, and t is (x - a). So as x approaches a, t approaches 0, so the limit becomes e^{cot a}, which matches what I found earlier.Therefore, both methods lead me to the same conclusion: the limit is e raised to the power of cot a.Just to make sure, let me plug in a specific value for a and see if it makes sense. Let's take a = π/2. Then cot a = 0, so the limit should be e^0 = 1.Let's compute the original limit when a = π/2:lim _{x rightarrow pi/2}left(frac{sin x}{sin (pi/2)}right)^{frac{1}{x - pi/2}} = lim _{x rightarrow pi/2}left(sin xright)^{frac{1}{x - pi/2}}Since sin(π/2) = 1. Now, as x approaches π/2, sin x approaches 1, so we have 1 raised to the power of something. But the exponent is 1/(x - π/2), which goes to infinity or negative infinity. However, since sin x is approaching 1 from below as x approaches π/2 from the left and from above as x approaches from the right, but actually, near π/2, sin x is approximately 1 - (x - π/2)^2/2. So, let's see:Using the approximation sin x ≈ 1 - (x - π/2)^2/2 near x = π/2.Then, (sin x)^{1/(x - π/2)} ≈ [1 - (x - π/2)^2/2]^{1/(x - π/2)}.Let me set t = x - π/2, so as x approaches π/2, t approaches 0. Then, the expression becomes:[1 - t^2/2]^{1/t}.Taking the natural logarithm:(1/t) * ln(1 - t^2/2) ≈ (1/t) * (-t^2/2 - (t^4)/12 + ...) ≈ -t/2 - t^3/12 + ... which approaches 0 as t approaches 0.Therefore, the limit is e^0 = 1, which matches our earlier conclusion. So that seems consistent.Another test case: let a = π/4. Then cot a = 1, so the limit should be e^1 = e.Compute the original limit:lim _{x rightarrow pi/4}left(frac{sin x}{sin (pi/4)}right)^{frac{1}{x - pi/4}} = lim _{x rightarrow pi/4}left(frac{sin x}{sqrt{2}/2}right)^{frac{1}{x - pi/4}}Simplify:lim _{x rightarrow pi/4}left(sqrt{2} sin xright)^{frac{1}{x - pi/4}}Again, let's use the expansion of sin x around x = π/4.sin x ≈ sin(π/4) + cos(π/4)(x - π/4) - (sin(π/4)/2)(x - π/4)^2 + ...Which is:sin x ≈ √2/2 + √2/2 (x - π/4) - (√2/4)(x - π/4)^2 + ...Multiply by √2:√2 sin x ≈ 1 + (x - π/4) - (1/2)(x - π/4)^2 + ...So, √2 sin x ≈ 1 + t - t^2/2 where t = x - π/4.Therefore, [√2 sin x]^{1/t} ≈ [1 + t - t^2/2]^{1/t}.Again, as t approaches 0, the dominant term is 1 + t, so:[1 + t]^{1/t} approaches e as t approaches 0.Therefore, the limit is e, which is consistent with our earlier result.So, all these checks seem to confirm that the limit is indeed e^{cot a}.Therefore, I can confidently say that the limit is e raised to the cotangent of a.**Final Answer**The limit is boxed{e^{cot a}}."},{"question":"John went on a mission that was supposed to take 5 days.

Altitudes ( AD ) and ( BE ) of ( triangle ABC ) intersect at ( H ). Find the smallest possible value of the length of the segment ( AH ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: A triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, with angle BAC equal to 60 degrees. The altitudes AD and BE intersect at H. I need to find the smallest possible value of the length of the segment AH. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.First, since triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, it's a circumscribed circle, or circumcircle, with radius 1. That means all three vertices A, B, and C lie on the circumference of this circle. The angle at A is 60 degrees, so angle BAC is 60°. The altitudes AD and BE intersect at H, which is the orthocenter of the triangle. So, H is the orthocenter.I need to find the minimal length of AH. So, AH is the length from vertex A to the orthocenter H. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the orthocenter can be related to other elements of the triangle, like sides, angles, and the circumradius.Given that the triangle is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, maybe I can use some properties related to the circumradius. I recall that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and angles by the formula:[ a = 2R sin A ][ b = 2R sin B ][ c = 2R sin C ]Where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively. Since R is 1 here, this simplifies to:[ a = 2 sin A ][ b = 2 sin B ][ c = 2 sin C ]Since angle A is 60°, then side a (opposite angle A) is:[ a = 2 sin 60° = 2 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{3} ]So, side BC is of length √3. Now, I need to find the minimal AH. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the orthocenter can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.Wait, is there a formula for AH? Let me recall. I think the distance from A to H can be given by:[ AH = 2R cos A ]Is that correct? Let me verify. In a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the orthocenter is indeed 2R cos A. So, if that's the case, then:[ AH = 2 times 1 times cos 60° = 2 times frac{1}{2} = 1 ]Wait, so is AH always equal to 1? But the problem says \\"find the smallest possible value of AH.\\" If AH is always 1, then the minimal value is 1. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.Hold on, maybe this formula is only valid for certain types of triangles. Let me think. In an acute triangle, the orthocenter lies inside the triangle, and in an obtuse triangle, it lies outside. Since the triangle is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, it can be either acute or obtuse depending on the angles.Given that angle A is 60°, which is acute, but the other angles could be either acute or obtuse. So, perhaps when the triangle is acute, AH is 2R cos A, but when it's obtuse, the formula might change? Or maybe the position of H changes, so the length AH changes accordingly.Wait, actually, I think the formula AH = 2R cos A holds regardless of whether the triangle is acute or obtuse. Let me check.In triangle ABC, the distance from A to H is indeed 2R cos A. So, if angle A is 60°, then AH = 2 * 1 * cos 60° = 1. So, regardless of the other angles, AH is always 1? But the problem says \\"find the smallest possible value of AH.\\" That suggests that AH can vary, so maybe my formula is incorrect or incomplete.Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I need to consider other properties or use coordinate geometry to find AH.Let me try another approach. Let's place the triangle in the coordinate plane to make it easier. Let me set point A at (1, 0) on the unit circle. Since the circumradius is 1, the circle is centered at the origin (0,0). Then, points B and C lie somewhere on the circumference.Given that angle BAC is 60°, the angle between vectors AB and AC is 60°. So, if I fix point A at (1,0), points B and C will be located such that the angle between them as viewed from A is 60°. Let me parameterize points B and C.Let me denote point B as (cos θ, sin θ) and point C as (cos φ, sin φ). Then, the angle BAC is the angle between vectors AB and AC. The vectors AB and AC can be represented as (cos θ - 1, sin θ) and (cos φ - 1, sin φ) respectively.The angle between AB and AC is 60°, so the dot product formula gives:[ cos 60° = frac{(cos θ - 1)(cos φ - 1) + (sin θ)(sin φ)}{|vec{AB}| |vec{AC}|} ]But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.Alternatively, since the triangle is inscribed in a unit circle, the central angles correspond to twice the inscribed angles. Wait, no, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. So, angle BAC is 60°, which is an inscribed angle subtended by arc BC. Therefore, the central angle subtended by arc BC is 120°, so the arc length BC corresponds to 120°, or 2π/3 radians.Therefore, points B and C are separated by 120° on the circumference. So, if I fix point A at (1,0), then points B and C are located at angles θ and θ + 120°, or θ - 120°, relative to point A.Wait, but in terms of coordinates, if point A is at (1,0), then points B and C can be placed symmetrically with respect to the x-axis, separated by 120°. So, if I let point B be at an angle θ from the x-axis, then point C would be at θ + 120°, right?So, coordinates:Point A: (1, 0)Point B: (cos θ, sin θ)Point C: (cos (θ + 120°), sin (θ + 120°))Alternatively, since the central angle between B and C is 120°, their positions are 120° apart on the circle.Now, with this setup, I can find the coordinates of points B and C in terms of θ, then find the equations of the altitudes AD and BE, find their intersection H, and then compute the distance AH. Then, find the minimal AH as θ varies.This seems like a plan, although it might involve some computation.First, let's write down coordinates for points B and C.Point B: (cos θ, sin θ)Point C: (cos (θ + 120°), sin (θ + 120°))Simplify cos (θ + 120°) and sin (θ + 120°):Using the angle addition formulas:cos (θ + 120°) = cos θ cos 120° - sin θ sin 120°= cos θ (-1/2) - sin θ (√3/2)= - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θSimilarly,sin (θ + 120°) = sin θ cos 120° + cos θ sin 120°= sin θ (-1/2) + cos θ (√3/2)= - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θSo, point C is:( - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ, - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θ )Now, with points A, B, and C defined, let's find the equations of the altitudes AD and BE.First, altitude AD: this is the altitude from A to BC. So, we need the equation of the line BC, then find the equation of the line perpendicular to BC passing through A.Similarly, altitude BE: this is the altitude from B to AC. So, find the equation of AC, then find the equation of the line perpendicular to AC passing through B.Once we have the equations of AD and BE, we can find their intersection point H, then compute the distance from A to H.This seems involved, but let's proceed step by step.First, find the equation of line BC.Points B: (cos θ, sin θ)Point C: ( - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ, - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θ )Let me denote point C as (Cx, Cy) for simplicity.So,Cx = - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θCy = - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θSo, the coordinates of B and C are known in terms of θ.First, find the slope of BC.Slope of BC: m_{BC} = (Cy - sin θ) / (Cx - cos θ)Compute numerator: Cy - sin θ = [ - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θ ] - sin θ = - (3/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θDenominator: Cx - cos θ = [ - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ ] - cos θ = - (3/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θSo, slope m_{BC} = [ - (3/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θ ] / [ - (3/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ ]Simplify numerator and denominator:Factor out 1/2:Numerator: (1/2)( -3 sin θ + √3 cos θ )Denominator: (1/2)( -3 cos θ - √3 sin θ )So, m_{BC} = [ -3 sin θ + √3 cos θ ] / [ -3 cos θ - √3 sin θ ]Factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: √3 cos θ - 3 sin θDenominator: -3 cos θ - √3 sin θFactor out √3 from numerator and denominator:Numerator: √3 (cos θ) - 3 sin θ = √3 (cos θ - (3/√3) sin θ ) = √3 (cos θ - √3 sin θ )Denominator: -3 cos θ - √3 sin θ = -√3 ( (3/√3) cos θ + sin θ ) = -√3 ( √3 cos θ + sin θ )So, m_{BC} = [ √3 (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) ] / [ -√3 ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) ] = [ (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) ] / [ - ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) ]Simplify:m_{BC} = - [ (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) / ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) ]Let me write this as:m_{BC} = - [ (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) / ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) ]Okay, so that's the slope of BC.Now, the altitude AD is perpendicular to BC and passes through A(1,0). So, the slope of AD is the negative reciprocal of m_{BC}.So, slope of AD: m_{AD} = [ ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) / (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) ]Because the negative reciprocal of m_{BC} is [ ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) / (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) ]So, equation of AD: passes through (1,0), slope m_{AD}.Thus, equation is:y - 0 = m_{AD} (x - 1 )So,y = [ ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) / (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) ] (x - 1 )Similarly, now find the equation of altitude BE.Altitude BE is the altitude from B to AC. So, first, find the equation of AC.Points A(1,0) and C( Cx, Cy )Compute slope of AC: m_{AC} = (Cy - 0) / (Cx - 1 ) = Cy / (Cx - 1 )Compute Cy and Cx - 1:Cy = - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θCx - 1 = [ - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ ] - 1 = - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ - 1So, m_{AC} = [ - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θ ] / [ - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ - 1 ]Again, this seems complicated, but let's see if we can simplify.Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to find the equation of BE.Since BE is the altitude from B to AC, it must be perpendicular to AC. So, its slope is the negative reciprocal of m_{AC}.But computing m_{AC} seems messy. Maybe instead, we can parametrize BE.Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or parametric equations would be better.Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry is getting too involved, and I should try a trigonometric approach.Wait, another thought: in triangle ABC, since it's inscribed in a unit circle, we can use the extended law of sines, which relates the sides to the sine of the opposite angles.Given that angle A is 60°, and the circumradius R is 1, so sides:a = BC = 2R sin A = 2 * 1 * sin 60° = √3b = AC = 2R sin B = 2 sin Bc = AB = 2R sin C = 2 sin CSince in any triangle, A + B + C = 180°, so B + C = 120°, so C = 120° - B.Therefore, sides:a = √3b = 2 sin Bc = 2 sin (120° - B )Now, in triangle ABC, the orthocenter H. The distance from A to H is AH.I remember that in any triangle, the distance from a vertex to the orthocenter can be given by:AH = 2R cos AWait, earlier I thought this was the case, but the problem says \\"find the smallest possible value of AH,\\" implying that AH can vary. So, maybe this formula is only valid for acute triangles?Wait, let me check. If triangle ABC is acute, then the orthocenter lies inside the triangle, and AH = 2R cos A. If the triangle is obtuse, then the orthocenter lies outside, and the formula might still hold, but the cosine would be negative, leading to a negative distance, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps in obtuse triangles, the distance is |2R cos A|.But in our case, angle A is 60°, which is acute. So, regardless of the other angles, angle A is fixed at 60°, so AH = 2R cos A = 2 * 1 * cos 60° = 1.Wait, so does that mean AH is always 1? Then, why does the problem ask for the smallest possible value? Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.Alternatively, perhaps the formula AH = 2R cos A is only valid when the triangle is acute. If the triangle becomes obtuse, then the orthocenter lies outside, and the distance AH might be longer? Hmm.Wait, let's think about this. If triangle ABC is acute, then the orthocenter is inside, so AH is 2R cos A. If the triangle is obtuse at B or C, then the orthocenter lies outside, but does that affect the distance AH?Wait, actually, if the triangle is obtuse at B or C, then the orthocenter is outside the triangle, but the distance from A to H might still be 2R cos A, but since angle A is acute, cos A is positive, so AH is positive.Wait, but if the triangle is obtuse, does that affect the value of AH?Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose triangle ABC is right-angled at B. Then, the orthocenter is at B. So, in that case, AH would be the length from A to B, which is side AB. Since angle A is 60°, in a right-angled triangle, sides can be calculated.Wait, but in a right-angled triangle with angle A = 60°, that would mean angle C is 30°, so sides would be in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. But since the circumradius R is 1, the hypotenuse would be 2R = 2. So, sides would be 1, √3, 2. So, AB = 2 sin C = 2 sin 30° = 1, AC = 2 sin B = 2 sin 90° = 2, BC = 2 sin A = 2 sin 60° = √3.Wait, in this case, the orthocenter is at B, so AH is the length from A to B, which is AB = 1. So, AH = 1.Wait, so in the right-angled case, AH is still 1. Hmm.What if the triangle is obtuse? Let's say angle B is obtuse. Then, the orthocenter lies outside the triangle. But angle A is still 60°, so cos A is still 0.5, so AH would still be 2 * 1 * 0.5 = 1.Wait, so regardless of whether the triangle is acute, right-angled, or obtuse, as long as angle A is 60°, AH is 1? Then, why is the problem asking for the smallest possible value? Maybe I'm missing something.Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and AH can vary depending on the position of the triangle on the circle.Wait, another thought: maybe the formula AH = 2R cos A is only valid for certain configurations. Let me check the formula.Upon checking, yes, in any triangle, the distance from a vertex to the orthocenter is indeed 2R cos A. So, regardless of the type of triangle, AH = 2R cos A. So, since R = 1 and angle A = 60°, AH = 2 * 1 * cos 60° = 1.Therefore, AH is always 1, regardless of the other angles or the position of the triangle on the circle. So, the minimal value is 1.But the problem says \\"find the smallest possible value of AH,\\" which suggests that AH can vary. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.Wait, perhaps the triangle is not necessarily fixed with angle A at 60°, but angle BAC is 60°, so maybe the position of A is variable on the circle? Wait, no, the triangle is inscribed in the circle, so all vertices are on the circumference, but the position of A can vary, but angle BAC is fixed at 60°. Hmm, but in that case, the position of A affects the lengths of the sides and the position of the orthocenter.Wait, but earlier, I considered point A fixed at (1,0). Maybe if I move point A around the circle, keeping angle BAC at 60°, the triangle changes, and AH changes accordingly.Wait, but if angle BAC is fixed at 60°, then regardless of where A is on the circle, the central angle over arc BC is fixed at 120°, so points B and C are always 120° apart on the circumference. So, moving A around the circle just rotates the triangle, but doesn't change the essential properties.Therefore, in all such triangles, AH should be the same, 1.But the problem says \\"find the smallest possible value,\\" so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.Wait, another thought: maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check.In triangle ABC, the distance from A to the orthocenter H is given by AH = 2R cos A. So, if angle A is 60°, then AH = 2 * 1 * cos 60° = 1. So, regardless of the other angles, as long as angle A is 60°, AH is 1.Therefore, the minimal value is 1.But then, why does the problem say \\"find the smallest possible value\\"? Maybe I need to consider that in some configurations, AH could be longer, but the minimal is 1.Wait, but if AH is always 1, then the minimal is 1.Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.Wait, let me check another source. In triangle geometry, the distance from a vertex to the orthocenter is indeed 2R cos A. So, for angle A = 60°, AH = 2R cos 60° = R. Since R = 1, AH = 1.Therefore, regardless of the triangle's configuration, as long as angle A is 60°, AH is 1.Therefore, the minimal value is 1.But the problem says \\"find the smallest possible value,\\" which makes me think that maybe I'm wrong, because 1 is both the only value and the minimal.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in 3D, but no, it's a triangle inscribed in a circle, so it's planar.Wait, another thought: maybe the triangle is not necessarily oriented with A at a specific point, so the position of H can vary, but since angle A is fixed, perhaps AH is fixed.Wait, actually, in any triangle with angle A fixed and circumradius fixed, AH is fixed as 2R cos A. So, in this case, AH is fixed at 1.Therefore, the minimal value is 1.But to be thorough, let me consider the coordinate approach again.Earlier, I set point A at (1,0), point B at (cos θ, sin θ), and point C at ( - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ, - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θ )Then, I found the slope of BC, then the slope of AD, then the equation of AD. Similarly, I can find the equation of BE.But this seems tedious, but let's try.First, equation of AD: y = [ ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) / (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) ] (x - 1 )Similarly, equation of BE: need to find the slope of AC, then take the negative reciprocal, then write the equation.Slope of AC: m_{AC} = (Cy - 0)/(Cx - 1 ) = Cy / (Cx - 1 )Compute Cy and Cx - 1:Cy = - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θCx - 1 = [ - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ ] - 1 = - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ - 1So, m_{AC} = [ - (1/2) sin θ + (√3/2) cos θ ] / [ - (1/2) cos θ - (√3/2) sin θ - 1 ]Let me factor out 1/2:Numerator: (1/2)( - sin θ + √3 cos θ )Denominator: (1/2)( - cos θ - √3 sin θ ) - 1 = (1/2)( - cos θ - √3 sin θ - 2 )So, m_{AC} = [ ( - sin θ + √3 cos θ ) / 2 ] / [ ( - cos θ - √3 sin θ - 2 ) / 2 ] = ( - sin θ + √3 cos θ ) / ( - cos θ - √3 sin θ - 2 )Therefore, slope of AC is ( - sin θ + √3 cos θ ) / ( - cos θ - √3 sin θ - 2 )Thus, the slope of BE, which is perpendicular to AC, is the negative reciprocal:m_{BE} = [ ( - cos θ - √3 sin θ - 2 ) / ( - sin θ + √3 cos θ ) ]Simplify numerator and denominator:Numerator: - cos θ - √3 sin θ - 2Denominator: - sin θ + √3 cos θSo, m_{BE} = [ - cos θ - √3 sin θ - 2 ] / [ - sin θ + √3 cos θ ]Factor out -1 from numerator and denominator:Numerator: - ( cos θ + √3 sin θ + 2 )Denominator: - ( sin θ - √3 cos θ )So, m_{BE} = [ - ( cos θ + √3 sin θ + 2 ) ] / [ - ( sin θ - √3 cos θ ) ] = ( cos θ + √3 sin θ + 2 ) / ( sin θ - √3 cos θ )So, equation of BE: passes through point B (cos θ, sin θ ), slope m_{BE}.So, equation is:y - sin θ = [ ( cos θ + √3 sin θ + 2 ) / ( sin θ - √3 cos θ ) ] (x - cos θ )Now, we have equations of AD and BE. To find H, we need to solve these two equations.Equation of AD: y = [ ( √3 cos θ + sin θ ) / (cos θ - √3 sin θ ) ] (x - 1 )Equation of BE: y = [ ( cos θ + √3 sin θ + 2 ) / ( sin θ - √3 cos θ ) ] (x - cos θ ) + sin θThis is getting very involved. Maybe instead of trying to solve for x and y, we can find AH in terms of θ and then minimize it.But since AH is the distance from A(1,0) to H(x,y), which is sqrt( (x - 1)^2 + y^2 ). But if we can express H in terms of θ, then compute AH, and then find its minimum.But this seems too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.Wait, earlier, I thought AH = 2R cos A = 1, regardless of θ. So, perhaps in all cases, AH is 1. Therefore, the minimal value is 1.But to confirm, let me consider specific cases.Case 1: θ = 0°, so point B is at (1,0), same as point A. But that would degenerate the triangle, so θ can't be 0°.Case 2: θ = 30°, so point B is at (cos 30°, sin 30°) = (√3/2, 1/2). Then, point C is at ( - (1/2)(√3/2) - (√3/2)(1/2), - (1/2)(1/2) + (√3/2)(√3/2) )Compute Cx: - (1/2)(√3/2) - (√3/2)(1/2) = - √3/4 - √3/4 = - √3/2Cy: - (1/2)(1/2) + (√3/2)(√3/2) = - 1/4 + 3/4 = 2/4 = 1/2So, point C is at (-√3/2, 1/2)So, triangle ABC has points A(1,0), B(√3/2, 1/2), C(-√3/2, 1/2)So, this is an isoceles triangle with AB = AC.Compute the orthocenter H.But in this case, since the triangle is isoceles with AB = AC, the orthocenter lies along the altitude from A, which is also the median and angle bisector.But in this case, the altitude from A is the y-axis, since points B and C are symmetric about the y-axis.Wait, point A is at (1,0), points B and C are at (√3/2, 1/2) and (-√3/2, 1/2). So, the triangle is symmetric about the y-axis.Therefore, the altitude from A is the line x = 1, but wait, no. Wait, the altitude from A is perpendicular to BC.Wait, points B and C are at (√3/2, 1/2) and (-√3/2, 1/2). So, line BC is horizontal, y = 1/2. Therefore, the altitude from A is vertical, x = 1.Wait, but point A is at (1,0), so the altitude from A is the vertical line x=1, which intersects BC at (1, 1/2). So, foot of the altitude D is at (1, 1/2).Similarly, the altitude from B: need to find the equation.Point B is at (√3/2, 1/2). The altitude from B is perpendicular to AC.Compute slope of AC: points A(1,0) and C(-√3/2, 1/2)Slope of AC: (1/2 - 0)/(-√3/2 - 1) = (1/2) / ( - (√3/2 + 1) ) = -1 / ( √3 + 2 )Therefore, slope of AC is -1 / ( √3 + 2 ). So, slope of BE, which is perpendicular, is the negative reciprocal: ( √3 + 2 )So, equation of BE: passes through (√3/2, 1/2), slope ( √3 + 2 )Thus, equation: y - 1/2 = ( √3 + 2 )(x - √3/2 )Find intersection point H with altitude AD, which is x=1.So, substitute x=1 into equation of BE:y - 1/2 = ( √3 + 2 )(1 - √3/2 ) = ( √3 + 2 )( (2 - √3)/2 ) = [ ( √3 + 2 )(2 - √3) ] / 2Compute numerator:( √3 + 2 )(2 - √3 ) = 2√3 - (√3)^2 + 4 - 2√3 = 2√3 - 3 + 4 - 2√3 = (2√3 - 2√3) + ( -3 + 4 ) = 0 + 1 = 1Therefore, y - 1/2 = 1/2 => y = 1So, point H is at (1,1). Therefore, AH is the distance from A(1,0) to H(1,1), which is 1 unit.So, in this specific case, AH = 1.Another case: let me take θ = 60°, so point B is at (cos 60°, sin 60°) = (1/2, √3/2). Then, point C is at:Cx = - (1/2)(1/2) - (√3/2)(√3/2 ) = -1/4 - 3/4 = -1Cy = - (1/2)(√3/2 ) + (√3/2)(1/2 ) = - √3/4 + √3/4 = 0So, point C is at (-1, 0)So, triangle ABC has points A(1,0), B(1/2, √3/2), C(-1,0)This is an isoceles triangle with AC = 2, AB = 1, BC = √3Compute the orthocenter H.First, find the altitude from A to BC.Line BC: points B(1/2, √3/2) and C(-1,0)Slope of BC: (0 - √3/2 ) / ( -1 - 1/2 ) = ( -√3/2 ) / ( -3/2 ) = (√3)/3 = 1/√3So, slope of BC is 1/√3, so slope of altitude AD is -√3Equation of AD: passes through A(1,0), slope -√3So, equation: y = -√3 (x - 1 )Find intersection with BC.Equation of BC: points B(1/2, √3/2) and C(-1,0). Let's find its equation.Slope is 1/√3, so equation: y - 0 = (1/√3)(x + 1 )So, y = (1/√3)x + 1/√3Intersection with AD: set y = -√3 (x - 1 ) equal to y = (1/√3)x + 1/√3So,-√3 x + √3 = (1/√3)x + 1/√3Multiply both sides by √3 to eliminate denominators:-3x + 3 = x + 1Bring variables to left and constants to right:-3x - x = 1 - 3-4x = -2x = (-2)/(-4) = 1/2Then, y = -√3 (1/2 - 1 ) = -√3 (-1/2 ) = √3 / 2So, point D is at (1/2, √3 / 2 ), which is point B. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, point D is the foot of the altitude from A to BC, but in this case, it's coinciding with point B.Wait, that suggests that the altitude from A passes through B, which is only possible if AB is perpendicular to BC.But in this triangle, AB is from (1,0) to (1/2, √3/2 ). The slope of AB is ( √3/2 - 0 ) / (1/2 - 1 ) = ( √3/2 ) / (-1/2 ) = -√3Slope of BC is 1/√3, so the product of slopes is -√3 * 1/√3 = -1, which confirms that AB is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, triangle ABC is right-angled at B.Therefore, the orthocenter H is at point B(1/2, √3/2 )Therefore, AH is the distance from A(1,0) to H(1/2, √3/2 )Compute AH:AH = sqrt( (1 - 1/2)^2 + (0 - √3/2 )^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + ( √3 / 2 )^2 ) = sqrt( 1/4 + 3/4 ) = sqrt(1) = 1So, again, AH = 1.Another case: let me take θ = 90°, so point B is at (0,1). Then, point C is at:Cx = - (1/2)(0) - (√3/2)(1 ) = - √3 / 2Cy = - (1/2)(1 ) + (√3/2)(0 ) = - 1/2So, point C is at (-√3 / 2, -1/2 )So, triangle ABC has points A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-√3 / 2, -1/2 )Compute the orthocenter H.First, find the equation of altitude AD from A to BC.Points B(0,1) and C(-√3 / 2, -1/2 )Slope of BC: ( -1/2 - 1 ) / ( -√3 / 2 - 0 ) = ( -3/2 ) / ( -√3 / 2 ) = ( -3/2 ) * ( -2 / √3 ) = 3 / √3 = √3So, slope of BC is √3, so slope of altitude AD is -1/√3Equation of AD: passes through A(1,0), slope -1/√3So, equation: y = (-1/√3)(x - 1 )Find intersection with BC.Equation of BC: points B(0,1) and C(-√3 / 2, -1/2 )Slope is √3, so equation: y - 1 = √3 (x - 0 ) => y = √3 x + 1Set equal to equation of AD:√3 x + 1 = (-1/√3)(x - 1 )Multiply both sides by √3:3x + √3 = - (x - 1 )3x + √3 = -x + 13x + x = 1 - √34x = 1 - √3x = (1 - √3)/4Then, y = √3 x + 1 = √3 (1 - √3)/4 + 1 = ( √3 - 3 ) / 4 + 1 = ( √3 - 3 + 4 ) / 4 = ( √3 + 1 ) / 4So, point D is at ( (1 - √3)/4, ( √3 + 1 ) / 4 )Now, find equation of altitude BE from B(0,1) to AC.First, find slope of AC.Points A(1,0) and C(-√3 / 2, -1/2 )Slope of AC: ( -1/2 - 0 ) / ( -√3 / 2 - 1 ) = ( -1/2 ) / ( - (√3 / 2 + 1 ) ) = ( -1/2 ) / ( - (√3 + 2 ) / 2 ) = ( -1/2 ) * ( -2 / (√3 + 2 ) ) = 1 / (√3 + 2 )So, slope of AC is 1 / (√3 + 2 ). Therefore, slope of BE, being perpendicular, is - (√3 + 2 )Equation of BE: passes through B(0,1), slope - (√3 + 2 )So, equation: y - 1 = - (√3 + 2 )(x - 0 ) => y = - (√3 + 2 ) x + 1Find intersection H with AD.Equation of AD: y = (-1/√3)(x - 1 )Set equal:- (√3 + 2 ) x + 1 = (-1/√3)(x - 1 )Multiply both sides by √3 to eliminate denominator:- √3 (√3 + 2 ) x + √3 = - (x - 1 )Expand:- (3 + 2√3 ) x + √3 = -x + 1Bring all terms to left:- (3 + 2√3 ) x + √3 + x - 1 = 0Combine like terms:[ -3 - 2√3 + 1 ] x + ( √3 - 1 ) = 0Simplify coefficients:( -2 - 2√3 ) x + ( √3 - 1 ) = 0Solve for x:( -2 - 2√3 ) x = - ( √3 - 1 )x = [ - ( √3 - 1 ) ] / ( -2 - 2√3 ) = ( √3 - 1 ) / ( 2 + 2√3 )Factor numerator and denominator:Numerator: √3 - 1Denominator: 2(1 + √3 )Multiply numerator and denominator by (√3 - 1 ) to rationalize:x = [ (√3 - 1 )^2 ] / [ 2(1 + √3 )(√3 - 1 ) ]Compute denominator:(1 + √3 )(√3 - 1 ) = (√3)^2 - 1^2 = 3 - 1 = 2Numerator:(√3 - 1 )^2 = 3 - 2√3 + 1 = 4 - 2√3So, x = (4 - 2√3 ) / ( 2 * 2 ) = (4 - 2√3 ) / 4 = (2 - √3 ) / 2Then, y = (-1/√3)(x - 1 ) = (-1/√3)( (2 - √3 ) / 2 - 1 ) = (-1/√3)( (2 - √3 - 2 ) / 2 ) = (-1/√3)( ( -√3 ) / 2 ) = (-1/√3)( -√3 / 2 ) = (1/2 )So, point H is at ( (2 - √3 ) / 2, 1/2 )Compute AH: distance from A(1,0) to H( (2 - √3 ) / 2, 1/2 )Compute x difference: 1 - (2 - √3 ) / 2 = (2 - (2 - √3 )) / 2 = ( √3 ) / 2Y difference: 0 - 1/2 = -1/2So, AH = sqrt( ( √3 / 2 )^2 + ( -1/2 )^2 ) = sqrt( 3/4 + 1/4 ) = sqrt(1) = 1Again, AH = 1.So, in all these specific cases, AH is 1. Therefore, it seems that regardless of the position of the triangle on the circle, as long as angle BAC is 60°, AH is always 1.Therefore, the minimal value of AH is 1.But the problem says \\"find the smallest possible value,\\" so maybe I was overcomplicating it. The formula AH = 2R cos A gives 1, and in all specific cases, AH is 1. So, the minimal value is 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"Find all positive integers that can be represented in decimal form as overline{13 x y 45 z} and are divisible by 792, where x, y, z are unknown digits.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find all positive integers represented as 13xy45z in decimal form, and these numbers must be divisible by 792. The digits x, y, z are unknown, and I need to figure out what they can be. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, I remember that 792 is a composite number, so maybe I can factor it into smaller numbers to make the problem easier. Let me try factoring 792. I know that 792 divided by 8 is 99, because 8 times 99 is 792. So, 792 is 8 multiplied by 99. But wait, 99 can be further factored into 9 and 11. So, 792 is 8 × 9 × 11. That means if a number is divisible by 792, it must be divisible by each of these factors: 8, 9, and 11. That seems like a good approach—check the divisibility rules for each of these numbers.Alright, let me recall the divisibility rules for 8, 9, and 11.Starting with 8: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that's divisible by 8. In this case, the number is 13xy45z, so the last three digits are 45z. Therefore, 45z must be divisible by 8. That gives me a condition on z.Next, divisibility by 9: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. So, I need to add up all the digits of 13xy45z and set that equal to a multiple of 9. That will give me another condition involving x, y, and z.Lastly, divisibility by 11: A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of 11. That is, if I subtract the sum of the digits in the odd positions from the sum of the digits in the even positions, the result should be a multiple of 11 (including zero). So, I need to calculate that alternating sum for 13xy45z and set it equal to a multiple of 11. That will give me a third condition.Alright, so I have three conditions to satisfy:1. 45z is divisible by 8.2. The sum of all digits is divisible by 9.3. The alternating sum of digits is divisible by 11.Let me tackle each condition one by one.Starting with the first condition: 45z must be divisible by 8. Let me write that as 450 + z must be divisible by 8. So, 450 + z ≡ 0 mod 8. Let me compute 450 mod 8 first.Dividing 450 by 8: 8 × 56 = 448, so 450 - 448 = 2. Therefore, 450 ≡ 2 mod 8. So, 2 + z ≡ 0 mod 8. Therefore, z ≡ -2 mod 8, which is the same as z ≡ 6 mod 8. Since z is a single digit (0-9), the possible values for z are 6 and 14, but 14 is not a digit, so z must be 6. So, z = 6. That's straightforward.Alright, so z is 6. So, the number is now 13xy456.Moving on to the second condition: the sum of all digits must be divisible by 9. Let's compute the sum of the known digits first.The number is 1 3 x y 4 5 6. So, adding the known digits: 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6. Let's compute that: 1 + 3 is 4, plus 4 is 8, plus 5 is 13, plus 6 is 19. So, the sum of the known digits is 19. Then, we have the unknown digits x and y, so the total sum is 19 + x + y. Therefore, 19 + x + y must be divisible by 9.So, 19 + x + y ≡ 0 mod 9. Let me compute 19 mod 9. 9 × 2 = 18, so 19 - 18 = 1. Therefore, 19 ≡ 1 mod 9. So, 1 + x + y ≡ 0 mod 9. Therefore, x + y ≡ -1 mod 9, which is the same as x + y ≡ 8 mod 9. Since x and y are digits (0-9), their sum can range from 0 to 18. Therefore, the possible sums for x + y are 8 or 17 (since 8 + 9 = 17). So, either x + y = 8 or x + y = 17.Okay, so that's the second condition: x + y is either 8 or 17.Now, moving on to the third condition: the alternating sum for divisibility by 11. Let me recall that for a number, starting from the right, the digits are alternately added and subtracted. So, for the number 1 3 x y 4 5 6, let's assign positions from right to left, but actually, the standard rule is to take the sum of digits in odd positions and subtract the sum of digits in even positions. Let me confirm:Yes, the rule is: (sum of digits in odd positions) - (sum of digits in even positions) must be a multiple of 11 (including zero).So, let's number the positions from right to left, starting at position 1. Wait, actually, sometimes it's done from left to right. Let me clarify.Wait, actually, different sources might define it differently, so I need to be precise. Let me check.The standard rule is: For a number, starting from the right, alternately subtract and add the digits. If the result is a multiple of 11, then the number is divisible by 11. Alternatively, sometimes it's phrased as the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11.Wait, let me confirm with an example. Let's take 121: 1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is a multiple of 11, so 121 is divisible by 11. Alternatively, sum of odd positions: 1 + 1 = 2, sum of even positions: 2, difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is a multiple of 11.So, in that case, the rule is: (sum of digits in odd positions) - (sum of digits in even positions) ≡ 0 mod 11.Therefore, for the number 1 3 x y 4 5 6, let's assign positions from right to left as positions 1 to 7.Wait, actually, maybe it's better to assign positions from left to right. Let me see.Wait, actually, it's arbitrary as long as you're consistent. Let me assign positions from left to right, starting at position 1.So, the number is:Position 1: 1Position 2: 3Position 3: xPosition 4: yPosition 5: 4Position 6: 5Position 7: 6So, the odd positions are 1, 3, 5, 7: digits 1, x, 4, 6.The even positions are 2, 4, 6: digits 3, y, 5.Therefore, the sum of odd positions: 1 + x + 4 + 6.Sum of even positions: 3 + y + 5.Then, the difference is (1 + x + 4 + 6) - (3 + y + 5). Let's compute that.1 + x + 4 + 6 = 11 + x3 + y + 5 = 8 + ySo, the difference is (11 + x) - (8 + y) = 3 + x - y.Therefore, 3 + x - y must be a multiple of 11, including zero. So, 3 + x - y ≡ 0 mod 11.So, x - y ≡ -3 mod 11, which is the same as x - y ≡ 8 mod 11 (since -3 + 11 = 8). But since x and y are digits between 0 and 9, the possible values of x - y can range from -9 to 9. Therefore, the only possible multiple of 11 in that range is -11, 0, and 11. But since x - y can't be 11 or -11 (because x and y are single digits), the only possibility is x - y ≡ 0 mod 11, but wait, that's not correct because we have x - y ≡ 8 mod 11. Wait, 8 mod 11 is just 8, which is within the range of possible differences. So, x - y must be equal to 8 or -3, but since x and y are digits, x - y = 8 or x - y = -3.Wait, hold on. Let's think again.We have 3 + x - y ≡ 0 mod 11, so x - y ≡ -3 mod 11, which is equivalent to x - y ≡ 8 mod 11 because -3 + 11 = 8.But since x and y are digits (0-9), x - y can range from -9 to 9. So, the possible values of x - y that satisfy x - y ≡ 8 mod 11 are x - y = 8 or x - y = -3 (since 8 - 11 = -3). So, x - y can be either 8 or -3.Therefore, we have two cases:Case 1: x - y = 8Case 2: x - y = -3So, let's note that.So, from the third condition, we have either x - y = 8 or x - y = -3.Now, from the second condition, we have x + y = 8 or x + y = 17.So, now, we can set up systems of equations for each combination.Let me list all possible combinations:1. x + y = 8 and x - y = 82. x + y = 8 and x - y = -33. x + y = 17 and x - y = 84. x + y = 17 and x - y = -3Let me solve each of these systems.Starting with combination 1: x + y = 8 and x - y = 8.Adding the two equations:( x + y ) + ( x - y ) = 8 + 82x = 16x = 8Substituting back into x + y = 8:8 + y = 8y = 0So, in this case, x = 8 and y = 0.Check if x and y are digits: yes, 8 and 0 are valid digits.So, that's a possible solution: x=8, y=0.Moving on to combination 2: x + y = 8 and x - y = -3.Adding the two equations:( x + y ) + ( x - y ) = 8 + (-3)2x = 5x = 2.5But x must be an integer digit, so this is not possible. Therefore, no solution in this case.Moving to combination 3: x + y = 17 and x - y = 8.Adding the two equations:( x + y ) + ( x - y ) = 17 + 82x = 25x = 12.5Again, x must be a digit (0-9), so this is not possible. Therefore, no solution here.Finally, combination 4: x + y = 17 and x - y = -3.Adding the two equations:( x + y ) + ( x - y ) = 17 + (-3)2x = 14x = 7Substituting back into x + y = 17:7 + y = 17y = 10But y must be a digit (0-9), so y=10 is invalid. Therefore, no solution in this case.So, the only valid solution is from combination 1: x=8, y=0.Therefore, the digits are x=8, y=0, z=6.So, the number is 13 8 0 4 5 6, which is 1380456.Wait, let me confirm that. The number is 13xy45z, so substituting x=8, y=0, z=6, we get 1 3 8 0 4 5 6, which is 1380456.Let me verify if this number is indeed divisible by 792.First, check divisibility by 8: last three digits are 456. 456 divided by 8 is 57, which is an integer, so yes.Divisibility by 9: sum of digits is 1+3+8+0+4+5+6 = 1+3=4, 4+8=12, 12+0=12, 12+4=16, 16+5=21, 21+6=27. 27 is divisible by 9, so yes.Divisibility by 11: Let's compute the alternating sum. From left to right, positions 1 to 7:Positions 1,3,5,7: 1,8,4,6. Sum: 1+8+4+6=19Positions 2,4,6: 3,0,5. Sum: 3+0+5=8Difference: 19 - 8 = 11, which is divisible by 11. So, yes.Therefore, 1380456 is divisible by 8, 9, and 11, hence by 792.Is there any other solution? From the above, we saw that only combination 1 gave a valid solution, others either resulted in non-integer digits or digits outside the 0-9 range. Therefore, the only number is 1380456.Wait, just to make sure, let me check if there are any other possibilities. For example, in the third condition, we considered x - y = 8 or x - y = -3. But wait, 3 + x - y must be a multiple of 11, so it could be 11 or -11 as well, right? Because 3 + x - y could be 11 or -11, which would still satisfy the divisibility.Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The difference is 3 + x - y, which must be a multiple of 11, i.e., 0, 11, -11, 22, -22, etc. But since x and y are digits (0-9), 3 + x - y can range from 3 + 0 - 9 = -6 to 3 + 9 - 0 = 12. So, the possible multiples of 11 in that range are -11, 0, and 11. But 3 + x - y can't be -11 because the minimum is -6. Similarly, 3 + x - y can be 0 or 11.So, 3 + x - y = 0 or 11.Therefore, x - y = -3 or 8.Wait, that's what I had before. So, x - y = -3 or 8. So, no, 3 + x - y can't be 22 or -22 because that's outside the possible range. So, only 0 and 11, which lead to x - y = -3 or 8. So, that was correct.Therefore, the only possible solutions are when x - y is -3 or 8, but only x - y =8 gave a valid solution with x + y =8, and the other cases either led to non-integer or invalid digits.Therefore, the only solution is x=8, y=0, z=6, giving the number 1380456.Just to make sure, let me compute 1380456 divided by 792.Compute 1380456 ÷ 792.First, let's see how many times 792 goes into 1380456.Compute 792 × 1000 = 792,000792 × 2000 = 1,584,000But 1,584,000 is larger than 1,380,456, so let's try 1700.792 × 1700 = 792 × 1000 + 792 × 700 = 792,000 + 554,400 = 1,346,400Subtract that from 1,380,456: 1,380,456 - 1,346,400 = 34,056Now, how many times does 792 go into 34,056?Compute 792 × 40 = 31,680Subtract: 34,056 - 31,680 = 2,376792 × 3 = 2,376So, total is 1700 + 40 + 3 = 1743Therefore, 792 × 1743 = 1,380,456So, yes, it divides exactly, confirming that 1380456 is indeed divisible by 792.Therefore, the only such number is 1380456.**Final Answer**The positive integer is boxed{1380456}."},{"question":"When the natural numbers P and P', with P>P', are divided by the natural number D, the remainders are R and R', respectively.

Let me try to parse it step by step.First, it says that when P and P' are divided by D, the remainders are R and R' respectively. So, that means P ≡ R mod D and P' ≡ R' mod D. I remember that when you divide a number by D, the remainder is less than D, so R and R' must both be between 0 and D-1.Next, it says that when PP' and RR' are divided by D, the remainders are r and r' respectively. So, PP' ≡ r mod D and RR' ≡ r' mod D. The question is asking about the relationship between r and r'. The options are whether r is always greater than r', always less, sometimes greater and sometimes less, sometimes greater and sometimes equal, or always equal.Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out if r and r' are always equal, or if one is always bigger, or if it depends on the specific numbers.Let me recall some modular arithmetic properties. I know that if a ≡ b mod D and c ≡ d mod D, then ac ≡ bd mod D. So, in this case, since P ≡ R mod D and P' ≡ R' mod D, then PP' ≡ RR' mod D. That would mean that r ≡ r' mod D. But since both r and r' are remainders when divided by D, they must be between 0 and D-1. So, if r ≡ r' mod D, and both are less than D, then r must equal r'.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, does that mean r = r' always? That would make the answer E.But let me test this with some numbers to make sure I'm not missing something.Let me pick D = 5, P = 7, P' = 6. Then R would be 7 mod 5 = 2, and R' would be 6 mod 5 = 1.Then PP' = 7*6 = 42. 42 mod 5 is 2, so r = 2.RR' = 2*1 = 2. 2 mod 5 is 2, so r' = 2. So, r = r' in this case.Another example: D = 7, P = 10, P' = 8. R = 10 mod 7 = 3, R' = 8 mod 7 = 1.PP' = 10*8 = 80. 80 mod 7: 7*11=77, so 80-77=3, so r=3.RR' = 3*1=3. 3 mod 7 is 3, so r'=3. Again, r=r'.Wait, maybe try a case where R and R' are larger. Let me pick D=10, P=15, P'=13. Then R=15 mod 10=5, R'=13 mod 10=3.PP'=15*13=195. 195 mod 10=5, so r=5.RR'=5*3=15. 15 mod 10=5, so r'=5. Still equal.Wait, is there a case where r ≠ r'? Maybe if D is 1? But D is a natural number, so D=1 is allowed. Let's see.If D=1, then any number mod 1 is 0. So R=R'=0. Then PP' mod 1 is 0, and RR' mod 1 is 0. So r=r'=0.Hmm, still equal.Wait, maybe if D is 0? But no, D is a natural number, so D can't be 0.Wait, perhaps if R or R' is 0? Let me try D=6, P=6, P'=4. Then R=6 mod 6=0, R'=4 mod 6=4.PP'=6*4=24. 24 mod 6=0, so r=0.RR'=0*4=0. 0 mod 6=0, so r'=0. Equal again.Another test: D=4, P=5, P'=3. R=5 mod 4=1, R'=3 mod 4=3.PP'=5*3=15. 15 mod 4=3, so r=3.RR'=1*3=3. 3 mod 4=3, so r'=3. Equal.Wait, is there any way that r ≠ r'? Maybe if D is larger?Wait, let's try D=3, P=4, P'=2. Then R=4 mod 3=1, R'=2 mod 3=2.PP'=4*2=8. 8 mod 3=2, so r=2.RR'=1*2=2. 2 mod 3=2, so r'=2. Equal.Wait, maybe if D is 2? Let me try D=2, P=3, P'=1. R=3 mod 2=1, R'=1 mod 2=1.PP'=3*1=3. 3 mod 2=1, so r=1.RR'=1*1=1. 1 mod 2=1, so r'=1. Equal.Wait, maybe if D is 9, P=10, P'=8. R=10 mod 9=1, R'=8 mod 9=8.PP'=10*8=80. 80 mod 9: 9*8=72, so 80-72=8, so r=8.RR'=1*8=8. 8 mod 9=8, so r'=8. Equal.Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps the confusion is that when you multiply two numbers, the remainder is the same as multiplying their remainders? So, PP' mod D is equal to (R * R') mod D. So, r = (R * R') mod D, and r' is also (R * R') mod D. So, r must equal r'.Therefore, the answer is E, r = r' always.But wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says when PP' and RR' are divided by D, the remainders are r and r' respectively. So, PP' mod D is r, and RR' mod D is r'. But since PP' ≡ RR' mod D, then r ≡ r' mod D. But since both r and r' are less than D, they must be equal. So, yes, r = r' always.Therefore, the answer is E.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Xiao Hong bought a pair of sneakers, the original price was 260 yuan, and now the store is selling them at a 30% discount.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Natural coordinates usually mean that both x and y are natural numbers, right? So, x and y should be positive integers. The equation of the parabola is y = -x²/9 + 33. I need to find all pairs (x, y) where x and y are natural numbers, and when I plug x into the equation, I get y as a natural number.Alright, so let me write down the equation again:y = - (x²) / 9 + 33Since y has to be a natural number, the expression on the right side must result in a positive integer. That means that - (x²)/9 + 33 must be a positive integer. So, let's break this down.First, let's consider the term -x²/9. Since x is a natural number, x² is a positive integer, and dividing it by 9 will give us a positive number, but since it's subtracted, it becomes negative. So, adding 33 to it must result in a positive integer.Therefore, the entire expression must be positive:- (x²)/9 + 33 > 0Let me solve this inequality to find the possible values of x.- (x²)/9 + 33 > 0Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the denominator:- x² + 297 > 0Which simplifies to:- x² > -297Multiply both sides by -1, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:x² < 297So, x² must be less than 297. Therefore, x must be less than the square root of 297.Calculating sqrt(297):Well, sqrt(289) is 17, and sqrt(324) is 18, so sqrt(297) is somewhere between 17 and 18. Let me compute 17² = 289, 17.5² = 306.25, which is more than 297. So, sqrt(297) is approximately 17.23. So, x must be less than 17.23, but since x is a natural number, x can be at most 17.So, x can take values from 1 to 17.But wait, let me confirm that. If x is 17, then x² is 289. Plugging into the equation:y = -289/9 + 33Let me compute that:289 divided by 9 is approximately 32.111..., so -32.111... + 33 is approximately 0.888..., which is less than 1. But y has to be a natural number, so y must be at least 1. Therefore, when x is 17, y is approximately 0.888, which is not a natural number. So, x can't be 17.Wait, so maybe x can be up to 16? Let's check x = 16.x = 16:y = - (16²)/9 + 33 = -256/9 + 33256 divided by 9 is approximately 28.444..., so -28.444... + 33 is approximately 4.555..., which is not an integer either. Hmm, so y is not an integer here.Wait, so maybe x can't be 16 either? Hmm, let me think.Wait, perhaps I need to find x such that x² is divisible by 9, so that when I compute -x²/9, it's an integer, and then when I add 33, it's still an integer. So, if x² is divisible by 9, then x must be divisible by 3, right? Because 9 is 3 squared, so if x is divisible by 3, then x² is divisible by 9.So, x must be a multiple of 3. Let me write that down.Let x = 3k, where k is a natural number.Then, x² = (3k)² = 9k², so x² / 9 = k².Therefore, substituting back into the equation:y = -k² + 33So, y must be equal to 33 - k².Since y must be a natural number, 33 - k² must be a positive integer. Therefore, 33 - k² > 0, which implies that k² < 33.So, k must satisfy k² < 33.Therefore, k can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 because 5² = 25 < 33, and 6² = 36 > 33.So, k can take values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.Therefore, x = 3k, so x can be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.Wait, let me check that.If k = 1, x = 3*1 = 3k = 2, x = 6k = 3, x = 9k = 4, x = 12k = 5, x = 15k = 6, x = 18, but 18² = 324, which is greater than 297, so x can't be 18.But wait, earlier we saw that x can be up to 17, but since x must be a multiple of 3, the maximum x is 15.So, x can be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.Therefore, for each of these x, y is 33 - k², where k = x/3.So, let's compute y for each x:For x = 3 (k=1):y = 33 - 1² = 32For x = 6 (k=2):y = 33 - 4 = 29For x = 9 (k=3):y = 33 - 9 = 24For x = 12 (k=4):y = 33 - 16 = 17For x = 15 (k=5):y = 33 - 25 = 8So, these are the possible y values.Wait, but let me check if these y values are positive integers. Yes, 32, 29, 24, 17, 8 are all positive integers. So, these are valid.But hold on, are these the only possible x values? Because earlier, I thought x could be up to 17, but since x must be a multiple of 3, the maximum x is 15.But wait, let me think again. Is it necessary that x must be a multiple of 3?Because if x is not a multiple of 3, then x²/9 may not be an integer, but y is defined as -x²/9 + 33. So, y must be an integer, but x²/9 doesn't have to be an integer necessarily, as long as the entire expression is an integer.Wait, that's a good point. So, perhaps x doesn't have to be a multiple of 3. Let me reconsider.Suppose x is not a multiple of 3, then x²/9 is a fraction, but when subtracted from 33, the result must be an integer. So, -x²/9 must be a rational number such that when added to 33, it becomes an integer. Therefore, x²/9 must be a rational number with denominator dividing 1, meaning that x² must be divisible by 9. Wait, so x² must be a multiple of 9, which implies that x must be a multiple of 3.Wait, that seems to bring us back to the original conclusion. Because if x² is divisible by 9, then x must be divisible by 3, since 3 is prime. So, x must be a multiple of 3.Therefore, my initial conclusion that x must be a multiple of 3 is correct.Therefore, the only possible x values are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and the corresponding y values are 32, 29, 24, 17, 8.So, that gives us 5 points.But wait, let me check for x = 0. Is x = 0 allowed? Well, natural numbers usually start from 1, so x = 0 is not considered here.Similarly, negative x values are not considered since we're dealing with natural coordinates.Therefore, the points are (3, 32), (6, 29), (9, 24), (12, 17), (15, 8). So, 5 points in total.But hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss any other x values where x² is a multiple of 9.Wait, x² is a multiple of 9 if and only if x is a multiple of 3, as 3 is prime. So, yes, x must be a multiple of 3.Therefore, x can only be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 in the range from 1 to 17, because x=18 would give x²=324, which is greater than 297, so y would be negative, which is not allowed.Wait, let me verify for x=15:x=15, y=8, which is positive.x=18, y= - (18²)/9 + 33 = -36 + 33 = -3, which is negative, so not allowed.So, yes, x can only go up to 15.Therefore, the number of such points is 5.Wait, but hold on, let me think again. Maybe I missed some x values where x² is a multiple of 9 but x is not a multiple of 3? Is that possible?Wait, if x is not a multiple of 3, then x² is not a multiple of 9. Because 3 is prime, so if 3 divides x², then 3 divides x. So, x must be a multiple of 3.Therefore, x must be a multiple of 3, so only x=3,6,9,12,15 are possible.Therefore, the number of points is 5.But wait, let me check for x=0. If x=0, y=33, which is a natural number, but x=0 is not a natural number, so it's excluded.Similarly, for negative x, but since we're dealing with natural coordinates, negative x is not considered.Therefore, the total number of points is 5.Wait, but let me check each x from 1 to 17 to see if any other x gives y as a natural number.So, let's make a table:x | x² | x²/9 | y = -x²/9 + 33 | Is y natural?---|-----|------|----------------|------------1 | 1 | 1/9 ≈ 0.111 | 33 - 0.111 ≈ 32.888 | No2 | 4 | 4/9 ≈ 0.444 | 33 - 0.444 ≈ 32.555 | No3 | 9 | 1 | 32 | Yes4 | 16 | 16/9 ≈ 1.777 | 33 - 1.777 ≈ 31.222 | No5 | 25 | 25/9 ≈ 2.777 | 33 - 2.777 ≈ 30.222 | No6 | 36 | 4 | 29 | Yes7 | 49 | 49/9 ≈ 5.444 | 33 - 5.444 ≈ 27.555 | No8 | 64 | 64/9 ≈ 7.111 | 33 - 7.111 ≈ 25.888 | No9 | 81 | 9 | 24 | Yes10 | 100 | 100/9 ≈ 11.111 | 33 - 11.111 ≈ 21.888 | No11 | 121 | 121/9 ≈ 13.444 | 33 - 13.444 ≈ 19.555 | No12 | 144 | 16 | 17 | Yes13 | 169 | 169/9 ≈ 18.777 | 33 - 18.777 ≈ 14.222 | No14 | 196 | 196/9 ≈ 21.777 | 33 - 21.777 ≈ 11.222 | No15 | 225 | 25 | 8 | Yes16 | 256 | 256/9 ≈ 28.444 | 33 - 28.444 ≈ 4.555 | No17 | 289 | 289/9 ≈ 32.111 | 33 - 32.111 ≈ 0.888 | NoSo, looking at this table, only x=3,6,9,12,15 give y as natural numbers. All other x from 1 to 17 result in y being a non-integer.Therefore, the number of such points is 5.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that for some x not divisible by 3, x²/9 is a fraction that, when subtracted from 33, gives an integer? For example, suppose x²/9 is a fraction with denominator 1, which would require x² to be a multiple of 9, which again brings us back to x being a multiple of 3.Alternatively, if x²/9 is a fraction with denominator 3, then 33 minus that fraction would have to be an integer, but 33 is an integer, so the fraction must also be an integer. Therefore, x² must be a multiple of 9, so x must be a multiple of 3.Therefore, I think my conclusion is correct.So, the points are (3,32), (6,29), (9,24), (12,17), (15,8). That's 5 points.Wait, but let me check for x=0 again. If x=0, y=33, which is a natural number, but x=0 is not a natural number, so it's excluded.Similarly, for negative x, but since we're dealing with natural coordinates, negative x is not considered.Therefore, the total number of points is 5.But wait, hold on, let me think about x=18. x=18 is beyond the x=17 limit, but just to confirm, x=18 would give y=-36 +33 = -3, which is negative, so not allowed.Therefore, the only valid x values are 3,6,9,12,15, giving y as 32,29,24,17,8 respectively.So, 5 points in total.Therefore, the answer should be 5.**Final Answer**The number of such points is boxed{5}."},{"question":"How many integers  n  (with  1 le n le 2021 ) have the property that  8n + 1  is a perfect square?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: How many integers n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2021, have the property that 8n + 1 is a perfect square. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says that 8n + 1 should be a perfect square. So, for some integer k, 8n + 1 = k². That makes sense. So, if I can find all integers k such that k² = 8n + 1, and then find the corresponding n's that are within the range 1 to 2021, that should give me the answer.Let me write that equation down: 8n + 1 = k². So, solving for n, we get n = (k² - 1)/8. Since n has to be an integer, (k² - 1) must be divisible by 8. So, k² ≡ 1 mod 8. Hmm, okay. So, I need to find all k such that when squared, they give a remainder of 1 when divided by 8.I remember that quadratic residues modulo 8 are limited. Let me recall: the possible residues of squares modulo 8 are 0, 1, and 4. So, if k² ≡ 1 mod 8, then k must be odd because even numbers squared are congruent to 0 or 4 mod 8. Let me check that.If k is even, say k = 2m, then k² = 4m². If m is even, m² is 0 mod 8, so k² is 0 mod 8. If m is odd, m² is 1 mod 8, so k² is 4 mod 8. So, indeed, even k's squared give 0 or 4 mod 8. Therefore, for k² ≡ 1 mod 8, k must be odd.So, k must be an odd integer. Let me represent k as 2m + 1, where m is an integer. Then, k² = (2m + 1)² = 4m² + 4m + 1. So, plugging back into the equation for n: n = (4m² + 4m + 1 - 1)/8 = (4m² + 4m)/8 = (m² + m)/2.So, n = (m² + m)/2. Hmm, interesting. So, n must be a triangular number. Wait, is that right? Because triangular numbers are given by the formula n = m(m + 1)/2. So, yes, exactly. So, n must be a triangular number.But wait, let me make sure. So, n = (m² + m)/2. So, for each integer m, we get an n. But n has to be between 1 and 2021. So, I need to find all integers m such that (m² + m)/2 is between 1 and 2021.Alternatively, since k = 2m + 1, and k² = 8n + 1, we can also think in terms of k. So, k² must be between 8*1 + 1 = 9 and 8*2021 + 1 = 16169. So, k must satisfy 9 ≤ k² ≤ 16169. Therefore, k must be between 3 and sqrt(16169). Let me compute sqrt(16169). Hmm, 127² is 16129, because 120² is 14400, 130² is 16900, so 127² is 16129, and 128² is 16384. So, sqrt(16169) is between 127 and 128. Specifically, 127² = 16129, so 16169 - 16129 = 40, so sqrt(16169) is 127 + 40/(2*127) approximately, but it's not an integer. So, the maximum integer k is 127, since 127² = 16129, which is less than 16169, and 128² is 16384, which is more than 16169.Wait, but hold on. If k² = 8n + 1, and n can be up to 2021, then k² can be up to 8*2021 + 1 = 16169. So, the maximum k is the floor of sqrt(16169). Since 127² = 16129 and 128² = 16384, as I said, so the maximum k is 127.But since k must be odd, as established earlier, let's list the possible k's. Starting from k = 3, since k must be at least 3 (because 8n + 1 must be at least 9, as n is at least 1). So, k can be 3, 5, 7, ..., up to 127.So, how many odd integers are there from 3 to 127 inclusive? Let me compute that. The sequence is 3, 5, 7, ..., 127. This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 3, last term 127, common difference 2.The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1. So, ((127 - 3)/2) + 1 = (124/2) + 1 = 62 + 1 = 63. So, there are 63 terms. So, does that mean there are 63 such integers n?Wait, hold on. Let me check if all these k's will give n within 1 to 2021. Because n = (k² - 1)/8. So, for k = 127, n = (127² - 1)/8 = (16129 - 1)/8 = 16128/8 = 2016. Which is within 1 to 2021. So, that's fine.What about k = 129? Wait, 129 is beyond our upper limit because 129² = 16641, which is greater than 16169, so n would be (16641 - 1)/8 = 16640/8 = 2080, which is beyond 2021. So, yes, k can't go beyond 127.But wait, let me check for k = 1. If k = 1, then n = (1 - 1)/8 = 0, which is less than 1, so it's invalid. Similarly, k = -1 would give n = 0, which is also invalid. So, we start from k = 3.So, the number of valid k's is 63, each corresponding to a unique n. Therefore, the number of integers n is 63.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Another way to think about it is that n must be a triangular number, as we saw earlier, since n = m(m + 1)/2. So, the question reduces to finding how many triangular numbers are less than or equal to 2021.Triangular numbers are given by n = m(m + 1)/2. So, we can solve for m in the inequality m(m + 1)/2 ≤ 2021.Multiplying both sides by 2: m² + m ≤ 4042.So, m² + m - 4042 ≤ 0.This is a quadratic inequality. Let's solve the equation m² + m - 4042 = 0.Using the quadratic formula: m = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*4042)] / 2.Compute sqrt(1 + 16168) = sqrt(16169). Wait, that's the same as before. sqrt(16169) is approximately 127.2, since 127² is 16129 and 128² is 16384.So, m = [-1 + 127.2]/2 ≈ (126.2)/2 ≈ 63.1.Since m must be a positive integer, the maximum m is 63, because at m = 63, n = 63*64/2 = 2016, which is less than 2021. At m = 64, n = 64*65/2 = 2080, which is more than 2021. So, m can be from 1 to 63.Wait, but hold on. Earlier, I considered k starting from 3, which corresponds to m starting from 1, since k = 2m + 1. So, m = 1 gives k = 3, m = 2 gives k = 5, etc., up to m = 63 gives k = 127.So, that's consistent with the previous result. So, the number of such n is 63.Wait, but hold on again. Let me check m = 0. If m = 0, then n = 0, which is invalid. So, m starts at 1, giving n = 1. So, m ranges from 1 to 63, giving n from 1 to 2016. So, that's 63 numbers.But wait, n can go up to 2021, but the maximum n we get is 2016. So, does that mean that 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 are not triangular numbers? Let me check.Compute n = m(m + 1)/2 for m = 63: 63*64/2 = 2016.m = 64: 64*65/2 = 2080, which is beyond 2021. So, yes, n = 2016 is the last triangular number before 2021. So, that's correct.Therefore, the number of integers n is 63.But wait, let me cross-verify. Let's compute the number of k's. From k = 3 to k = 127, stepping by 2. So, the number of terms is ((127 - 3)/2) + 1 = (124/2) + 1 = 62 + 1 = 63. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, if I think of k as odd numbers starting from 3, the number of such k's is equal to the number of odd numbers between 3 and 127 inclusive. Since 127 is odd, the count is ((127 - 3)/2) + 1 = 63.So, both approaches give me 63. So, that seems solid.But just to be thorough, let me check a few small cases.For n = 1: 8*1 + 1 = 9 = 3², which is perfect square. So, n = 1 is valid.n = 3: 8*3 + 1 = 25 = 5², which is perfect square.n = 6: 8*6 + 1 = 49 = 7², perfect square.n = 10: 8*10 + 1 = 81 = 9², perfect square.So, these correspond to k = 3, 5, 7, 9, etc., which is consistent with our earlier reasoning.So, each n is a triangular number, and each corresponds to an odd k starting from 3.Therefore, the number of such n is 63.Wait, but hold on, I just thought of something. When k is negative, does that give another solution? For example, k = -3 would give n = (9 - 1)/8 = 1, same as k = 3. Similarly, k = -5 gives n = (25 - 1)/8 = 3, same as k = 5. So, negative k's give the same n as their positive counterparts. So, in our count, do we have to consider both positive and negative k's?Wait, in our earlier reasoning, we considered k starting from 3 up to 127, which are all positive. So, if we include negative k's, we would get the same n's again. But since n is determined uniquely by |k|, we don't need to count negative k's separately because they don't produce new n's.Therefore, our count of 63 is correct because we only consider positive k's, which give unique n's.So, I think that's thorough. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the answer should be 63.**Final Answer**The number of integers ( n ) is boxed{63}."},{"question":"To the nearest thousandth, log_{10}2 is .301 and log_{10}3 is .477.

This gives me the expression log10(10) / log10(5).Next, I know that log base 10 of 10 is equal to 1 because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself.

Additionally, construct the center of the circle.","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It involves a quarter circle ( AOB ), and points ( A_1 ) and ( B_1 ) which are the first trisection points of the radii from point ( O ). I need to find the radius of a circle that is tangent to two semicircles with diameters ( AA_1 ) and ( BB_1 ), and also tangent to the arc ( AB ). The segment ( OA_1 ) is given as the unit of measurement. Additionally, I need to construct the center of this circle. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, let me sketch the figure mentally. There's a quarter circle ( AOB ), which means it's a 90-degree sector with center at ( O ). Points ( A ) and ( B ) are the endpoints of the arc, and ( OA ) and ( OB ) are the radii. Now, ( A_1 ) and ( B_1 ) are the first trisection points on ( OA ) and ( OB ) respectively. Since ( OA_1 ) is the unit, that means ( OA_1 = 1 ). Since they are trisection points, the entire radius ( OA ) must be three times ( OA_1 ), so ( OA = 3 ). Therefore, the radius of the quarter circle is 3 units.Wait, hold on. If ( A_1 ) is the first trisection point, does that mean it's closer to ( O ) or closer to ( A )? I think it's closer to ( O ), so ( OA_1 = 1 ) and ( A_1A = 2 ). Similarly, ( OB_1 = 1 ) and ( B_1B = 2 ). So, the entire radius is 3 units.Now, the semicircles with diameters ( AA_1 ) and ( BB_1 ). Let me think about that. The diameter ( AA_1 ) is 2 units because ( AA_1 = OA - OA_1 = 3 - 1 = 2 ). Similarly, ( BB_1 = 2 ). So, each of these semicircles has a radius of 1 unit. These semicircles are drawn on the radii ( OA ) and ( OB ), right? So, the semicircle on ( AA_1 ) would be above the radius ( OA ), and the semicircle on ( BB_1 ) would be above the radius ( OB ). Since it's a quarter circle, the semicircles are in the same plane as the quarter circle.Now, the circle we need to find is tangent to both of these semicircles and also tangent to the arc ( AB ) of the quarter circle. So, it's nestled between the two semicircles and the arc. Let me try to imagine where this circle would be. It must lie somewhere near the center of the quarter circle, but offset towards the arc ( AB ).Since all the elements are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of ( AOB ), which is the line at 45 degrees from ( OA ) and ( OB ), the center of the desired circle must lie along this bisector. That simplifies things because we can work in a coordinate system where ( O ) is the origin, ( OA ) is along the x-axis, ( OB ) is along the y-axis, and the bisector is the line ( y = x ).Let me set up a coordinate system. Let’s place point ( O ) at (0,0), point ( A ) at (3,0), and point ( B ) at (0,3). Then, ( A_1 ) is at (1,0) and ( B_1 ) is at (0,1). The semicircle with diameter ( AA_1 ) would have its center at the midpoint of ( AA_1 ), which is at (2,0), and radius 1. Similarly, the semicircle with diameter ( BB_1 ) has its center at (0,2) with radius 1.Wait, no. The diameter is ( AA_1 ), which is from (3,0) to (1,0). So, the midpoint is at (2,0), and the semicircle is above the diameter, meaning it's the upper half of the circle with center (2,0) and radius 1. Similarly, the semicircle with diameter ( BB_1 ) is from (0,3) to (0,1), midpoint at (0,2), and the semicircle is the right half of the circle with center (0,2) and radius 1.Wait, hold on. Actually, the semicircle with diameter ( AA_1 ) is the semicircle that lies above the diameter ( AA_1 ), which is along the x-axis from (1,0) to (3,0). So, the semicircle is the upper half, so it's centered at (2,0) with radius 1, and spans from (1,0) to (3,0). Similarly, the semicircle with diameter ( BB_1 ) is the right half of the circle centered at (0,2) with radius 1, spanning from (0,1) to (0,3).So, both semicircles are in the first quadrant, one along the x-axis and one along the y-axis, each with radius 1. The quarter circle ( AOB ) is the arc from (3,0) to (0,3), which is part of the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3.Now, the circle we need is tangent to both of these semicircles and also tangent to the arc ( AB ). Let's denote the center of this circle as ( (h,h) ) because it lies along the bisector ( y = x ). Let the radius of this circle be ( r ).So, the circle is tangent to the semicircle centered at (2,0) with radius 1. The distance between the centers of these two circles should be equal to the sum of their radii since they are externally tangent. Similarly, the distance between the centers of our desired circle and the semicircle at (0,2) should also be equal to the sum of their radii.Additionally, the circle is tangent to the arc ( AB ), which is part of the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 3. The distance between the centers of our desired circle and the quarter circle should be equal to the difference of their radii since they are internally tangent.Let me write down these distance equations.First, the distance between ( (h,h) ) and (2,0) should be ( r + 1 ). So,( sqrt{(h - 2)^2 + (h - 0)^2} = r + 1 )Similarly, the distance between ( (h,h) ) and (0,2) should also be ( r + 1 ):( sqrt{(h - 0)^2 + (h - 2)^2} = r + 1 )Wait, actually, both these distances are the same because of the symmetry, so we only need one equation from this.Next, the distance between ( (h,h) ) and (0,0) should be equal to ( 3 - r ), since the circle is tangent internally to the quarter circle of radius 3.So,( sqrt{(h - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2} = 3 - r )Simplify that:( sqrt{2h^2} = 3 - r )Which is:( hsqrt{2} = 3 - r )So, ( r = 3 - hsqrt{2} )Okay, so now we have an expression for ( r ) in terms of ( h ). Let's plug this into the first equation.From the first distance equation:( sqrt{(h - 2)^2 + h^2} = r + 1 )Substitute ( r = 3 - hsqrt{2} ):( sqrt{(h - 2)^2 + h^2} = (3 - hsqrt{2}) + 1 )Simplify the right side:( 4 - hsqrt{2} )So, we have:( sqrt{(h - 2)^2 + h^2} = 4 - hsqrt{2} )Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:( (h - 2)^2 + h^2 = (4 - hsqrt{2})^2 )Expand both sides:Left side:( (h^2 - 4h + 4) + h^2 = 2h^2 - 4h + 4 )Right side:( 16 - 8hsqrt{2} + 2h^2 )So, set them equal:( 2h^2 - 4h + 4 = 16 - 8hsqrt{2} + 2h^2 )Subtract ( 2h^2 ) from both sides:( -4h + 4 = 16 - 8hsqrt{2} )Bring all terms to one side:( -4h + 4 - 16 + 8hsqrt{2} = 0 )Simplify:( -4h - 12 + 8hsqrt{2} = 0 )Factor out 4h:( 4h(-1 + 2sqrt{2}) - 12 = 0 )Wait, let me do it step by step.Wait, actually, let me combine like terms:( (-4h + 8hsqrt{2}) + (4 - 16) = 0 )Which is:( h(-4 + 8sqrt{2}) - 12 = 0 )So,( h(8sqrt{2} - 4) = 12 )Therefore,( h = frac{12}{8sqrt{2} - 4} )Simplify the denominator:Factor out 4:( h = frac{12}{4(2sqrt{2} - 1)} = frac{3}{2sqrt{2} - 1} )To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by ( 2sqrt{2} + 1 ):( h = frac{3(2sqrt{2} + 1)}{(2sqrt{2} - 1)(2sqrt{2} + 1)} )Compute the denominator:( (2sqrt{2})^2 - (1)^2 = 8 - 1 = 7 )So,( h = frac{3(2sqrt{2} + 1)}{7} )Simplify:( h = frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} )So, ( h = frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} ). Now, let's find ( r ):From earlier, ( r = 3 - hsqrt{2} )Substitute ( h ):( r = 3 - left( frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} right) sqrt{2} )Multiply out the terms:( r = 3 - left( frac{6sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2} + 3sqrt{2}}{7} right) )Simplify ( sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2} = 2 ):( r = 3 - left( frac{6 cdot 2 + 3sqrt{2}}{7} right) )Which is:( r = 3 - left( frac{12 + 3sqrt{2}}{7} right) )Convert 3 to sevenths:( r = frac{21}{7} - frac{12 + 3sqrt{2}}{7} = frac{21 - 12 - 3sqrt{2}}{7} = frac{9 - 3sqrt{2}}{7} )Factor out 3:( r = frac{3(3 - sqrt{2})}{7} )So, ( r = frac{3(3 - sqrt{2})}{7} ). Let me compute this value numerically to check if it makes sense.Compute ( 3 - sqrt{2} approx 3 - 1.4142 = 1.5858 )Multiply by 3: ( 3 * 1.5858 ≈ 4.7574 )Divide by 7: ( 4.7574 / 7 ≈ 0.6796 )So, ( r ≈ 0.68 ). Let me see if this seems reasonable.Given that the semicircles have radius 1, and the quarter circle has radius 3, a circle of radius ~0.68 seems plausible. It's smaller than 1, which makes sense because it's nestled between the two semicircles and the larger arc.Let me verify the calculations step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the distance equations:1. Distance from ( (h,h) ) to (2,0):( sqrt{(h - 2)^2 + h^2} = r + 1 )2. Distance from ( (h,h) ) to (0,2):Same as above, due to symmetry.3. Distance from ( (h,h) ) to (0,0):( sqrt{2h^2} = 3 - r )So, ( hsqrt{2} = 3 - r ) => ( r = 3 - hsqrt{2} )Substituting into first equation:( sqrt{(h - 2)^2 + h^2} = 4 - hsqrt{2} )Squaring both sides:( (h - 2)^2 + h^2 = 16 - 8hsqrt{2} + 2h^2 )Expanding:Left: ( h^2 - 4h + 4 + h^2 = 2h^2 - 4h + 4 )Right: ( 16 - 8hsqrt{2} + 2h^2 )Set equal:( 2h^2 - 4h + 4 = 2h^2 + 16 - 8hsqrt{2} )Subtract ( 2h^2 ):( -4h + 4 = 16 - 8hsqrt{2} )Bring all terms to left:( -4h + 4 - 16 + 8hsqrt{2} = 0 )Simplify:( -4h - 12 + 8hsqrt{2} = 0 )Factor:( h(-4 + 8sqrt{2}) = 12 )So,( h = frac{12}{8sqrt{2} - 4} )Factor denominator:( 4(2sqrt{2} - 1) )So,( h = frac{12}{4(2sqrt{2} - 1)} = frac{3}{2sqrt{2} - 1} )Multiply numerator and denominator by ( 2sqrt{2} + 1 ):( h = frac{3(2sqrt{2} + 1)}{(2sqrt{2})^2 - (1)^2} = frac{3(2sqrt{2} + 1)}{8 - 1} = frac{3(2sqrt{2} + 1)}{7} )So, ( h = frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} ). Then, ( r = 3 - hsqrt{2} ):( r = 3 - frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} cdot sqrt{2} )Multiply:( frac{6sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2} + 3sqrt{2}}{7} = frac{12 + 3sqrt{2}}{7} )Thus,( r = 3 - frac{12 + 3sqrt{2}}{7} = frac{21 - 12 - 3sqrt{2}}{7} = frac{9 - 3sqrt{2}}{7} )Yes, that seems correct. So, the radius is ( frac{9 - 3sqrt{2}}{7} ). Alternatively, factoring 3, it's ( frac{3(3 - sqrt{2})}{7} ).Let me just check if this radius makes sense in terms of the distances.Compute ( h = frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} approx frac{6*1.4142 + 3}{7} ≈ frac{8.4852 + 3}{7} ≈ frac{11.4852}{7} ≈ 1.6408 )So, ( h ≈ 1.64 ). Then, ( r = 3 - hsqrt{2} ≈ 3 - 1.64*1.4142 ≈ 3 - 2.32 ≈ 0.68 ), which matches the earlier calculation.Now, let me check the distance from ( (h,h) ) to (2,0):( sqrt{(1.64 - 2)^2 + (1.64)^2} ≈ sqrt{(-0.36)^2 + 2.69} ≈ sqrt{0.1296 + 2.69} ≈ sqrt{2.8196} ≈ 1.68 )And ( r + 1 ≈ 0.68 + 1 = 1.68 ). So, that checks out.Similarly, the distance from ( (h,h) ) to (0,0):( sqrt{1.64^2 + 1.64^2} ≈ sqrt{2.69 + 2.69} ≈ sqrt{5.38} ≈ 2.32 )And ( 3 - r ≈ 3 - 0.68 = 2.32 ). That also checks out.So, all the distance equations are satisfied with these values. Therefore, the radius ( r ) is indeed ( frac{9 - 3sqrt{2}}{7} ).To construct the center, since it lies along the bisector ( y = x ), we can find the point ( (h, h) ) where ( h = frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} ). So, the center is located at ( left( frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7}, frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} right) ).Alternatively, if we want to express ( h ) in a different form, we can write it as ( frac{3(2sqrt{2} + 1)}{7} ), but both forms are equivalent.So, summarizing, the radius of the desired circle is ( frac{9 - 3sqrt{2}}{7} ), and its center is at ( left( frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7}, frac{6sqrt{2} + 3}{7} right) ).**Final Answer**The radius of the circle is boxed{dfrac{9 - 3sqrt{2}}{7}}."},{"question":"Simplify and then evaluate: dfrac{a}{a-b}left(dfrac{1}{b}-dfrac{1}{a}right)+dfrac{a-1}{b}, where a=2 and b=dfrac{1}{3}.","answer":"First, I'll substitute the given values ( a = 2 ) and ( b = frac{1}{3} ) into the expression.The expression becomes:[frac{2}{2 - frac{1}{3}} left( frac{1}{frac{1}{3}} - frac{1}{2} right) + frac{2 - 1}{frac{1}{3}}]Next, I'll simplify each part step by step. Starting with the denominator ( 2 - frac{1}{3} ), which equals ( frac{5}{3} ). So, the first fraction becomes ( frac{2}{frac{5}{3}} = frac{6}{5} ).Then, simplifying inside the parentheses: ( frac{1}{frac{1}{3}} = 3 ), so ( 3 - frac{1}{2} = frac{5}{2} ).Multiplying these results: ( frac{6}{5} times frac{5}{2} = 3 ).Finally, simplifying the last term: ( frac{1}{frac{1}{3}} = 3 ).Adding all parts together: ( 3 + 3 = 6 )."},{"question":"Given that x=-1 is a root of the quadratic equation x^{2}+mx=3, the value of m is:A: 0 or 2B: 2C: 0D: -2","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: (x^2 + m x = 3).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, since (x = -1) is a root, that means when I plug (x = -1) into the equation, it should satisfy it.

Let me write that out.Substituting (x = -1):[(-1)^2 + m(-1) = 3]Calculating each term:[1 - m = 3]So, simplifying this equation:[1 - m = 3]Subtract 1 from both sides:[-m = 2]Multiply both sides by -1:[m = -2]Wait, so (m = -2). Let me check the options. Option D is -2. So, is that the answer? Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.Let me double-check my substitution. The original equation is (x^2 + m x = 3). Plugging in (x = -1):[(-1)^2 + m(-1) = 3][1 - m = 3][-m = 3 - 1][-m = 2][m = -2]Yes, that seems correct. So, (m = -2). So, the answer should be D: -2.But wait, let me think again. Quadratic equations have two roots, right? So, if one root is (x = -1), maybe I can find the other root and then use the sum and product of roots to find (m). Let me try that approach to confirm.The quadratic equation is (x^2 + m x - 3 = 0) (I moved the 3 to the left side). So, in standard form, it's (x^2 + m x - 3 = 0).For a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), the sum of the roots is (-b/a) and the product is (c/a). Here, (a = 1), (b = m), and (c = -3).Let the roots be (r_1) and (r_2). We know that (r_1 = -1). So, the sum of the roots is (r_1 + r_2 = -m/1 = -m). Therefore, (-1 + r_2 = -m), which implies (r_2 = -m + 1).The product of the roots is (r_1 times r_2 = c/a = -3/1 = -3). So, (-1 times r_2 = -3). Therefore, (r_2 = (-3)/(-1) = 3).So, (r_2 = 3). Then, from earlier, (r_2 = -m + 1). So, substituting:[3 = -m + 1]Subtract 1 from both sides:[2 = -m]Multiply both sides by -1:[m = -2]Okay, so using the sum and product of roots also gives me (m = -2). So, that's consistent with my first method. Therefore, I'm confident that (m = -2).Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in moving the 3 to the left side. The original equation was (x^2 + m x = 3). So, subtracting 3 from both sides gives (x^2 + m x - 3 = 0). Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can factor the quadratic equation. Let me try that. If (x = -1) is a root, then ((x + 1)) is a factor. So, let me factor (x^2 + m x - 3) as ((x + 1)(x + a)), where (a) is the other root.Expanding ((x + 1)(x + a)):[x^2 + (a + 1)x + a]Comparing this with the original quadratic (x^2 + m x - 3), we can equate coefficients:1. Coefficient of (x^2): 1 in both, so that's fine.2. Coefficient of (x): (a + 1 = m)3. Constant term: (a = -3)So, from the constant term, (a = -3). Then, substituting into the coefficient of (x):[-3 + 1 = m][-2 = m]So, again, (m = -2). So, that's consistent as well.Hmm, so all three methods—substitution, sum and product of roots, factoring—lead me to (m = -2). Therefore, the correct answer should be D: -2.Just to be thorough, let me plug (m = -2) back into the original equation and see if (x = -1) is indeed a root.Original equation with (m = -2):[x^2 - 2x = 3]Bring 3 to the left:[x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0]Now, plug (x = -1):[(-1)^2 - 2(-1) - 3 = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0]Yes, that works. So, (x = -1) is indeed a root when (m = -2). Therefore, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.I wonder why the options include 0 or 2, 2, 0, and -2. Maybe someone might think that since (x = -1) is a root, the quadratic can be written as ((x + 1)(x - k) = 0), and then expanding it, but if they miscalculate the signs, they might get a different value. Alternatively, maybe they confused the sum and product.Wait, if someone thought that the sum of the roots is (m) instead of (-m), they might have added 1 and 3 to get 4 and set that equal to (m), which would be wrong. Or maybe they thought the product is (m) instead of (-3). Hmm, but in that case, they might get a different answer.Alternatively, if someone didn't move the 3 to the left side correctly, they might have messed up the equation. For example, if they thought the equation was (x^2 + m x = 3), and didn't subtract 3, then when they plugged in (x = -1), they might have done:[(-1)^2 + m(-1) = 3][1 - m = 3][-m = 2][m = -2]Wait, that's actually the correct method. So, maybe the confusion comes from elsewhere.Alternatively, maybe someone thought that since (x = -1) is a root, then (x = 1) is the other root, but that's not necessarily the case unless the equation is symmetric or something. But in this case, the other root is 3, as we saw earlier.So, yeah, I think the correct answer is D: -2.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Given that points ( P ) and ( Q ) are inside triangle ( triangle ABC ), and[begin{array}{l}overrightarrow{PA} + 2overrightarrow{PB} + 3overrightarrow{PC} = 2overrightarrow{QA} + 3overrightarrow{QB} + 5overrightarrow{QC} = mathbf{0}.end{array}]Find ( frac{|overrightarrow{PQ}|}{|overrightarrow{AB}|} ).(A) ( frac{1}{30} )(B) ( frac{1}{31} )(C) ( frac{1}{32} )(D) ( frac{1}{33} )","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where points P and Q are inside triangle ABC. The problem gives me two vector equations:1. (overrightarrow{PA} + 2overrightarrow{PB} + 3overrightarrow{PC} = mathbf{0})2. (2overrightarrow{QA} + 3overrightarrow{QB} + 5overrightarrow{QC} = mathbf{0})And I need to find the ratio (frac{|overrightarrow{PQ}|}{|overrightarrow{AB}|}). The options are from (A) to (D), with denominators 30, 31, 32, 33. Hmm, okay.First, I remember that vector equations like these can often be interpreted using the concept of weighted centroids or barycentric coordinates. Each equation seems to be expressing a point as a weighted average of the vertices A, B, and C.Let me recall that if you have a point inside a triangle, say P, such that ( lambda overrightarrow{PA} + mu overrightarrow{PB} + nu overrightarrow{PC} = mathbf{0} ), then P is the centroid weighted by the coefficients (lambda), (mu), and (nu). The coordinates of P can be found by dividing each weight by the sum of the weights.So, for the first equation: (overrightarrow{PA} + 2overrightarrow{PB} + 3overrightarrow{PC} = mathbf{0}). Let me rewrite this in terms of position vectors. Let me denote the position vectors of points A, B, C, P, Q as (vec{A}), (vec{B}), (vec{C}), (vec{P}), (vec{Q}) respectively.Then, (overrightarrow{PA} = vec{A} - vec{P}), (overrightarrow{PB} = vec{B} - vec{P}), and (overrightarrow{PC} = vec{C} - vec{P}).Substituting into the first equation:[(vec{A} - vec{P}) + 2(vec{B} - vec{P}) + 3(vec{C} - vec{P}) = mathbf{0}]Let me expand this:[vec{A} - vec{P} + 2vec{B} - 2vec{P} + 3vec{C} - 3vec{P} = mathbf{0}]Combine like terms:[vec{A} + 2vec{B} + 3vec{C} - (1 + 2 + 3)vec{P} = mathbf{0}]So,[vec{A} + 2vec{B} + 3vec{C} - 6vec{P} = mathbf{0}]Then, solving for (vec{P}):[6vec{P} = vec{A} + 2vec{B} + 3vec{C}][vec{P} = frac{1}{6}vec{A} + frac{2}{6}vec{B} + frac{3}{6}vec{C}][vec{P} = frac{1}{6}vec{A} + frac{1}{3}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C}]Okay, so P is a weighted average of A, B, C with weights 1, 2, 3 respectively.Similarly, let's do the same for the second equation:(2overrightarrow{QA} + 3overrightarrow{QB} + 5overrightarrow{QC} = mathbf{0})Again, express each vector in terms of position vectors:[2(vec{A} - vec{Q}) + 3(vec{B} - vec{Q}) + 5(vec{C} - vec{Q}) = mathbf{0}]Expanding:[2vec{A} - 2vec{Q} + 3vec{B} - 3vec{Q} + 5vec{C} - 5vec{Q} = mathbf{0}]Combine like terms:[2vec{A} + 3vec{B} + 5vec{C} - (2 + 3 + 5)vec{Q} = mathbf{0}]Simplify:[2vec{A} + 3vec{B} + 5vec{C} - 10vec{Q} = mathbf{0}]Solving for (vec{Q}):[10vec{Q} = 2vec{A} + 3vec{B} + 5vec{C}][vec{Q} = frac{2}{10}vec{A} + frac{3}{10}vec{B} + frac{5}{10}vec{C}][vec{Q} = frac{1}{5}vec{A} + frac{3}{10}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C}]Alright, so now I have expressions for both (vec{P}) and (vec{Q}) in terms of (vec{A}), (vec{B}), and (vec{C}). I need to find the vector (overrightarrow{PQ}), which is (vec{Q} - vec{P}), and then find its magnitude divided by the magnitude of (overrightarrow{AB}).So, let's compute (vec{Q} - vec{P}):[vec{Q} - vec{P} = left( frac{1}{5}vec{A} + frac{3}{10}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C} right) - left( frac{1}{6}vec{A} + frac{1}{3}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C} right)]Let me compute each component:For (vec{A}):[frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{6} = frac{6 - 5}{30} = frac{1}{30}]For (vec{B}):[frac{3}{10} - frac{1}{3} = frac{9 - 10}{30} = frac{-1}{30}]For (vec{C}):[frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} = 0]So, putting it all together:[vec{Q} - vec{P} = frac{1}{30}vec{A} - frac{1}{30}vec{B} + 0vec{C}][= frac{1}{30}(vec{A} - vec{B})][= frac{1}{30}overrightarrow{AB}]Wait, that's interesting. So, (overrightarrow{PQ} = frac{1}{30}overrightarrow{AB}). Therefore, the magnitude of (overrightarrow{PQ}) is (frac{1}{30}) times the magnitude of (overrightarrow{AB}). So, the ratio (frac{|overrightarrow{PQ}|}{|overrightarrow{AB}|}) is (frac{1}{30}).But hold on, looking back at the options, (A) is 1/30, which would be the answer. However, let me double-check my calculations because 1/30 seems straightforward, but sometimes these problems can have a twist.Let me verify each step.First, for point P:Starting with (overrightarrow{PA} + 2overrightarrow{PB} + 3overrightarrow{PC} = 0).Expressed as:[(vec{A} - vec{P}) + 2(vec{B} - vec{P}) + 3(vec{C} - vec{P}) = 0]Which simplifies to:[vec{A} + 2vec{B} + 3vec{C} - 6vec{P} = 0][6vec{P} = vec{A} + 2vec{B} + 3vec{C}][vec{P} = frac{1}{6}vec{A} + frac{1}{3}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C}]That seems correct.For point Q:Starting with (2overrightarrow{QA} + 3overrightarrow{QB} + 5overrightarrow{QC} = 0).Expressed as:[2(vec{A} - vec{Q}) + 3(vec{B} - vec{Q}) + 5(vec{C} - vec{Q}) = 0]Which simplifies to:[2vec{A} + 3vec{B} + 5vec{C} - 10vec{Q} = 0][10vec{Q} = 2vec{A} + 3vec{B} + 5vec{C}][vec{Q} = frac{1}{5}vec{A} + frac{3}{10}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C}]That also seems correct.Then, subtracting (vec{P}) from (vec{Q}):[vec{Q} - vec{P} = left( frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{6} right)vec{A} + left( frac{3}{10} - frac{1}{3} right)vec{B} + left( frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} right)vec{C}]Calculating each coefficient:For (vec{A}):[frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{6} = frac{6 - 5}{30} = frac{1}{30}]For (vec{B}):[frac{3}{10} - frac{1}{3} = frac{9 - 10}{30} = frac{-1}{30}]For (vec{C}):[0]So,[vec{Q} - vec{P} = frac{1}{30}vec{A} - frac{1}{30}vec{B} = frac{1}{30}(vec{A} - vec{B}) = frac{1}{30}overrightarrow{AB}]Therefore, (|overrightarrow{PQ}| = frac{1}{30}|overrightarrow{AB}|), so the ratio is (frac{1}{30}), which is option (A).Wait, but the options are (A) 1/30, (B) 1/31, (C) 1/32, (D) 1/33. So, (A) is the answer.But hold on, in my calculation, I have (overrightarrow{PQ} = frac{1}{30}overrightarrow{AB}). So, the length is 1/30 times AB. So, the ratio is 1/30, which is option (A). Hmm, but I recall sometimes in these problems, depending on the coordinate system or the specific triangle, the answer might be different. But in this case, since we're dealing with vectors and the ratio is scalar, it should hold regardless of the specific triangle.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the vectors. Let me think again.Wait, (overrightarrow{PA}) is from P to A, so it's (vec{A} - vec{P}). Similarly, (overrightarrow{PB} = vec{B} - vec{P}), and (overrightarrow{PC} = vec{C} - vec{P}). So, that part is correct.Similarly, for Q, (overrightarrow{QA} = vec{A} - vec{Q}), etc. So, that substitution is correct.So, the equations I set up are correct, leading to the expressions for (vec{P}) and (vec{Q}). Then, subtracting them gives (vec{Q} - vec{P}), which is (overrightarrow{PQ}).Wait, but in the expression, I have (overrightarrow{PQ} = frac{1}{30}overrightarrow{AB}). So, the vector PQ is 1/30 times vector AB. Therefore, the length is 1/30 times |AB|. So, the ratio is 1/30.But let me just think about whether the vector PQ is indeed in the direction of AB. In the expression, (overrightarrow{PQ} = frac{1}{30}overrightarrow{AB}), which suggests that PQ is parallel to AB and in the same direction, scaled by 1/30.But in a triangle, unless P and Q are specifically placed, PQ might not necessarily be parallel to AB. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the vector subtraction.Wait, let me double-check the subtraction:[vec{Q} - vec{P} = left( frac{1}{5}vec{A} + frac{3}{10}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C} right) - left( frac{1}{6}vec{A} + frac{1}{3}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C} right)]So, for (vec{A}): 1/5 - 1/6 = (6 - 5)/30 = 1/30.For (vec{B}): 3/10 - 1/3 = (9 - 10)/30 = -1/30.For (vec{C}): 1/2 - 1/2 = 0.So, (vec{Q} - vec{P} = frac{1}{30}vec{A} - frac{1}{30}vec{B}).Which is equal to (frac{1}{30}(vec{A} - vec{B})), which is indeed (frac{1}{30}overrightarrow{AB}).So, that seems correct. So, PQ is 1/30 of AB in length.Therefore, the ratio is 1/30, which is option (A). So, I think that is the correct answer.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the possibility that maybe I should have considered the position vectors differently.Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, people use mass point geometry or area coordinates. Let me see if that approach would give the same result.In mass point geometry, the coefficients in the vector equation correspond to masses at the points. So, for point P, the masses would be 1 at A, 2 at B, and 3 at C. So, the total mass is 6, and P is the centroid with weights 1, 2, 3.Similarly, for Q, masses are 2 at A, 3 at B, 5 at C, total mass 10.Then, to find PQ, we can express both P and Q in terms of the same coordinate system, perhaps barycentric coordinates.But in barycentric coordinates, the coordinates of P would be (1/6, 2/6, 3/6) = (1/6, 1/3, 1/2), and Q would be (2/10, 3/10, 5/10) = (1/5, 3/10, 1/2).Then, the vector PQ would be Q - P in barycentric coordinates:(1/5 - 1/6, 3/10 - 1/3, 1/2 - 1/2) = (1/30, -1/30, 0).Which is the same as what I had earlier.So, in barycentric coordinates, the vector PQ is (1/30, -1/30, 0). To find the length of PQ relative to AB, we can express PQ in terms of the vectors AB and AC.But since the third coordinate is zero, it lies along the AB direction.Wait, in barycentric coordinates, the vector (1/30, -1/30, 0) corresponds to moving 1/30 from A towards B and -1/30 from B towards A, which effectively is moving 1/30 from B towards A, but since it's a vector, it's equivalent to 1/30 of AB.Wait, no, actually, in barycentric coordinates, the coefficients correspond to weights, not necessarily directly to the vector components. So, perhaps I need to express PQ in terms of the vectors AB and AC.Alternatively, since the barycentric coordinates of PQ are (1/30, -1/30, 0), which can be written as (1/30, -1/30, 0) = 1/30*(1, -1, 0).But in barycentric coordinates, (1, -1, 0) corresponds to the vector from B to A, which is -AB. So, 1/30*(1, -1, 0) corresponds to -1/30 AB. But since we're taking the magnitude, it's the same as 1/30 AB.Therefore, the length is 1/30 |AB|, so the ratio is 1/30.Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct, the answer is (A) 1/30.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using coordinate geometry.Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (b, 0), and point C at (c, d). Then, express points P and Q in terms of these coordinates and compute PQ.Let me try that.Let me denote:A = (0, 0)B = (b, 0)C = (c, d)Then, position vectors:(vec{A} = (0, 0))(vec{B} = (b, 0))(vec{C} = (c, d))Then, from earlier, we have:(vec{P} = frac{1}{6}vec{A} + frac{1}{3}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C})So, substituting:[vec{P} = frac{1}{6}(0, 0) + frac{1}{3}(b, 0) + frac{1}{2}(c, d)][= left( frac{1}{3}b + frac{1}{2}c, 0 + 0 + frac{1}{2}d right)][= left( frac{2b + 3c}{6}, frac{d}{2} right)]Similarly, for (vec{Q}):[vec{Q} = frac{1}{5}vec{A} + frac{3}{10}vec{B} + frac{1}{2}vec{C}][= frac{1}{5}(0, 0) + frac{3}{10}(b, 0) + frac{1}{2}(c, d)][= left( frac{3b}{10} + frac{c}{2}, 0 + 0 + frac{d}{2} right)][= left( frac{3b + 5c}{10}, frac{d}{2} right)]Now, compute (overrightarrow{PQ} = vec{Q} - vec{P}):[left( frac{3b + 5c}{10} - frac{2b + 3c}{6}, frac{d}{2} - frac{d}{2} right)]Simplify the x-component:Find a common denominator for 10 and 6, which is 30.Convert fractions:[frac{3b + 5c}{10} = frac{9b + 15c}{30}][frac{2b + 3c}{6} = frac{10b + 15c}{30}]Subtract:[frac{9b + 15c - 10b - 15c}{30} = frac{-b}{30}]Y-component is 0.So, (overrightarrow{PQ} = left( -frac{b}{30}, 0 right)).But vector AB is from A(0,0) to B(b, 0), so (overrightarrow{AB} = (b, 0)).Therefore, (overrightarrow{PQ} = -frac{1}{30}overrightarrow{AB}).So, the magnitude of PQ is (frac{1}{30}) times the magnitude of AB, so the ratio is 1/30.Therefore, the answer is (A) 1/30.Just to make sure, let me compute the magnitude.|(overrightarrow{PQ})| = sqrt[ (-b/30)^2 + 0^2 ] = | -b/30 | = b/30.|(overrightarrow{AB})| = sqrt[ (b)^2 + 0^2 ] = b.Therefore, ratio is (b/30)/b = 1/30.Yep, that's consistent.So, after verifying with coordinate geometry, I'm even more confident that the answer is 1/30, which is option (A).**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Find all functions ( f: mathbb{N}^{*} longrightarrow mathbb{N}^{*} ) such that for all ( m, n ):[ fleft(f(m)^{2}+2 f(n)^{2}right)=m^{2}+2 n^{2} ]","answer":"Alright, so I came across this functional equation problem, and it's a bit challenging, but I think I can work through it step by step. The problem is to find all functions ( f: mathbb{N}^{*} longrightarrow mathbb{N}^{*} ) such that for all ( m, n ):[ fleft(f(m)^{2} + 2 f(n)^{2}right) = m^{2} + 2 n^{2} ]First off, let me parse what this means. We have a function ( f ) that takes positive integers to positive integers, and when you apply ( f ) to the expression ( f(m)^2 + 2f(n)^2 ), you get ( m^2 + 2n^2 ). So, essentially, ( f ) composed with this quadratic form gives another quadratic form. Interesting.I think a good starting point is to consider if ( f ) could be the identity function, that is, ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k in mathbb{N}^{*} ). Let me test this.If ( f(k) = k ), then the left-hand side becomes:[ fleft(f(m)^2 + 2f(n)^2right) = fleft(m^2 + 2n^2right) = m^2 + 2n^2 ]Which is exactly the right-hand side. So, the identity function is indeed a solution. But the question is asking for all such functions, so I need to check if there are other possibilities or if the identity is the only solution.To explore further, maybe I can assume that ( f ) is injective or surjective and see if that helps. Let me recall that a function is injective if ( f(a) = f(b) ) implies ( a = b ), and surjective if for every ( y ) in the codomain, there exists an ( x ) such that ( f(x) = y ).Looking at the given equation, if I fix ( m ) and vary ( n ), or fix ( n ) and vary ( m ), I might be able to deduce something about injectivity or surjectivity.Let me try to see if ( f ) is injective. Suppose ( f(a) = f(b) ). Then, for any ( n ), we have:[ fleft(f(a)^2 + 2f(n)^2right) = a^2 + 2n^2 ][ fleft(f(b)^2 + 2f(n)^2right) = b^2 + 2n^2 ]But since ( f(a) = f(b) ), the left-hand sides are equal, so:[ a^2 + 2n^2 = b^2 + 2n^2 ]Subtracting ( 2n^2 ) from both sides gives ( a^2 = b^2 ). Since ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers, this implies ( a = b ). Therefore, ( f ) is injective.Great, so ( f ) is injective. That's a useful property. Now, let's see about surjectivity. For any ( y in mathbb{N}^{*} ), can we find an ( x ) such that ( f(x) = y )?Looking at the given equation, if I set ( m = n ), then:[ fleft(f(m)^2 + 2f(m)^2right) = m^2 + 2m^2 ][ fleft(3f(m)^2right) = 3m^2 ]So, for each ( m ), ( 3m^2 ) is in the image of ( f ). Therefore, ( f ) is surjective onto the set of numbers of the form ( 3k^2 ). But we need surjectivity onto all of ( mathbb{N}^{*} ). Hmm, maybe not directly, but perhaps with more exploration.Alternatively, let's consider setting ( n ) to some specific value to see if we can get more information.Suppose I fix ( n = 1 ). Then the equation becomes:[ fleft(f(m)^2 + 2f(1)^2right) = m^2 + 2(1)^2 = m^2 + 2 ]So, for each ( m ), ( f(m^2 + 2) = fleft(f(m)^2 + 2f(1)^2right) ). Wait, that might not be directly helpful. Let me think differently.Since ( f ) is injective, maybe I can find an expression for ( f ) in terms of itself. Let me denote ( f(m) = a_m ) and ( f(n) = a_n ). Then the equation becomes:[ f(a_m^2 + 2a_n^2) = m^2 + 2n^2 ]So, ( f ) maps ( a_m^2 + 2a_n^2 ) to ( m^2 + 2n^2 ). Hmm, this seems like ( f ) is inverting the operation of squaring and combining in that specific way.Wait, if I think of ( f ) as a kind of inverse function, maybe ( f(k) ) is related to the square roots of ( k ) in some way. But ( k ) is of the form ( a_m^2 + 2a_n^2 ), so perhaps ( f ) is linear? Let me test if ( f ) could be linear, say ( f(k) = ck ) for some constant ( c ).If ( f(k) = ck ), then substituting into the equation:Left-hand side:[ fleft((cm)^2 + 2(cn)^2right) = fleft(c^2m^2 + 2c^2n^2right) = c(c^2m^2 + 2c^2n^2) = c^3m^2 + 2c^3n^2 ]Right-hand side:[ m^2 + 2n^2 ]So, equating both sides:[ c^3m^2 + 2c^3n^2 = m^2 + 2n^2 ]Which implies ( c^3 = 1 ). Since ( c ) is a positive integer, ( c = 1 ). So, ( f(k) = k ) is the only linear solution. But we already knew that. So, perhaps ( f ) is not linear, but maybe affine? Let me test ( f(k) = k + d ) for some constant ( d ).Substituting into the equation:Left-hand side:[ fleft((m + d)^2 + 2(n + d)^2right) = (m + d)^2 + 2(n + d)^2 + d ]Right-hand side:[ m^2 + 2n^2 ]So, expanding the left-hand side:[ (m^2 + 2md + d^2) + 2(n^2 + 2nd + d^2) + d = m^2 + 2md + d^2 + 2n^2 + 4nd + 2d^2 + d ][ = m^2 + 2n^2 + 2md + 4nd + 3d^2 + d ]Set equal to right-hand side:[ m^2 + 2n^2 = m^2 + 2n^2 + 2md + 4nd + 3d^2 + d ]Subtracting ( m^2 + 2n^2 ) from both sides:[ 0 = 2md + 4nd + 3d^2 + d ]This must hold for all ( m, n in mathbb{N}^{*} ). However, the right-hand side is a linear function in ( m ) and ( n ), which can only be zero for all ( m, n ) if the coefficients of ( m ), ( n ), and the constant term are all zero.So:1. Coefficient of ( m ): ( 2d = 0 ) ⇒ ( d = 0 )2. Coefficient of ( n ): ( 4d = 0 ) ⇒ ( d = 0 )3. Constant term: ( 3d^2 + d = 0 ) ⇒ ( d = 0 )Thus, ( d = 0 ), which gives ( f(k) = k ), the identity function. So, affine functions other than the identity don't work.Hmm, so maybe ( f ) isn't linear or affine. Let me think of another approach.Since ( f ) is injective, perhaps I can find an expression for ( f^{-1} ) if it exists. But wait, ( f ) is from ( mathbb{N}^{*} ) to ( mathbb{N}^{*} ), and since it's injective, it's also surjective onto its image. But earlier, when I set ( m = n ), I saw that ( 3m^2 ) is in the image of ( f ). So, ( f ) must cover all numbers of the form ( 3k^2 ). But is that enough for surjectivity?Wait, actually, if ( f ) is injective and ( mathbb{N}^{*} ) is infinite, then ( f ) must be surjective as well. Because an injective function from an infinite set to itself is surjective if it's also a bijection. But is ( f ) necessarily surjective?Wait, no. For example, the function ( f(n) = 2n ) is injective but not surjective on ( mathbb{N}^{*} ). So, ( f ) might not be surjective. Hmm, so maybe I can't assume that.But in our case, from the equation, for any ( m, n ), ( m^2 + 2n^2 ) is in the image of ( f ). So, ( f ) must map some number to ( m^2 + 2n^2 ). Therefore, the image of ( f ) includes all numbers of the form ( m^2 + 2n^2 ). But is that all of ( mathbb{N}^{*} )?Wait, not necessarily. For example, numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc., can they be expressed as ( m^2 + 2n^2 )?Let me check:- 1: ( 1 = 1^2 + 2 times 0^2 ), but ( n ) must be positive, so 0 isn't allowed. So, 1 cannot be expressed as ( m^2 + 2n^2 ) with ( m, n geq 1 ). Similarly, 2: ( 2 = 0^2 + 2 times 1^2 ), again 0 isn't allowed. So, 2 also can't be expressed. 3: ( 3 = 1^2 + 2 times 1^2 ). Yes, so 3 is in the image. 4: ( 4 = 2^2 + 2 times 0^2 ), again 0 isn't allowed. Alternatively, ( 4 = 0^2 + 2 times sqrt{2}^2 ), but that's not integer. So, 4 cannot be expressed. Wait, but 4 can be expressed as ( 2^2 + 2 times 0^2 ), but since ( n ) must be positive, that's not allowed. Hmm, so 4 isn't in the image either. Wait, but hold on, ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers, so ( m, n geq 1 ). Therefore, the smallest value of ( m^2 + 2n^2 ) is ( 1 + 2 = 3 ). So, numbers less than 3 cannot be expressed as ( m^2 + 2n^2 ). Therefore, the image of ( f ) is at least all numbers from 3 upwards, but actually, it's more specific.Wait, actually, for ( m, n geq 1 ), ( m^2 + 2n^2 geq 3 ). So, the image of ( f ) is a subset of ( mathbb{N}^{*} ) starting from 3. But ( f ) is defined from ( mathbb{N}^{*} ) to ( mathbb{N}^{*} ), so it must cover all positive integers. But according to the equation, ( f ) only needs to cover numbers of the form ( m^2 + 2n^2 ). So, unless all positive integers can be expressed as ( m^2 + 2n^2 ), which I don't think is the case.Wait, for example, 5 can be expressed as ( 1^2 + 2 times 2^2 = 1 + 8 = 9 ), no, that's 9. Wait, 5: ( 5 = 1^2 + 2 times 2^2 = 1 + 8 = 9 ), no. Alternatively, ( 5 = sqrt{5}^2 + 2 times 0^2 ), but again, not integers. So, 5 cannot be expressed as ( m^2 + 2n^2 ) with ( m, n geq 1 ). Therefore, 5 is not in the image of ( f ). But ( f ) is supposed to map ( mathbb{N}^{*} ) to ( mathbb{N}^{*} ), so 5 must be in the image. Wait, that's a contradiction.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check 5 again. ( m^2 + 2n^2 = 5 ). Let's solve for integers ( m, n geq 1 ).Trying ( n = 1 ): ( m^2 + 2 = 5 ) ⇒ ( m^2 = 3 ), not integer.( n = 2 ): ( m^2 + 8 = 5 ) ⇒ ( m^2 = -3 ), impossible.So, no solution. Therefore, 5 is not in the image of ( f ). But ( f ) is supposed to map ( mathbb{N}^{*} ) to ( mathbb{N}^{*} ), so 5 must be in the image. Therefore, this suggests that my earlier assumption that ( f ) is injective might be conflicting with the requirement that ( f ) must cover all positive integers.Wait, but earlier, I concluded that ( f ) is injective because if ( f(a) = f(b) ), then ( a^2 = b^2 ), so ( a = b ). So, ( f ) is injective. But if ( f ) is injective and its image is only a subset of ( mathbb{N}^{*} ), then it's not surjective. However, the problem states that ( f ) maps ( mathbb{N}^{*} ) to ( mathbb{N}^{*} ), but doesn't specify that it's surjective. So, maybe ( f ) doesn't have to be surjective. But in that case, how does the equation hold for all ( m, n )?Wait, the right-hand side is ( m^2 + 2n^2 ), which, as we saw, can't cover all positive integers. So, does that mean that ( f ) only needs to cover those integers that can be expressed as ( m^2 + 2n^2 )? But the problem says ( f: mathbb{N}^{*} longrightarrow mathbb{N}^{*} ), so ( f ) must be defined for all positive integers, but its image can be a subset. However, the equation must hold for all ( m, n ), so ( f ) must be defined such that ( f(m)^2 + 2f(n)^2 ) is in the domain of ( f ), which it is because it's a positive integer. But the output ( m^2 + 2n^2 ) must be in ( mathbb{N}^{*} ), which it is, but as we saw, not all positive integers can be expressed in that form.Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently.Let me consider specific values for ( m ) and ( n ) to see if I can find more information about ( f ).First, let me set ( m = n ). Then the equation becomes:[ fleft(f(m)^2 + 2f(m)^2right) = m^2 + 2m^2 ][ fleft(3f(m)^2right) = 3m^2 ]So, ( f(3f(m)^2) = 3m^2 ). Let me denote ( k = f(m) ). Then, ( f(3k^2) = 3m^2 ). But since ( k = f(m) ), we can write ( f(3k^2) = 3m^2 ). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can consider setting ( n = 1 ) and vary ( m ). Let's try that.Set ( n = 1 ):[ fleft(f(m)^2 + 2f(1)^2right) = m^2 + 2 ]Let me denote ( c = f(1) ). So, the equation becomes:[ fleft(f(m)^2 + 2c^2right) = m^2 + 2 ]This suggests that ( f ) maps ( f(m)^2 + 2c^2 ) to ( m^2 + 2 ). Since ( f ) is injective, the argument of ( f ) on the left must be unique for each ( m ). So, ( f(m)^2 + 2c^2 ) must be unique for each ( m ).But I don't know if that helps directly. Maybe I can set ( m = 1 ) as well.Set ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 1 ):[ fleft(f(1)^2 + 2f(1)^2right) = 1 + 2 ][ fleft(3c^2right) = 3 ]So, ( f(3c^2) = 3 ). But from earlier, when ( m = 1 ), we have ( f(3c^2) = 3 times 1^2 = 3 ). So, that's consistent.Now, let's set ( m = 1 ) and vary ( n ):[ fleft(f(1)^2 + 2f(n)^2right) = 1 + 2n^2 ][ fleft(c^2 + 2f(n)^2right) = 1 + 2n^2 ]So, this is similar to the earlier equation when ( n = 1 ). Let me denote ( d_n = f(n) ). Then, the equation becomes:[ fleft(c^2 + 2d_n^2right) = 1 + 2n^2 ]So, for each ( n ), ( f ) evaluated at ( c^2 + 2d_n^2 ) is ( 1 + 2n^2 ). Since ( f ) is injective, each ( c^2 + 2d_n^2 ) must be unique. Therefore, ( d_n ) must be such that ( c^2 + 2d_n^2 ) is unique for each ( n ).But this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I can try small values for ( m ) and ( n ) to find a pattern or determine ( f(1) ), ( f(2) ), etc.Let's start with ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 1 ):We already have ( f(3c^2) = 3 ). So, ( f(3c^2) = 3 ).Now, let's set ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ):[ fleft(c^2 + 2f(2)^2right) = 1 + 2(2)^2 = 1 + 8 = 9 ]So, ( f(c^2 + 2f(2)^2) = 9 ).Similarly, set ( m = 2 ) and ( n = 1 ):[ fleft(f(2)^2 + 2c^2right) = 4 + 2 = 6 ]So, ( f(f(2)^2 + 2c^2) = 6 ).Now, let's see if we can relate these equations.From ( m = 1, n = 2 ): ( f(c^2 + 2f(2)^2) = 9 ).From ( m = 2, n = 1 ): ( f(f(2)^2 + 2c^2) = 6 ).Note that ( c^2 + 2f(2)^2 ) and ( f(2)^2 + 2c^2 ) are two different expressions unless ( c = f(2) ).Wait, let's compute both:Let ( a = c^2 + 2f(2)^2 ) and ( b = f(2)^2 + 2c^2 ).If ( a = b ), then ( c^2 + 2f(2)^2 = f(2)^2 + 2c^2 ), which simplifies to ( c^2 = f(2)^2 ), so ( c = f(2) ) since they are positive integers.If ( c = f(2) ), then ( a = c^2 + 2c^2 = 3c^2 ) and ( b = c^2 + 2c^2 = 3c^2 ). So, both expressions equal ( 3c^2 ). Therefore, ( f(3c^2) = 9 ) and ( f(3c^2) = 6 ). But this is a contradiction because ( f(3c^2) ) cannot be both 9 and 6. Therefore, our assumption that ( a = b ) must be wrong, which implies that ( c neq f(2) ).Therefore, ( a neq b ), so ( f(a) = 9 ) and ( f(b) = 6 ). Since ( f ) is injective, ( a neq b ), which is consistent.So, we have two equations:1. ( f(c^2 + 2f(2)^2) = 9 )2. ( f(f(2)^2 + 2c^2) = 6 )Let me denote ( x = c^2 + 2f(2)^2 ) and ( y = f(2)^2 + 2c^2 ). So, ( f(x) = 9 ) and ( f(y) = 6 ). Also, ( x neq y ).Now, let's consider the original functional equation with ( m = x ) and ( n = y ). Wait, but ( x ) and ( y ) are specific numbers, not variables. Maybe that's not helpful.Alternatively, let's see if we can find ( f(2) ). Let me denote ( d = f(2) ). So, ( d ) is some positive integer.Then, from the above, we have:1. ( f(c^2 + 2d^2) = 9 )2. ( f(d^2 + 2c^2) = 6 )So, we have two equations involving ( c ) and ( d ).Additionally, from setting ( m = 1, n = 1 ), we have ( f(3c^2) = 3 ).Also, from setting ( m = 2, n = 2 ):[ fleft(f(2)^2 + 2f(2)^2right) = 4 + 8 = 12 ][ f(3d^2) = 12 ]So, ( f(3d^2) = 12 ).Similarly, from setting ( m = 3, n = 1 ):Wait, maybe I can find more equations.Alternatively, let's consider that ( f ) is injective, so if ( f(a) = f(b) ), then ( a = b ). So, from ( f(3c^2) = 3 ) and ( f(3d^2) = 12 ), since 3 ≠ 12, we have ( 3c^2 ≠ 3d^2 ), so ( c ≠ d ).So, ( c ) and ( d ) are distinct positive integers.Now, let's try to find possible values for ( c ) and ( d ).We have:1. ( f(c^2 + 2d^2) = 9 )2. ( f(d^2 + 2c^2) = 6 )3. ( f(3c^2) = 3 )4. ( f(3d^2) = 12 )Let me think about equation 3: ( f(3c^2) = 3 ). So, ( f ) maps ( 3c^2 ) to 3. Similarly, equation 4: ( f(3d^2) = 12 ).Since ( f ) is injective, ( 3c^2 ) must be unique, as must ( 3d^2 ). So, ( 3c^2 ) and ( 3d^2 ) are distinct because ( c ≠ d ).Now, let's think about equation 1: ( f(c^2 + 2d^2) = 9 ). So, ( c^2 + 2d^2 ) is mapped to 9. Similarly, equation 2: ( f(d^2 + 2c^2) = 6 ).So, let me list the known mappings:- ( 3c^2 mapsto 3 )- ( 3d^2 mapsto 12 )- ( c^2 + 2d^2 mapsto 9 )- ( d^2 + 2c^2 mapsto 6 )Now, let's see if we can find ( c ) and ( d ) such that these mappings are consistent.Let me assume that ( c = 1 ). Let's test this.If ( c = 1 ), then from equation 3: ( f(3 times 1^2) = f(3) = 3 ).From equation 4: ( f(3d^2) = 12 ).From equation 1: ( f(1^2 + 2d^2) = f(1 + 2d^2) = 9 ).From equation 2: ( f(d^2 + 2 times 1^2) = f(d^2 + 2) = 6 ).So, let's write down:1. ( f(3) = 3 )2. ( f(3d^2) = 12 )3. ( f(1 + 2d^2) = 9 )4. ( f(d^2 + 2) = 6 )Now, let's see if we can find ( d ).From equation 4: ( f(d^2 + 2) = 6 ). Let me denote ( k = d^2 + 2 ). So, ( f(k) = 6 ).Similarly, from equation 3: ( f(1 + 2d^2) = 9 ). Let me denote ( l = 1 + 2d^2 ). So, ( f(l) = 9 ).Now, since ( f ) is injective, ( k ) and ( l ) must be distinct, so ( d^2 + 2 ≠ 1 + 2d^2 ). Simplifying, ( d^2 + 2 ≠ 1 + 2d^2 ) ⇒ ( 2 ≠ 1 + d^2 ) ⇒ ( d^2 ≠ 1 ). Since ( d ) is a positive integer, ( d ≠ 1 ).So, ( d geq 2 ).Let me try ( d = 2 ).Then:From equation 4: ( f(2^2 + 2) = f(4 + 2) = f(6) = 6 ).From equation 3: ( f(1 + 2 times 2^2) = f(1 + 8) = f(9) = 9 ).From equation 2: ( f(3 times 2^2) = f(12) = 12 ).So, let's see if this is consistent.We have:- ( f(3) = 3 )- ( f(6) = 6 )- ( f(9) = 9 )- ( f(12) = 12 )So far, this looks like ( f(k) = k ) for ( k = 3, 6, 9, 12 ).But let's check if this holds with the original functional equation.Wait, let me see if ( f(k) = k ) for these values, but what about other values?From equation 1: ( f(1 + 2d^2) = f(9) = 9 ), which is consistent with ( f(9) = 9 ).From equation 2: ( f(d^2 + 2) = f(6) = 6 ), which is consistent.From equation 3: ( f(3d^2) = f(12) = 12 ), consistent.From equation 4: ( f(3) = 3 ), consistent.So, with ( c = 1 ) and ( d = 2 ), we get that ( f(3) = 3 ), ( f(6) = 6 ), ( f(9) = 9 ), ( f(12) = 12 ). This seems consistent.But does this mean that ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k )?Wait, let's check another value. Let's set ( m = 2 ) and ( n = 2 ):[ fleft(f(2)^2 + 2f(2)^2right) = f(3d^2) = 12 ][ 4 + 8 = 12 ]Which is consistent because ( f(12) = 12 ).Now, let's try ( m = 2 ) and ( n = 1 ):[ fleft(f(2)^2 + 2f(1)^2right) = f(4 + 2) = f(6) = 6 ][ 4 + 2 = 6 ]Consistent.Similarly, ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ):[ fleft(f(1)^2 + 2f(2)^2right) = f(1 + 8) = f(9) = 9 ][ 1 + 8 = 9 ]Consistent.So far, everything is consistent with ( f(k) = k ) for ( k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12 ). Wait, but we don't know ( f(4) ) yet.Let me try to find ( f(4) ). Let's set ( m = 2 ) and ( n = 3 ):Wait, but I don't know ( f(3) ) yet. Wait, ( f(3) = 3 ) as established earlier.Wait, let me set ( m = 2 ) and ( n = 3 ):[ fleft(f(2)^2 + 2f(3)^2right) = f(4 + 2 times 9) = f(4 + 18) = f(22) = 4 + 18 = 22 ]So, ( f(22) = 22 ). Hmm, that's consistent with ( f(k) = k ).Similarly, set ( m = 3 ) and ( n = 1 ):[ fleft(f(3)^2 + 2f(1)^2right) = f(9 + 2) = f(11) = 9 + 2 = 11 ]So, ( f(11) = 11 ).This seems to be a pattern where ( f(k) = k ) for these tested values. Maybe ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k ).But let me test ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 3 ):[ fleft(f(1)^2 + 2f(3)^2right) = f(1 + 2 times 9) = f(19) = 1 + 18 = 19 ]So, ( f(19) = 19 ).Similarly, ( m = 3 ) and ( n = 2 ):[ fleft(f(3)^2 + 2f(2)^2right) = f(9 + 8) = f(17) = 9 + 8 = 17 ]So, ( f(17) = 17 ).It seems like every time I plug in values, ( f(k) = k ) holds. Maybe this suggests that ( f ) is indeed the identity function.But to be thorough, let me check another case where ( m ) and ( n ) are larger.Let me set ( m = 4 ) and ( n = 1 ):[ fleft(f(4)^2 + 2f(1)^2right) = f(f(4)^2 + 2) = 16 + 2 = 18 ]So, ( f(f(4)^2 + 2) = 18 ). If ( f(4) = 4 ), then ( f(16 + 2) = f(18) = 18 ), which is consistent with ( f(18) = 18 ).Similarly, set ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 4 ):[ fleft(f(1)^2 + 2f(4)^2right) = f(1 + 2f(4)^2) = 1 + 2 times 16 = 33 ]So, ( f(1 + 2f(4)^2) = 33 ). If ( f(4) = 4 ), then ( f(1 + 32) = f(33) = 33 ), which is consistent.Alternatively, if ( f(4) ) were something else, say ( f(4) = k ), then ( f(k^2 + 2) = 18 ). But since ( f ) is injective, ( k^2 + 2 ) must be unique. If ( k ≠ 4 ), say ( k = 5 ), then ( f(25 + 2) = f(27) = 18 ). But earlier, we saw that ( f(27) ) should be 27 if ( f(k) = k ). So, this would be a contradiction because ( f(27) ) can't be both 18 and 27. Therefore, ( f(4) ) must be 4.This reasoning suggests that ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k ).To confirm, let me assume that ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k ), and check if it satisfies the original equation.Left-hand side:[ fleft(f(m)^2 + 2f(n)^2right) = fleft(m^2 + 2n^2right) = m^2 + 2n^2 ]Right-hand side:[ m^2 + 2n^2 ]They are equal, so ( f(k) = k ) is indeed a solution.But is it the only solution? Earlier, I assumed ( c = 1 ) and found that ( d = 2 ), leading to ( f(k) = k ). What if ( c ≠ 1 )?Wait, let's suppose ( c = 2 ). Then, from equation 3: ( f(3 times 2^2) = f(12) = 3 ). But earlier, we saw that ( f(12) = 12 ) if ( f(k) = k ). So, this would be a contradiction because ( f(12) ) can't be both 3 and 12. Therefore, ( c ) cannot be 2.Similarly, if ( c = 3 ), then ( f(3 times 3^2) = f(27) = 3 ). But if ( f(k) = k ), then ( f(27) = 27 ), which contradicts ( f(27) = 3 ). Therefore, ( c ) cannot be 3.In fact, for ( c > 1 ), ( f(3c^2) = 3 ), but if ( f(k) = k ), then ( f(3c^2) = 3c^2 ), which would have to equal 3, implying ( c = 1 ). Therefore, ( c = 1 ) is the only possibility.Thus, ( f(1) = 1 ), and from there, we deduced ( f(2) = 2 ), and so on, leading to ( f(k) = k ) for all ( k ).Therefore, the only solution is the identity function.**Final Answer**The function satisfying the equation is boxed{f(n) = n}."},{"question":"The coefficient of the linear term in the expansion of (x+1)(2x+1)(3x+1)ldots(10x+1) is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the coefficient of the linear term in the expansion of the product (x+1)(2x+1)(3x+1)...(10x+1). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.First, I remember that when you multiply out polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms come from combining different terms from each factor. In this case, each factor is of the form (kx + 1), where k goes from 1 to 10. So, we have 10 factors multiplied together.Now, the question is specifically about the linear term, which is the term with x raised to the first power. So, I need to figure out how that term is formed when we multiply all these factors.I recall that when multiplying polynomials, the coefficient of a particular term is the sum of all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in that term. For the linear term, that means I need to pick the x term from exactly one of the factors and the constant term (which is 1) from all the other factors. Then, I sum up all these possible products.Let me write that down. If I have factors (k1x + 1)(k2x + 1)...(k10x + 1), then the coefficient of x is the sum of k1 + k2 + k3 + ... + k10. Wait, is that right?Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again. If I pick the x term from one factor, say the first one, then I have k1x multiplied by 1 from all the other factors. Similarly, if I pick the x term from the second factor, it's k2x multiplied by 1 from all the others. So, each time, the coefficient is just the sum of the coefficients of x from each factor.So, in this case, each factor is (kx + 1), so the coefficient of x in each factor is k. Therefore, the coefficient of the linear term in the expansion is the sum of all these k's.So, if k goes from 1 to 10, then the coefficient is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that. So, for example, if I take a smaller case, say (x+1)(2x+1). The expansion is 2x^2 + 3x + 1. The coefficient of x is 3, which is 1 + 2. So, that works. Another example: (x+1)(2x+1)(3x+1). Let's compute that.First, multiply (x+1)(2x+1) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1. Then multiply by (3x+1):(2x^2 + 3x + 1)(3x + 1) = 6x^3 + 2x^2 + 9x^2 + 3x + 3x + 1.Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute it step by step.Multiply 2x^2 by (3x + 1): 6x^3 + 2x^2.Multiply 3x by (3x + 1): 9x^2 + 3x.Multiply 1 by (3x + 1): 3x + 1.Now, add them all together:6x^3 + 2x^2 + 9x^2 + 3x + 3x + 1.Combine like terms:6x^3 + (2x^2 + 9x^2) + (3x + 3x) + 1 = 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x + 1.So, the coefficient of x is 6, which is 1 + 2 + 3. So, that seems to hold. So, in the case of three factors, the coefficient is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.So, going back, in the original problem, with factors from (x+1) up to (10x+1), the coefficient of x should be the sum from k=1 to k=10 of k.So, let me compute that sum. The sum of the first n integers is given by n(n + 1)/2. So, for n=10, it's 10*11/2 = 55.Therefore, the coefficient of the linear term is 55.Wait, but let me think again. Is that always the case? Because sometimes when you have multiple variables or higher degrees, you might have to consider other interactions. But in this case, since we're only looking for the linear term, which is x^1, and each factor contributes either x or 1, so to get x^1, you have to pick x from exactly one factor and 1 from all the others.Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the sum of the coefficients of x in each factor, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10.So, that should be 55.But just to make sure, let me test it with another small example. Let's take (x+1)(2x+1)(3x+1)(4x+1). Let's compute the coefficient of x.First, compute (x+1)(2x+1) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1.Then, multiply by (3x+1):(2x^2 + 3x + 1)(3x + 1) = 6x^3 + 2x^2 + 9x^2 + 3x + 3x + 1 = 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x + 1.Now, multiply by (4x + 1):(6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x + 1)(4x + 1).Let's compute term by term:6x^3 * 4x = 24x^46x^3 * 1 = 6x^311x^2 * 4x = 44x^311x^2 * 1 = 11x^26x * 4x = 24x^26x * 1 = 6x1 * 4x = 4x1 * 1 = 1Now, add them all together:24x^4 + 6x^3 + 44x^3 + 11x^2 + 24x^2 + 6x + 4x + 1.Combine like terms:24x^4 + (6x^3 + 44x^3) + (11x^2 + 24x^2) + (6x + 4x) + 1.Which simplifies to:24x^4 + 50x^3 + 35x^2 + 10x + 1.So, the coefficient of x is 10. Which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. So, that works as well.Therefore, this seems consistent. So, for the original problem, the coefficient of x is the sum from 1 to 10, which is 55.Wait, but hold on, let me think again. Is there a different way to compute this? Maybe using combinations or something else?I remember that in the expansion of a product of linear terms, the coefficients can be found using the sum of the roots or something like that. But in this case, each term is (kx + 1), so the roots would be at x = -1/k. But I don't know if that helps here.Alternatively, maybe using Vieta's formula. Vieta's formula relates the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. But in this case, we have a product of linear terms, so the polynomial is already factored. So, Vieta's formula might not be directly helpful here.Alternatively, maybe using generating functions or combinatorial methods. But I think the way I approached it earlier is correct: the coefficient of x is the sum of the coefficients of x in each factor, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10.Wait, but let me think about how the expansion works. When you multiply all these terms, each term in the expansion is a product of one term from each factor. So, for the linear term, you have to choose x from exactly one factor and 1 from all the others. So, the coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of x in each factor, each multiplied by 1 from the other factors. So, that would indeed be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10.Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct. So, the coefficient is 55.But just to make sure, let me compute it step by step for a slightly larger case, say up to (4x + 1), which I did earlier, and it worked. So, I think it's safe to say that for the original problem, the coefficient is 55.So, the answer is 55.**Final Answer**The coefficient of the linear term is boxed{55}."},{"question":"Consider the hyperbola dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1 with foci F_1 and F_2. If point P lies on this hyperbola and |PF_1| = 3, then find the value of |PF_2|.","answer":"Alright, so I have this hyperbola equation: (dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1). I need to find the distance from a point (P) on this hyperbola to the other focus, given that the distance from (P) to one focus is 3. Hmm, okay.First, let me recall some properties of hyperbolas. A hyperbola is defined as the set of all points where the absolute difference of the distances to two fixed points (the foci) is constant. That constant is equal to the length of the transverse axis, which is (2a). So, for any point (P) on the hyperbola, (|PF_1 - PF_2| = 2a).Looking at the given equation, (dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1), I can see that it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right. The standard form is (dfrac{x^2}{a^2} - dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1). Comparing, (a^2 = 4), so (a = 2). Therefore, the transverse axis length is (2a = 4). So, the absolute difference of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is 4.But wait, the problem says that (|PF_1| = 3). So, we have (|PF_1 - PF_2| = 4). Let me write that down:(|PF_1 - PF_2| = 4)Given (PF_1 = 3), so:(|3 - PF_2| = 4)This equation can have two cases:1. (3 - PF_2 = 4)2. (3 - PF_2 = -4)Let me solve both.Case 1: (3 - PF_2 = 4)Subtract 3 from both sides:(-PF_2 = 1)Multiply both sides by -1:(PF_2 = -1)But distance can't be negative, so this case is invalid.Case 2: (3 - PF_2 = -4)Subtract 3 from both sides:(-PF_2 = -7)Multiply both sides by -1:(PF_2 = 7)So, the distance from (P) to (F_2) is 7. That seems straightforward. But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes.Let me recall the definition again. For hyperbola, the absolute difference is (2a), which is 4 here. So, (|PF_1 - PF_2| = 4). Given (PF_1 = 3), then (PF_2) must be either (3 + 4 = 7) or (3 - 4 = -1). Since distance can't be negative, it's 7. So, that seems correct.But just to be thorough, maybe I should find the coordinates of the foci and see if this makes sense.For a hyperbola of the form (dfrac{x^2}{a^2} - dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), the foci are located at ((pm c, 0)), where (c^2 = a^2 + b^2).Given (a^2 = 4) and (b^2 = 1), so (c^2 = 4 + 1 = 5), hence (c = sqrt{5}). So, the foci are at ((sqrt{5}, 0)) and ((- sqrt{5}, 0)).So, (F_1) is at ((sqrt{5}, 0)) and (F_2) is at ((- sqrt{5}, 0)). Let me denote (F_1 = (sqrt{5}, 0)) and (F_2 = (-sqrt{5}, 0)).Now, point (P) is on the hyperbola, so it satisfies (dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1). The distance from (P) to (F_1) is 3, so:(sqrt{(x - sqrt{5})^2 + y^2} = 3)Squaring both sides:((x - sqrt{5})^2 + y^2 = 9)Expanding the left side:(x^2 - 2sqrt{5}x + 5 + y^2 = 9)Simplify:(x^2 + y^2 - 2sqrt{5}x + 5 = 9)Subtract 9 from both sides:(x^2 + y^2 - 2sqrt{5}x - 4 = 0)But we also know that (P) is on the hyperbola, so (dfrac{x^2}{4} - y^2 = 1). Let me rewrite this as:(y^2 = dfrac{x^2}{4} - 1)So, substitute (y^2) into the previous equation:(x^2 + left( dfrac{x^2}{4} - 1 right) - 2sqrt{5}x - 4 = 0)Simplify:(x^2 + dfrac{x^2}{4} - 1 - 2sqrt{5}x - 4 = 0)Combine like terms:(left(1 + dfrac{1}{4}right)x^2 - 2sqrt{5}x - 5 = 0)Which is:(dfrac{5}{4}x^2 - 2sqrt{5}x - 5 = 0)Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:(5x^2 - 8sqrt{5}x - 20 = 0)So, we have a quadratic in terms of (x):(5x^2 - 8sqrt{5}x - 20 = 0)Let me try to solve this quadratic for (x). Using the quadratic formula:(x = dfrac{8sqrt{5} pm sqrt{(8sqrt{5})^2 - 4 cdot 5 cdot (-20)}}{2 cdot 5})Compute discriminant:((8sqrt{5})^2 = 64 cdot 5 = 320)(4 cdot 5 cdot (-20) = -400), so the discriminant is:(320 - (-400) = 320 + 400 = 720)So,(x = dfrac{8sqrt{5} pm sqrt{720}}{10})Simplify (sqrt{720}):(sqrt{720} = sqrt{36 cdot 20} = 6sqrt{20} = 6 cdot 2sqrt{5} = 12sqrt{5})So,(x = dfrac{8sqrt{5} pm 12sqrt{5}}{10})Compute both possibilities:First solution:(x = dfrac{8sqrt{5} + 12sqrt{5}}{10} = dfrac{20sqrt{5}}{10} = 2sqrt{5})Second solution:(x = dfrac{8sqrt{5} - 12sqrt{5}}{10} = dfrac{-4sqrt{5}}{10} = -dfrac{2sqrt{5}}{5})So, the x-coordinates of point (P) are (2sqrt{5}) and (-dfrac{2sqrt{5}}{5}).Now, let's find the corresponding (y) coordinates using (y^2 = dfrac{x^2}{4} - 1).First, for (x = 2sqrt{5}):(y^2 = dfrac{(2sqrt{5})^2}{4} - 1 = dfrac{4 cdot 5}{4} - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4)So, (y = pm 2). Therefore, the points are ((2sqrt{5}, 2)) and ((2sqrt{5}, -2)).Second, for (x = -dfrac{2sqrt{5}}{5}):(y^2 = dfrac{left(-dfrac{2sqrt{5}}{5}right)^2}{4} - 1 = dfrac{dfrac{4 cdot 5}{25}}{4} - 1 = dfrac{dfrac{20}{25}}{4} - 1 = dfrac{dfrac{4}{5}}{4} - 1 = dfrac{1}{5} - 1 = -dfrac{4}{5})Wait, (y^2) can't be negative. So, this solution is invalid. Therefore, the only valid points are ((2sqrt{5}, 2)) and ((2sqrt{5}, -2)).So, point (P) must be at ((2sqrt{5}, 2)) or ((2sqrt{5}, -2)). Now, let's compute the distance from (P) to (F_2), which is at ((- sqrt{5}, 0)).Compute (PF_2) for (P = (2sqrt{5}, 2)):Distance formula:(sqrt{(2sqrt{5} - (-sqrt{5}))^2 + (2 - 0)^2})Simplify inside the square roots:(2sqrt{5} + sqrt{5} = 3sqrt{5})So,(sqrt{(3sqrt{5})^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{9 cdot 5 + 4} = sqrt{45 + 4} = sqrt{49} = 7)Similarly, for (P = (2sqrt{5}, -2)):Distance formula:(sqrt{(2sqrt{5} - (-sqrt{5}))^2 + (-2 - 0)^2})Which is the same as above:(sqrt{(3sqrt{5})^2 + (-2)^2} = sqrt{45 + 4} = sqrt{49} = 7)So, in both cases, the distance (PF_2) is 7. That confirms the earlier result.Therefore, the value of (|PF_2|) is 7.**Final Answer**The value of (|PF_2|) is (boxed{7})."},{"question":"Given a geometric sequence with positive terms {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n. If S_3=3 and S_9-S_6=12, then S_6= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says that we have a geometric sequence with positive terms, denoted as {a_n}. The sum of the first n terms is S_n. We are given that S_3 = 3 and S_9 - S_6 = 12. We need to find S_6.Alright, let me recall what I know about geometric sequences. In a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio, r, to get the next term. So, the nth term is a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term.The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), when r ≠ 1.Since all terms are positive, that means a_1 > 0 and r > 0. Also, since it's a geometric sequence, r can't be 1 because then it would be a constant sequence, and the sum would just be n*a_1, which might not satisfy the given conditions. So, we can safely use the formula with r ≠ 1.Given that, let's write down the given information in terms of the formula.First, S_3 = 3. So,S_3 = a_1 * (1 - r^3) / (1 - r) = 3.  [Equation 1]Second, S_9 - S_6 = 12. Let me compute S_9 and S_6 using the formula.S_9 = a_1 * (1 - r^9) / (1 - r)S_6 = a_1 * (1 - r^6) / (1 - r)So, S_9 - S_6 = [a_1 * (1 - r^9) / (1 - r)] - [a_1 * (1 - r^6) / (1 - r)] = 12.Let me simplify that:S_9 - S_6 = [a_1 / (1 - r)] * [(1 - r^9) - (1 - r^6)] = 12Simplify inside the brackets:(1 - r^9) - (1 - r^6) = 1 - r^9 - 1 + r^6 = r^6 - r^9 = r^6(1 - r^3)So, S_9 - S_6 = [a_1 / (1 - r)] * r^6(1 - r^3) = 12Let me write that as:a_1 * r^6 * (1 - r^3) / (1 - r) = 12  [Equation 2]Now, looking back at Equation 1:a_1 * (1 - r^3) / (1 - r) = 3Notice that Equation 2 is similar to Equation 1, but multiplied by r^6.So, Equation 2 can be written as:[ a_1 * (1 - r^3) / (1 - r) ] * r^6 = 12But from Equation 1, we know that [ a_1 * (1 - r^3) / (1 - r) ] = 3. So, substituting that into Equation 2:3 * r^6 = 12So, 3r^6 = 12Divide both sides by 3:r^6 = 4So, r^6 = 4. Since r is positive, we can take the 6th root of both sides:r = 4^(1/6)Hmm, 4 is 2 squared, so 4^(1/6) = (2^2)^(1/6) = 2^(2/6) = 2^(1/3). So, r = 2^(1/3). Alternatively, r is the cube root of 2.So, r = ∛2.Alright, now that we have r, we can find a_1 from Equation 1.Equation 1: a_1 * (1 - r^3) / (1 - r) = 3Let me compute (1 - r^3) and (1 - r).Given that r = ∛2, so r^3 = (∛2)^3 = 2.So, 1 - r^3 = 1 - 2 = -1.1 - r = 1 - ∛2.So, plugging into Equation 1:a_1 * (-1) / (1 - ∛2) = 3Simplify:a_1 * (-1) / (1 - ∛2) = 3Multiply both sides by (1 - ∛2):a_1 * (-1) = 3 * (1 - ∛2)Multiply both sides by -1:a_1 = -3 * (1 - ∛2) = 3*(∛2 - 1)So, a_1 = 3*(∛2 - 1)Alright, now that we have a_1 and r, we can find S_6.S_6 = a_1 * (1 - r^6)/(1 - r)We already know that r^6 = 4, from earlier.So, S_6 = a_1 * (1 - 4)/(1 - r) = a_1 * (-3)/(1 - r)But let's compute it step by step.First, compute (1 - r^6):1 - r^6 = 1 - 4 = -3Then, 1 - r = 1 - ∛2So, S_6 = a_1 * (-3)/(1 - ∛2)But a_1 is 3*(∛2 - 1). So,S_6 = [3*(∛2 - 1)] * (-3)/(1 - ∛2)Let me simplify this expression.First, note that (∛2 - 1) is equal to -(1 - ∛2). Because:∛2 - 1 = -(1 - ∛2)So, substituting that in:S_6 = [3*(-(1 - ∛2))] * (-3)/(1 - ∛2)Simplify the numerator:3*(-(1 - ∛2)) * (-3) = 3*(1 - ∛2)*3 = 9*(1 - ∛2)So, S_6 = [9*(1 - ∛2)] / (1 - ∛2)The (1 - ∛2) terms cancel out, leaving S_6 = 9.Wait, that's nice. So, S_6 is 9.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Found that S_3 = 3 gives us Equation 1: a_1*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 3.2. Found that S_9 - S_6 = 12, which simplifies to a_1*r^6*(1 - r^3)/(1 - r) = 12.3. Noted that this is Equation 1 multiplied by r^6, so 3*r^6 = 12, leading to r^6 = 4, so r = 2^(1/3).4. Plugged r back into Equation 1 to find a_1:a_1 = 3*(∛2 - 1).5. Then, computed S_6 using the formula, which simplified to 9.Everything seems to check out. So, S_6 is 9.**Final Answer**The value of ( S_6 ) is boxed{9}."},{"question":"Given a+b=12 and a^{2}-b^{2}=48, find the value of a-b.","answer":"To find the value of ( a - b ) given the equations ( a + b = 12 ) and ( a^2 - b^2 = 48 ), I can use the difference of squares formula.First, I recognize that ( a^2 - b^2 ) can be factored into ( (a + b)(a - b) ). Substituting the known value of ( a + b ) into this expression gives:[48 = 12 times (a - b)]To solve for ( a - b ), I divide both sides of the equation by 12:[a - b = frac{48}{12} = 4]Thus, the value of ( a - b ) is 4."},{"question":"Lian, Marzuq, Rafsan, Arabi, Nabeel, and Rahul were in a 12-person race with 6 other people.

Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.f(x) = (1/2)(x + 1/x)g(x) = (1/2)(x - 1/x)Alright, part (1) asks me to find the zeros of the function h(x) = f(x) + 2g(x). Hmm, zeros mean the values of x where h(x) = 0. So I need to compute h(x) and then solve for x when h(x) equals zero.Let me compute h(x) first. Since h(x) is f(x) + 2g(x), I can substitute the expressions for f and g.So, h(x) = f(x) + 2g(x) = (1/2)(x + 1/x) + 2*(1/2)(x - 1/x)Simplify that. Let's compute each term:First term: (1/2)(x + 1/x)Second term: 2*(1/2)(x - 1/x) = (1)(x - 1/x) = x - 1/xSo, adding them together:h(x) = (1/2)(x + 1/x) + (x - 1/x)Let me combine these terms. To do that, I'll write them out:= (1/2)x + (1/2)(1/x) + x - (1/x)Now, combine like terms. Let's collect the x terms and the 1/x terms.For x terms: (1/2)x + x = (1/2 + 1)x = (3/2)xFor 1/x terms: (1/2)(1/x) - (1/x) = (1/2 - 1)(1/x) = (-1/2)(1/x)So, h(x) simplifies to:h(x) = (3/2)x - (1/2)(1/x)Now, to find the zeros, set h(x) = 0:(3/2)x - (1/2)(1/x) = 0Let me write that equation:(3/2)x - (1/2)(1/x) = 0I can multiply both sides by 2x to eliminate denominators. Let's do that:2x*(3/2)x - 2x*(1/2)(1/x) = 0*2xSimplify each term:First term: 2x*(3/2)x = 3x^2Second term: 2x*(1/2)(1/x) = (2x)*(1/(2x)) = 1So, the equation becomes:3x^2 - 1 = 0That's a quadratic equation. Let's solve for x^2:3x^2 = 1x^2 = 1/3So, x = sqrt(1/3) or x = -sqrt(1/3)Simplify sqrt(1/3): that's 1/sqrt(3) or sqrt(3)/3, but rationalized.So, x = sqrt(3)/3 or x = -sqrt(3)/3Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from h(x):h(x) = (3/2)x - (1/2)(1/x) = 0Multiply both sides by 2x:3x^2 - 1 = 0Yes, that's correct.So, x^2 = 1/3, so x = ±1/√3, which is ±√3/3.So, the zeros are at x = √3/3 and x = -√3/3.Wait, but I should check if these are valid in the original functions. Since f(x) and g(x) have 1/x, x cannot be zero. But √3/3 and -√3/3 are both non-zero, so they are valid.Alright, so part (1) is done. The zeros are at x = √3/3 and x = -√3/3.Now, moving on to part (2): Find the minimum value of the function F(x) = [f(x)]^{2n} - [g(x)]^{2n}, where n is a positive integer.Hmm, okay. So F(x) is expressed in terms of f(x) and g(x) raised to the power of 2n. Since n is a positive integer, 2n is an even positive integer, so both [f(x)]^{2n} and [g(x)]^{2n} are non-negative.I need to find the minimum value of F(x). So, perhaps I can express F(x) in terms of x, simplify it, and then find its minimum.Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between f(x) and g(x) to simplify F(x).Let me first compute [f(x)]^2 and [g(x)]^2, since F(x) is [f(x)]^{2n} - [g(x)]^{2n}, which can be factored as ([f(x)]^2)^n - ([g(x)]^2)^n.But maybe it's useful to compute [f(x)]^2 and [g(x)]^2 first.Compute [f(x)]^2:f(x) = (1/2)(x + 1/x), so [f(x)]^2 = (1/4)(x + 1/x)^2Similarly, [g(x)]^2 = (1/4)(x - 1/x)^2Let me compute both:[f(x)]^2 = (1/4)(x^2 + 2*(x)*(1/x) + (1/x)^2) = (1/4)(x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2)Similarly, [g(x)]^2 = (1/4)(x^2 - 2*(x)*(1/x) + (1/x)^2) = (1/4)(x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2)So, [f(x)]^2 = (x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2)/4[g(x)]^2 = (x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2)/4So, if I subtract [g(x)]^2 from [f(x)]^2:[f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 = [(x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2) - (x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2)] / 4Simplify numerator:x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2 - x^2 + 2 - 1/x^2 = (x^2 - x^2) + (2 + 2) + (1/x^2 - 1/x^2) = 4So, [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 = 4/4 = 1Interesting! So, [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 = 1 for all x ≠ 0.Therefore, F(x) = [f(x)]^{2n} - [g(x)]^{2n} can be written as ([f(x)]^2)^n - ([g(x)]^2)^nBut since [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 = 1, perhaps we can express [f(x)]^2 = [g(x)]^2 + 1Let me denote A = [f(x)]^2 and B = [g(x)]^2, so A - B = 1, so A = B + 1.Then, F(x) = A^n - B^nBut A = B + 1, so F(x) = (B + 1)^n - B^nHmm, so F(x) is expressed in terms of B, which is [g(x)]^2.But I need to find the minimum value of F(x). Since F(x) = (B + 1)^n - B^n, and B is [g(x)]^2, which is (1/4)(x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2). Let me compute B.Compute B:B = [g(x)]^2 = (1/4)(x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2)Let me denote y = x + 1/x. Wait, but f(x) is (1/2)(x + 1/x), so y = 2f(x). Alternatively, since I have x^2 + 1/x^2, which is (x + 1/x)^2 - 2.Wait, actually, x^2 + 1/x^2 = (x + 1/x)^2 - 2, yes.Similarly, x^2 - 1/x^2 = (x - 1/x)^2 - 2, but in B, we have x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2, which is (x^2 + 1/x^2) - 2, which is [(x + 1/x)^2 - 2] - 2 = (x + 1/x)^2 - 4.Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express B in terms of t = x + 1/x, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, since B is (1/4)(x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2), which is (1/4)( (x^2 + 1/x^2) - 2 ). Let me compute x^2 + 1/x^2.Let me denote t = x + 1/x, then t^2 = x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2, so x^2 + 1/x^2 = t^2 - 2.Therefore, x^2 + 1/x^2 = t^2 - 2, so x^2 + 1/x^2 - 2 = t^2 - 4.Therefore, B = (1/4)(t^2 - 4) = (t^2)/4 - 1.But t = x + 1/x, and f(x) = t/2, so t = 2f(x). So, t^2 = 4[f(x)]^2.Therefore, B = (4[f(x)]^2)/4 - 1 = [f(x)]^2 - 1.But we already know that [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 = 1, so [f(x)]^2 = [g(x)]^2 + 1, so B = [g(x)]^2 = [f(x)]^2 - 1.Wait, that seems consistent.But I'm trying to find F(x) = [f(x)]^{2n} - [g(x)]^{2n} = A^n - B^n, where A = B + 1.So, F(x) = (B + 1)^n - B^n.I need to find the minimum of F(x). Since F(x) is expressed in terms of B, which is [g(x)]^2, which is (1/4)(x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2). Let me analyze B.Compute B:B = (1/4)(x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2) = (1/4)(x^2 + 1/x^2 - 2)But x^2 + 1/x^2 is always greater than or equal to 2, because by AM ≥ GM, x^2 + 1/x^2 ≥ 2*sqrt(x^2 * 1/x^2) = 2.So, x^2 + 1/x^2 ≥ 2, so x^2 + 1/x^2 - 2 ≥ 0, so B = (1/4)(something ≥ 0) ≥ 0.Therefore, B is non-negative. So, B ≥ 0.Moreover, the minimum value of x^2 + 1/x^2 is 2, achieved when x^2 = 1/x^2, i.e., x^2 = 1, so x = 1 or x = -1.Therefore, the minimum value of B is (1/4)(2 - 2) = 0.Wait, no, wait. Wait, x^2 + 1/x^2 - 2 is (x - 1/x)^2, which is always non-negative, and it's zero when x = 1/x, so x^2 = 1, so x = 1 or x = -1.Therefore, B = (1/4)(x - 1/x)^2, which is always non-negative, and it's zero when x = 1 or x = -1.So, B can take any value from 0 to infinity, depending on x.Therefore, in F(x) = (B + 1)^n - B^n, B is in [0, ∞).So, to find the minimum of F(x), we can consider F as a function of B, where B ≥ 0.So, let me define F(B) = (B + 1)^n - B^n, for B ≥ 0.We need to find the minimum value of F(B) over B ≥ 0.So, perhaps we can analyze F(B) as a function of B.Compute derivative of F(B) with respect to B:F'(B) = n(B + 1)^{n - 1} - nB^{n - 1}Set derivative equal to zero to find critical points:n(B + 1)^{n - 1} - nB^{n - 1} = 0Divide both sides by n (since n ≠ 0):(B + 1)^{n - 1} - B^{n - 1} = 0So, (B + 1)^{n - 1} = B^{n - 1}Take both sides to the power of 1/(n - 1):B + 1 = BWait, that would imply 1 = 0, which is impossible.Hmm, that suggests that there are no critical points where the derivative is zero, except perhaps at B = 0.Wait, let me check the derivative again.F'(B) = n(B + 1)^{n - 1} - nB^{n - 1}So, F'(B) = n[(B + 1)^{n - 1} - B^{n - 1}]Set equal to zero:(B + 1)^{n - 1} = B^{n - 1}If n - 1 is positive, which it is because n is a positive integer (n ≥ 1), so n - 1 ≥ 0.Case 1: n = 1If n = 1, then F(B) = (B + 1) - B = 1, which is constant. So, the minimum is 1.But n is in N*, so n ≥ 1, including n = 1.But let's check for n ≥ 2.For n ≥ 2, n - 1 ≥ 1, so the function (B + 1)^{n - 1} is strictly increasing, and B^{n - 1} is also strictly increasing.But (B + 1)^{n - 1} > B^{n - 1} for all B ≥ 0, because B + 1 > B.Therefore, F'(B) = n[(B + 1)^{n - 1} - B^{n - 1}] > 0 for all B ≥ 0.So, F(B) is strictly increasing for B ≥ 0 when n ≥ 2.Therefore, the minimum of F(B) occurs at the minimum value of B, which is B = 0.So, when B = 0, F(B) = (0 + 1)^n - 0^n = 1 - 0 = 1.Therefore, for n ≥ 1, the minimum value of F(x) is 1.Wait, but let me verify this with n = 1.If n = 1, F(x) = [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2, which we already found is 1. So, indeed, it's constant, so the minimum is 1.For n = 2, F(x) = [f(x)]^4 - [g(x)]^4.But since [f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2 = 1, let me compute [f(x)]^4 - [g(x)]^4.It's equal to ([f(x)]^2)^2 - ([g(x)]^2)^2 = ([f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2)([f(x)]^2 + [g(x)]^2) = 1*( [f(x)]^2 + [g(x)]^2 )So, F(x) = [f(x)]^2 + [g(x)]^2But [f(x)]^2 + [g(x)]^2 = (x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2)/4 + (x^2 - 2 + 1/x^2)/4 = [2x^2 + 2/x^2]/4 = (x^2 + 1/x^2)/2So, F(x) = (x^2 + 1/x^2)/2Which is equal to (x + 1/x)^2 / 2 - 1, but wait, actually, (x^2 + 1/x^2)/2 is equal to [ (x + 1/x)^2 - 2 ] / 2 = [ (2f(x))^2 - 2 ] / 2 = [4f(x)^2 - 2]/2 = 2f(x)^2 - 1But regardless, (x^2 + 1/x^2)/2 is always greater than or equal to 1, since x^2 + 1/x^2 ≥ 2, so divided by 2 is ≥ 1.Therefore, F(x) = [f(x)]^4 - [g(x)]^4 = (x^2 + 1/x^2)/2 ≥ 1, with equality when x^2 + 1/x^2 = 2, which is when x = 1 or x = -1.So, the minimum is indeed 1.Similarly, for higher n, since F(B) is increasing in B, and B ≥ 0, the minimum occurs at B = 0, which corresponds to x = 1 or x = -1, giving F(x) = 1.Therefore, regardless of n, the minimum value of F(x) is 1.Wait, but let me test n = 3 just to be thorough.For n = 3, F(x) = [f(x)]^6 - [g(x)]^6But [f(x)]^6 - [g(x)]^6 can be factored as ([f(x)]^2)^3 - ([g(x)]^2)^3 = (A)^3 - (B)^3 = (A - B)(A^2 + AB + B^2)We know A - B = 1, so F(x) = 1*(A^2 + AB + B^2) = A^2 + AB + B^2But A = [f(x)]^2, B = [g(x)]^2, and A = B + 1.So, substitute A = B + 1:F(x) = (B + 1)^2 + (B + 1)B + B^2Expand:= (B^2 + 2B + 1) + (B^2 + B) + B^2= B^2 + 2B + 1 + B^2 + B + B^2= 3B^2 + 3B + 1Now, since B ≥ 0, this is a quadratic in B, opening upwards. The minimum occurs at B = -3/(2*3) = -0.5, but since B ≥ 0, the minimum is at B = 0.So, F(x) at B = 0 is 3*0 + 3*0 + 1 = 1.Therefore, the minimum is 1.So, this seems consistent.Therefore, for any positive integer n, the minimum value of F(x) is 1.Hence, the answer for part (2) is 1.**Final Answer**(1) The zeros of ( h(x) ) are (boxed{pm dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}}).(2) The minimum value of ( F(x) ) is (boxed{1})."},{"question":"How many ordered pairs of integers  (m,n)  are there such that  m  and  n  are the legs of a right triangle with an area equal to a prime number not exceeding  80 ?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that m and n are the legs of a right triangle with an area equal to a prime number not exceeding 80. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First off, I know that in a right triangle, the area is given by (1/2)*base*height. Since m and n are the legs, they act as the base and height. So, the area would be (1/2)*m*n. The problem states that this area has to be a prime number that doesn't exceed 80. So, essentially, (1/2)*m*n should be a prime number less than or equal to 80.Let me write that down:Area = (1/2)*m*n = p, where p is a prime number and p ≤ 80.So, rearranging that, we get m*n = 2p.Since m and n are integers, their product must be twice a prime number. Now, prime numbers have only two positive divisors: 1 and themselves. So, 2p would have divisors 1, 2, p, and 2p. Therefore, the possible pairs (m, n) would be the pairs of positive integers whose product is 2p. But since m and n are legs of a triangle, they can be positive or negative integers? Wait, hold on. The legs of a triangle can't be negative because lengths can't be negative. So, m and n must be positive integers.Therefore, m and n are positive integers such that m*n = 2p, where p is a prime number ≤80.So, for each prime p ≤80, I can find the number of ordered pairs (m, n) such that m*n = 2p. Since m and n are positive integers, the number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2p. But since 2p is a product of two primes (2 and p), the number of positive divisors is (1+1)*(1+1) = 4. So, for each prime p, there are 4 ordered pairs (m, n).But wait, hold on. Let me think again. If 2p is the product, and p is prime, then the divisors are 1, 2, p, and 2p. So, the possible pairs (m, n) would be (1, 2p), (2, p), (p, 2), and (2p, 1). So, yes, 4 ordered pairs for each prime p.However, the problem is asking for ordered pairs, so (m, n) and (n, m) are considered different if m ≠ n. So, in this case, since all these pairs are distinct unless m = n, but in our case, since 2p is not a square (unless p=2, but 2p=4, which is a square, but p=2 is prime. Wait, let's see.Wait, if p=2, then 2p=4, which is a square. So, in that case, the divisors would be 1, 2, 4. Wait, no, 4 is 2 squared, so the number of divisors is 3: 1, 2, 4. So, the number of ordered pairs would be 3, because (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). But in our case, p=2 is a prime, so 2p=4, and the pairs would be (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). So, three ordered pairs.But wait, earlier I thought for each prime p, we have 4 ordered pairs, but for p=2, we have only 3. So, maybe I need to adjust for that.Wait, let's think again. 2p is the product. If p is an odd prime, then 2p is 2 times an odd number, which is not a square. So, 2p is not a square when p is an odd prime. So, for p=2, 2p=4 is a square, so the number of ordered pairs is 3, but for other primes, it's 4. So, perhaps I need to count p=2 separately.So, first, let's list all prime numbers less than or equal to 80.Primes ≤80 are:2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79.Let me count them:2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79.That's 22 primes in total.So, for each of these primes, except p=2, the number of ordered pairs is 4, and for p=2, it's 3. So, total number of ordered pairs would be 21*4 + 1*3 = 84 + 3 = 87.But wait, hold on. Let me make sure.Wait, the area is (1/2)*m*n = p, so m*n = 2p. So, for each prime p, m and n are positive integers such that m*n=2p. So, the number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2p, considering order.Since 2p is either 4 (when p=2) or 2 times an odd prime.So, for p=2, 2p=4, which has divisors 1,2,4. So, the ordered pairs are (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). So, 3 ordered pairs.For p=3, 2p=6, which has divisors 1,2,3,6. So, ordered pairs: (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). So, 4 ordered pairs.Similarly, for p=5, 2p=10, which has divisors 1,2,5,10. So, 4 ordered pairs.Same for all other primes, since 2p is not a square, so the number of ordered pairs is 4.Therefore, total number of ordered pairs is 3 (for p=2) + 4*(22-1) = 3 + 4*21 = 3 + 84 = 87.Wait, but hold on. The problem says \\"ordered pairs of integers (m,n)\\", so m and n can be positive or negative? Hmm, the legs of a triangle are lengths, so they have to be positive. So, m and n must be positive integers. So, negative values are not allowed.Therefore, we don't have to consider negative divisors. So, the count is as above: 3 + 4*21 = 87.But wait, let me think again. If m and n are positive integers, then the number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2p, considering order.So, for p=2, 2p=4, which has 3 positive divisors, so 3 ordered pairs.For p≠2, 2p is 2 times an odd prime, which has 4 positive divisors, so 4 ordered pairs.Therefore, total ordered pairs: 3 + 4*(22-1) = 3 + 84 = 87.But wait, let me make sure that 2p is indeed 2 times a prime, so 2p is not a square except when p=2, which gives 4.So, that seems correct.But let me cross-verify.Alternatively, the area is (1/2)*m*n = p, so m*n = 2p.So, for each prime p, the number of ordered pairs (m,n) is equal to the number of ordered pairs of positive integers (m,n) such that m*n=2p.Since 2p is a positive integer, the number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2p. Since 2p is either 4 or 2 times an odd prime, the number of positive divisors is 3 or 4, respectively.So, for p=2, 2p=4, which has 3 positive divisors, so 3 ordered pairs.For p≠2, 2p has 4 positive divisors, so 4 ordered pairs.Therefore, total number of ordered pairs is 3 + 4*(22-1) = 3 + 84 = 87.But wait, hold on. Let me think about whether m and n can be zero or not. But legs of a triangle can't be zero, so m and n must be positive integers greater than zero.Therefore, our initial reasoning holds.But wait, let me think about p=2. So, for p=2, m*n=4. So, the ordered pairs are (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). So, three ordered pairs.Similarly, for p=3, m*n=6. The ordered pairs are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). So, four ordered pairs.Same for p=5, m*n=10: (1,10), (2,5), (5,2), (10,1). Four ordered pairs.So, yeah, this seems consistent.So, the total number of ordered pairs is 87.But wait, hold on. Let me recount the number of primes less than or equal to 80.Primes less than or equal to 80 are:2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79.Let me count them:1. 22. 33. 54. 75. 116. 137. 178. 199. 2310. 2911. 3112. 3713. 4114. 4315. 4716. 5317. 5918. 6119. 6720. 7121. 7322. 79Yes, 22 primes in total.So, for p=2, 3 ordered pairs.For the remaining 21 primes, each contributes 4 ordered pairs.So, total ordered pairs: 3 + (21*4) = 3 + 84 = 87.Therefore, the answer is 87.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Is 87 the correct count?Wait, another way to think about it is that for each prime p, the number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of ordered pairs (d, 2p/d), where d is a positive divisor of 2p.Since 2p has either 3 or 4 positive divisors, as we saw.So, for each prime p, the number of ordered pairs is equal to the number of positive divisors of 2p, which is 3 if p=2, else 4.Therefore, the total number of ordered pairs is 3 + 4*(22-1) = 87.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (m,n) is 87.**Final Answer**The number of ordered pairs is boxed{87}."},{"question":"In a magic triangle, each of the six [whole numbers](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Whole_number) 10-15 is placed in one of the [circles](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Circle) so that the sum, S, of the three numbers on each side of the [triangle](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Triangle) is the same.

Each side of the triangle has three circles, and the sum of the numbers on each side should be the same, denoted as S. The question is asking for the largest possible value of S, and the options are from 36 to 40.First, I need to visualize the triangle. The Asymptote code draws a triangle with circles on each vertex and along each side. So, there are six circles in total, each to be filled with numbers 10 through 15. Each side of the triangle consists of three circles: one at each end (which are shared with adjacent sides) and one in the middle of the side. So, each vertex circle is part of two sides, and each middle circle is part of only one side.Let me try to sketch this mentally. There are three vertices, each with a circle, and three sides, each with a middle circle. So, the six circles are: three at the vertices (let's call them A, B, C) and three on the sides (let's call them D, E, F). Each side of the triangle will then be A + D + B, B + E + C, and C + F + A. So, each side sum S is equal to the sum of two vertex numbers and one middle number.Wait, actually, hold on. If each side has three circles, and the triangle has three sides, but there are six circles in total, that means each side shares a circle with another side. So, each vertex is shared by two sides. So, each side is made up of two vertex circles and one middle circle. So, each side sum S is equal to two vertex numbers plus one middle number.Therefore, the three sides would be:- Side 1: A + D + B- Side 2: B + E + C- Side 3: C + F + ASo, each side has two vertices and one middle circle. Therefore, each vertex is part of two sides, and each middle circle is part of only one side.Given that, the total sum of all sides would be 3S, because each side is S and there are three sides. But, when we add up all three sides, we are counting each vertex twice (since each vertex is in two sides) and each middle circle once. So, the total sum is 2*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 3S.But the numbers 10 to 15 are all used, so A, B, C, D, E, F are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 in some order. Therefore, the sum of all numbers is 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15. Let me compute that:10 + 15 = 2511 + 14 = 2512 + 13 = 25So, total sum is 25 + 25 + 25 = 75.So, 2*(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 3SBut since A + B + C + D + E + F = 75, so (D + E + F) = 75 - (A + B + C)Substituting into the first equation:2*(A + B + C) + (75 - (A + B + C)) = 3SSimplify:2*(A + B + C) + 75 - (A + B + C) = 3SWhich is (2*(A + B + C) - (A + B + C)) + 75 = 3SSo, (A + B + C) + 75 = 3STherefore, 3S = (A + B + C) + 75So, S = [(A + B + C) + 75] / 3Simplify:S = (A + B + C)/3 + 25So, S is equal to the average of the vertex numbers plus 25.Since we need the largest possible S, we need to maximize (A + B + C). Because S is directly dependent on (A + B + C). So, to maximize S, we need to maximize the sum of the vertex numbers.Given that all numbers from 10 to 15 are used, and A, B, C are three of them, so to maximize (A + B + C), we should assign the largest numbers to the vertices.The numbers 10 to 15: the largest three are 13, 14, 15.So, if we set A, B, C as 13, 14, 15, then (A + B + C) = 13 + 14 + 15 = 42.Therefore, S = 42/3 + 25 = 14 + 25 = 39.Wait, but hold on. Let me verify that.If A, B, C are 13, 14, 15, then D, E, F are 10, 11, 12.So, substituting back into the sides:Side 1: A + D + B = 13 + 10 + 14 = 37Side 2: B + E + C = 14 + 11 + 15 = 40Side 3: C + F + A = 15 + 12 + 13 = 40Wait, that's inconsistent. The sums are 37, 40, 40. So, they are not equal. So, that doesn't work.Hmm, so just assigning the largest numbers to the vertices doesn't necessarily give equal sums on each side. So, my initial thought was wrong. I need to ensure that each side sums to S, so I can't just arbitrarily assign the largest numbers to the vertices.So, perhaps I need a different approach.Let me think again.We have:3S = (A + B + C) + 75So, S = (A + B + C)/3 + 25Therefore, to maximize S, we need to maximize (A + B + C). So, the maximum possible (A + B + C) is 13 + 14 + 15 = 42, as before.But as we saw, assigning 13,14,15 to A,B,C doesn't necessarily lead to equal sides.So, perhaps we need to arrange the numbers such that the sums on each side are equal, even if that means not all the largest numbers are on the vertices.Alternatively, maybe we can have some of the larger numbers on the vertices and some on the sides, but arranged in such a way that each side sums to the same S.Let me think about the constraints.Each side is A + D + B, B + E + C, C + F + A.So, each side has two vertices and one side number.Since each vertex is part of two sides, the numbers on the vertices will influence two sides each.So, if a vertex has a high number, it will contribute to two sides, potentially making both sides larger.Similarly, if a side has a high number, it only affects one side.Therefore, to maximize S, we might want to have the larger numbers on the vertices so that their contribution is spread across two sides, allowing each side to have a higher sum.But as we saw earlier, just putting the largest numbers on the vertices doesn't necessarily balance the sides.So, perhaps a better approach is to set up equations.Let me denote:Let A, B, C be the vertex numbers, and D, E, F be the side numbers.So, we have:A + D + B = SB + E + C = SC + F + A = SWe also know that A, B, C, D, E, F are 10,11,12,13,14,15 in some order.So, let's write the three equations:1) A + B + D = S2) B + C + E = S3) C + A + F = SIf we add all three equations:(A + B + D) + (B + C + E) + (C + A + F) = 3SSimplify:2A + 2B + 2C + D + E + F = 3SBut we know that A + B + C + D + E + F = 75, so D + E + F = 75 - (A + B + C)Substituting back:2(A + B + C) + (75 - (A + B + C)) = 3SWhich simplifies to:(A + B + C) + 75 = 3SSo, S = (A + B + C + 75)/3Which is the same as before.So, to maximize S, we need to maximize (A + B + C). The maximum possible is 13 + 14 + 15 = 42.So, S = (42 + 75)/3 = 117/3 = 39.So, the maximum possible S is 39.But earlier, when I tried assigning A=13, B=14, C=15, and D=10, E=11, F=12, the sums were 37, 40, 40, which are unequal.Therefore, even though (A + B + C) is 42, the side sums are unequal, so that arrangement doesn't work.Therefore, we need to find an arrangement where A, B, C are 13,14,15, but arranged such that D, E, F are 10,11,12, and each side sums to 39.So, let's see.We have:A + B + D = 39B + C + E = 39C + A + F = 39Given that A, B, C are 13,14,15, and D, E, F are 10,11,12.Let me denote A, B, C as 13,14,15, but we don't know which is which.So, let's try assigning A=13, B=14, C=15.Then:First equation: 13 + 14 + D = 39 => D = 39 - 27 = 12Second equation: 14 + 15 + E = 39 => E = 39 - 29 = 10Third equation: 15 + 13 + F = 39 => F = 39 - 28 = 11So, D=12, E=10, F=11.So, D, E, F would be 12,10,11, which are exactly the remaining numbers.So, let's check the sides:Side 1: A + D + B = 13 + 12 + 14 = 39Side 2: B + E + C = 14 + 10 + 15 = 39Side 3: C + F + A = 15 + 11 + 13 = 39Yes, that works! So, in this arrangement, each side sums to 39.Therefore, the largest possible value of S is 39.Wait, but hold on. Let me check if there's another arrangement where S could be higher.Suppose we try to assign A=14, B=15, C=13.Then:First equation: 14 + 15 + D = 39 => D = 39 - 29 = 10Second equation: 15 + 13 + E = 39 => E = 39 - 28 = 11Third equation: 13 + 14 + F = 39 => F = 39 - 27 = 12So, D=10, E=11, F=12.Again, sides:Side 1: 14 + 10 + 15 = 39Side 2: 15 + 11 + 13 = 39Side 3: 13 + 12 + 14 = 39Same result.Alternatively, if we assign A=15, B=13, C=14.First equation: 15 + 13 + D = 39 => D = 11Second equation: 13 + 14 + E = 39 => E = 12Third equation: 14 + 15 + F = 39 => F = 10So, D=11, E=12, F=10.Sides:15 + 11 + 13 = 3913 + 12 + 14 = 3914 + 10 + 15 = 39Still works.So, regardless of how we assign A, B, C as 13,14,15, as long as D, E, F are assigned appropriately, we can get each side to sum to 39.Therefore, 39 is achievable.But wait, is 40 achievable? Let's check.Suppose we try to make S=40.Then, from S = (A + B + C)/3 + 25, so 40 = (A + B + C)/3 + 25 => (A + B + C)/3 = 15 => A + B + C = 45.But the maximum possible A + B + C is 13 + 14 + 15 = 42. So, 45 is impossible.Therefore, 40 is not achievable.So, 39 is the maximum possible S.Hence, the answer is D) 39.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"A relatively prime date is a date for which the number of the month and the number of the day are relatively prime. For example, June 17 is a relatively prime date because the greatest common factor of 6 and 17 is 1. How many relatively prime dates are in the month with the fewest relatively prime dates?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about relatively prime dates. Hmm, let me try to understand it. A relatively prime date is when the month number and the day number have a greatest common factor (GCF) of 1. For example, June is the 6th month, and June 17 is a relatively prime date because GCF of 6 and 17 is 1. Got it.The question is asking: How many relatively prime dates are in the month with the fewest relatively prime dates? So, I need to figure out for each month, how many days in that month are relatively prime to the month number, and then find the month with the smallest number of such days.Alright, so first, I need to know the number of days in each month. I remember that:- January: 31- February: 28 (assuming it's not a leap year)- March: 31- April: 30- May: 31- June: 30- July: 31- August: 31- September: 30- October: 31- November: 30- December: 31Wait, let me confirm that. Yeah, that seems right. So, months alternate between 31, 30, 31, etc., except February which is 28 or 29. Since the problem doesn't specify a year, I think we can assume 28 days for February.Now, for each month, I need to count how many days are relatively prime to the month number. Let's list the months with their numbers:1. January - 12. February - 23. March - 34. April - 45. May - 56. June - 67. July - 78. August - 89. September - 910. October - 1011. November - 1112. December - 12So, for each of these, I need to compute the number of days (from 1 to the number of days in the month) that are relatively prime to the month number.I think the best way to approach this is to use Euler's Totient Function, φ(n), which gives the number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. But wait, φ(n) counts numbers from 1 to n, but in our case, the number of days can be more than n, depending on the month. For example, January has 31 days, but the month number is 1. So, for January, every day is relatively prime because GCF(1, any number) is 1. So, January would have 31 relatively prime dates.But for other months, like February (month 2), which has 28 days, we need to count how many days from 1 to 28 are coprime with 2. Similarly, March (month 3) has 31 days, so we need to count numbers from 1 to 31 coprime with 3, and so on.Wait, so maybe for months where the number of days is greater than the month number, we can't directly use φ(n), but we can use the concept. Because φ(n) counts numbers up to n, but we have more days. So, perhaps we can compute the number of integers from 1 to D (days in the month) that are coprime to M (month number). So, it's like φ(M) scaled up to D.But actually, for numbers beyond M, the coprimality repeats every M numbers. So, the density of coprime numbers is φ(M)/M. So, the number of coprime numbers up to D would be approximately (D / M) * φ(M). But since D might not be a multiple of M, we might have some remainder.Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as floor(D / M) * φ(M) + φ(remainder), where remainder is D mod M. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.Wait, actually, the number of integers ≤ D that are coprime to M is equal to sum_{k=1 to D} [gcd(k, M) = 1]. This can be calculated using inclusion-exclusion based on the prime factors of M.Alternatively, since M is the month number, which is between 1 and 12, it's manageable to compute manually for each month.Let me try to make a table for each month:1. **January (1)**: All days are coprime because GCF(1, any number) is 1. So, 31 days.2. **February (2)**: Days are 1 to 28. We need to count numbers coprime with 2, which are the odd numbers. So, from 1 to 28, half are odd. 28 / 2 = 14. So, 14 days.3. **March (3)**: Days 1 to 31. Numbers coprime with 3 are numbers not divisible by 3. So, total days = 31. Numbers divisible by 3: floor(31/3) = 10 (since 3*10=30). So, coprime numbers = 31 - 10 = 21.4. **April (4)**: Days 1 to 30. Numbers coprime with 4 are numbers not divisible by 2 (since 4's prime factor is 2). So, similar to February, the odd numbers. 30 days, half are odd: 15 days.Wait, but 4 is 2^2, so numbers coprime to 4 are numbers not divisible by 2. So, same as February, 15 days.5. **May (5)**: Days 1 to 31. Numbers coprime with 5 are numbers not divisible by 5. So, total days =31. Numbers divisible by 5: floor(31/5)=6 (since 5*6=30). So, coprime numbers=31-6=25.6. **June (6)**: Days 1 to 30. Numbers coprime with 6. Since 6=2*3, numbers not divisible by 2 or 3. Let's compute using inclusion-exclusion.Total numbers:30Numbers divisible by 2:15Numbers divisible by 3:10Numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., 6):5So, numbers divisible by 2 or 3:15+10-5=20Thus, numbers coprime with 6:30-20=10.Wait, that seems low. Let me check:Alternatively, φ(6)=2, so the density is 2/6=1/3. So, 30*(1/3)=10. Yeah, that matches.7. **July (7)**: Days 1 to 31. Numbers coprime with 7 are numbers not divisible by 7. So, total days=31. Numbers divisible by7: floor(31/7)=4 (since 7*4=28). So, coprime numbers=31-4=27.8. **August (8)**: Days 1 to 31. Numbers coprime with 8. Since 8=2^3, numbers not divisible by 2. So, odd numbers. 31 days, half are odd, but 31 is odd, so 16 days.Wait, 31/2=15.5, so 16 odd days.9. **September (9)**: Days 1 to 30. Numbers coprime with 9. Since 9=3^2, numbers not divisible by 3. So, total days=30. Numbers divisible by3:10. So, coprime numbers=30-10=20.10. **October (10)**: Days 1 to 31. Numbers coprime with 10. 10=2*5, so numbers not divisible by 2 or 5.Using inclusion-exclusion:Total numbers:31Numbers divisible by2:15Numbers divisible by5:6Numbers divisible by both2 and5 (i.e.,10):3So, numbers divisible by2 or5:15+6-3=18Thus, numbers coprime with10:31-18=13.Alternatively, φ(10)=4, density=4/10=0.4, 31*0.4≈12.4, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 13.11. **November (11)**: Days 1 to 30. Numbers coprime with11. Since 11 is prime, numbers not divisible by11. So, total days=30. Numbers divisible by11:2 (11 and22). So, coprime numbers=30-2=28.12. **December (12)**: Days 1 to31. Numbers coprime with12. 12=2^2*3, so numbers not divisible by2 or3.Using inclusion-exclusion:Total numbers:31Numbers divisible by2:15Numbers divisible by3:10Numbers divisible by both2 and3 (i.e.,6):5So, numbers divisible by2 or3:15+10-5=20Thus, numbers coprime with12:31-20=11.Alternatively, φ(12)=4, density=4/12=1/3, 31*(1/3)≈10.33, so 10 or11. Since 31 is not a multiple of12, we have to compute exactly, which gives11.Wait, let me verify:Numbers coprime with12 from1-31:Numbers not divisible by2 or3.Total numbers:31Numbers divisible by2:15Numbers divisible by3:10Numbers divisible by both:5So, numbers divisible by2 or3:15+10-5=20Thus, coprime numbers:31-20=11. Yes, correct.So, compiling all the counts:1. January:312. February:143. March:214. April:155. May:256. June:107. July:278. August:169. September:2010. October:1311. November:2812. December:11Now, looking for the month with the fewest relatively prime dates. So, the counts are:31,14,21,15,25,10,27,16,20,13,28,11.Looking for the smallest number here.Looking at the numbers:10 is the smallest. So, June has 10 relatively prime dates.Wait, let me double-check June:June is month6, which has30 days.Numbers coprime with6 are numbers not divisible by2 or3.From1-30, numbers not divisible by2 or3.Total numbers:30Numbers divisible by2:15Numbers divisible by3:10Numbers divisible by both:5So, numbers divisible by2 or3:15+10-5=20Thus, coprime numbers:30-20=10. Yes, that's correct.So, the fewest is10, in June.Wait, but let me check other months with lower counts. For example, February has14, which is higher than10. April has15, higher. October has13, higher. December has11, higher. So, yes, June is the month with the fewest, which is10.Therefore, the answer is10.**Final Answer**The month with the fewest relatively prime dates has boxed{10} such dates."},{"question":"Let a and b be real numbers.  Find the maximum value of a cos theta + b sin theta in terms of a and b.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the expression ( a cos theta + b sin theta ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are real numbers. Hmm, I remember something about this from trigonometry. Maybe it's related to the amplitude of a sinusoidal function? Let me think.First, I recall that expressions like ( a cos theta + b sin theta ) can be rewritten in the form ( R cos(theta - phi) ) or ( R sin(theta + phi) ) for some ( R ) and ( phi ). That might be helpful because the maximum value of a cosine or sine function is 1, so multiplying by ( R ) would give the maximum as ( R ). So, if I can express the original expression in terms of a single trigonometric function, the maximum should be straightforward.Let me try to express ( a cos theta + b sin theta ) as ( R cos(theta - phi) ). Using the cosine of a difference identity, we have:[R cos(theta - phi) = R cos theta cos phi + R sin theta sin phi]Comparing this with the original expression ( a cos theta + b sin theta ), we can equate the coefficients:[a = R cos phi][b = R sin phi]So, from these two equations, we can solve for ( R ) and ( phi ). Let's square both equations and add them together:[a^2 + b^2 = (R cos phi)^2 + (R sin phi)^2 = R^2 (cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi) = R^2]Since ( cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi = 1 ), this simplifies to:[a^2 + b^2 = R^2]Therefore, ( R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). So, the expression ( a cos theta + b sin theta ) can be rewritten as ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cos(theta - phi) ). Now, since the maximum value of ( cos(theta - phi) ) is 1, the maximum value of the entire expression is ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} times 1 = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Is there another way to verify this result? Maybe using calculus. Let's consider the function ( f(theta) = a cos theta + b sin theta ). To find its maximum, we can take the derivative with respect to ( theta ) and set it equal to zero.So, ( f'(theta) = -a sin theta + b cos theta ). Setting this equal to zero:[-a sin theta + b cos theta = 0][b cos theta = a sin theta][frac{sin theta}{cos theta} = frac{b}{a}][tan theta = frac{b}{a}]So, ( theta = arctanleft( frac{b}{a} right) ). Let's plug this back into the original function to find the maximum value.First, compute ( cos theta ) and ( sin theta ) where ( theta = arctanleft( frac{b}{a} right) ). Imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is ( b ) and the adjacent side is ( a ). Then, the hypotenuse is ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).Therefore,[cos theta = frac{a}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}][sin theta = frac{b}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}]Substituting back into ( f(theta) ):[f(theta) = a cdot frac{a}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} + b cdot frac{b}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = frac{a^2 + b^2}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}]Okay, that matches the result I got earlier. So, both methods give the same maximum value. That makes me more confident that the maximum value is indeed ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).Is there another way to think about this? Maybe geometrically. The expression ( a cos theta + b sin theta ) can be interpreted as the dot product of two vectors: ( (a, b) ) and ( (cos theta, sin theta) ). The dot product is equal to the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them. So,[(a, b) cdot (cos theta, sin theta) = |(a, b)| cdot |(cos theta, sin theta)| cdot cos phi]where ( phi ) is the angle between the two vectors. The magnitude of ( (a, b) ) is ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ), and the magnitude of ( (cos theta, sin theta) ) is 1 because it's a unit vector. So, the dot product simplifies to:[sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot 1 cdot cos phi = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cos phi]The maximum value of this expression occurs when ( cos phi ) is maximized, which is 1. Therefore, the maximum value is ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).Wow, that's a neat geometric interpretation. So, the maximum value is essentially the magnitude of the vector ( (a, b) ). That makes sense because the dot product is maximized when the two vectors are in the same direction.Let me summarize the different approaches I've considered:1. **Trigonometric Identity Method**: Rewriting the expression using a cosine of a difference identity, leading to ( R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ) as the amplitude, hence the maximum value.2. **Calculus Method**: Taking the derivative, finding critical points, and substituting back to find the maximum value, which also results in ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).3. **Geometric Interpretation**: Viewing the expression as a dot product and using vector magnitudes and angles to determine the maximum value.All three methods converge to the same result, so I'm pretty confident that the maximum value of ( a cos theta + b sin theta ) is ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).Just to be thorough, let me test this with specific values. Suppose ( a = 3 ) and ( b = 4 ). Then, the maximum value should be ( sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 ). Let's see if that's the case.Compute ( 3 cos theta + 4 sin theta ). If I choose ( theta ) such that ( cos theta = 3/5 ) and ( sin theta = 4/5 ), then the expression becomes ( 3*(3/5) + 4*(4/5) = 9/5 + 16/5 = 25/5 = 5 ). Perfect, that's the maximum.Alternatively, if I choose ( theta = 0 ), then the expression is ( 3*1 + 4*0 = 3 ), which is less than 5. If I choose ( theta = pi/2 ), it's ( 3*0 + 4*1 = 4 ), still less than 5. So, the maximum is indeed 5.Another test case: ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ). Then, the maximum should be ( sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2} ). Let's compute ( cos theta + sin theta ) at ( theta = pi/4 ). Then, ( cos pi/4 = sin pi/4 = sqrt{2}/2 ), so the expression becomes ( sqrt{2}/2 + sqrt{2}/2 = sqrt{2} ). Correct again.What if one of them is zero? Let's say ( a = 5 ), ( b = 0 ). Then, the expression is ( 5 cos theta ), whose maximum is 5, which is ( sqrt{5^2 + 0^2} = 5 ). Similarly, if ( a = 0 ), ( b = 7 ), the expression is ( 7 sin theta ), whose maximum is 7, which is ( sqrt{0^2 + 7^2} = 7 ). So, that works too.What about negative values? Let's take ( a = -3 ), ( b = 4 ). The maximum should still be ( sqrt{(-3)^2 + 4^2} = 5 ). Let's compute ( -3 cos theta + 4 sin theta ). If I choose ( theta ) such that ( cos theta = -3/5 ) and ( sin theta = 4/5 ), then the expression becomes ( -3*(-3/5) + 4*(4/5) = 9/5 + 16/5 = 25/5 = 5 ). Perfect, still works.So, regardless of the signs of ( a ) and ( b ), the maximum value remains ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). That makes sense because squaring eliminates the sign, and the maximum is about the magnitude, not the direction.Is there a case where this might not hold? Hmm, if ( a ) and ( b ) are both zero, then the expression is zero for all ( theta ). So, the maximum is zero, which is ( sqrt{0 + 0} = 0 ). That's consistent.What if ( a ) and ( b ) are not real numbers? Wait, the problem states that ( a ) and ( b ) are real numbers, so I don't need to consider complex cases here.Just to recap, the key steps were:1. Recognize that ( a cos theta + b sin theta ) can be expressed as a single sinusoidal function with amplitude ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).2. Alternatively, use calculus to find the critical points and evaluate the function at those points.3. Use the dot product interpretation to see that the maximum is the magnitude of the vector ( (a, b) ).All these methods lead to the same conclusion, so I feel confident that the maximum value is indeed ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).**Final Answer**The maximum value is boxed{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}."},{"question":"Solve the system of linear equations:begin{aligned}& 2 x_{1}+5 x_{2}-4 x_{3}=8 & 3 x_{1}+15 x_{2}-9 x_{3}=5 & 5 x_{1}+5 x_{2}-7 x_{3}=1end{aligned}","answer":"Okay, so I have this system of linear equations to solve. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:1. (2x_1 + 5x_2 - 4x_3 = 8)2. (3x_1 + 15x_2 - 9x_3 = 5)3. (5x_1 + 5x_2 - 7x_3 = 1)Hmm, I need to find the values of (x_1), (x_2), and (x_3) that satisfy all three equations. I remember that there are a few methods to solve systems like this: substitution, elimination, or using matrices. Since this is a 3x3 system, elimination might work, but it can get a bit messy. Maybe I'll try the elimination method step by step.First, let me see if I can eliminate one variable from two of the equations. Looking at equations 1 and 2, I notice that the coefficients of (x_2) are 5 and 15, which are multiples of each other. That might be helpful. Similarly, in equations 1 and 3, the coefficients of (x_2) are 5 and 5, so that could also be useful.Let me try to eliminate (x_2) first. Starting with equations 1 and 2:Equation 1: (2x_1 + 5x_2 - 4x_3 = 8)Equation 2: (3x_1 + 15x_2 - 9x_3 = 5)If I multiply equation 1 by 3, the coefficient of (x_2) will become 15, which is the same as in equation 2. Then I can subtract them to eliminate (x_2).Multiplying equation 1 by 3:(3*(2x_1 + 5x_2 - 4x_3) = 3*8)Which gives:(6x_1 + 15x_2 - 12x_3 = 24)Now, subtract equation 2 from this new equation:((6x_1 + 15x_2 - 12x_3) - (3x_1 + 15x_2 - 9x_3) = 24 - 5)Calculating the left side:(6x_1 - 3x_1 = 3x_1)(15x_2 - 15x_2 = 0)(-12x_3 - (-9x_3) = -3x_3)Right side: 24 - 5 = 19So the resulting equation is:(3x_1 - 3x_3 = 19)Let me write that as equation 4:4. (3x_1 - 3x_3 = 19)Simplify equation 4 by dividing both sides by 3:(x_1 - x_3 = frac{19}{3})So, (x_1 = x_3 + frac{19}{3})Okay, that's one relationship between (x_1) and (x_3). Now, let's try to eliminate (x_2) from another pair of equations. Let's take equations 1 and 3:Equation 1: (2x_1 + 5x_2 - 4x_3 = 8)Equation 3: (5x_1 + 5x_2 - 7x_3 = 1)Here, the coefficients of (x_2) are both 5, so if I subtract equation 1 from equation 3, I can eliminate (x_2).Subtracting equation 1 from equation 3:((5x_1 - 2x_1) + (5x_2 - 5x_2) + (-7x_3 - (-4x_3)) = 1 - 8)Calculating each term:(5x_1 - 2x_1 = 3x_1)(5x_2 - 5x_2 = 0)(-7x_3 + 4x_3 = -3x_3)Right side: 1 - 8 = -7So, the resulting equation is:(3x_1 - 3x_3 = -7)Let me write that as equation 5:5. (3x_1 - 3x_3 = -7)Wait a second, equation 4 was (3x_1 - 3x_3 = 19) and now equation 5 is (3x_1 - 3x_3 = -7). That can't be right because (19) is not equal to (-7). Hmm, that suggests that there might be a mistake in my calculations or that the system is inconsistent.Let me double-check my steps.Starting with equations 1 and 2:Equation 1: (2x_1 + 5x_2 - 4x_3 = 8)Equation 2: (3x_1 + 15x_2 - 9x_3 = 5)I multiplied equation 1 by 3:(6x_1 + 15x_2 - 12x_3 = 24)Then subtracted equation 2:(6x_1 - 3x_1 = 3x_1)(15x_2 - 15x_2 = 0)(-12x_3 - (-9x_3) = -3x_3)24 - 5 = 19So equation 4 is correct: (3x_1 - 3x_3 = 19)Now, equations 1 and 3:Equation 1: (2x_1 + 5x_2 - 4x_3 = 8)Equation 3: (5x_1 + 5x_2 - 7x_3 = 1)Subtracting equation 1 from equation 3:(5x_1 - 2x_1 = 3x_1)(5x_2 - 5x_2 = 0)(-7x_3 - (-4x_3) = -3x_3)1 - 8 = -7So equation 5 is correct: (3x_1 - 3x_3 = -7)Wait, so equation 4 and equation 5 are:4. (3x_1 - 3x_3 = 19)5. (3x_1 - 3x_3 = -7)Which is impossible because (19 neq -7). That suggests that there is no solution because these two equations contradict each other. So, does that mean the system is inconsistent?But before I conclude that, let me check my calculations again because it's easy to make a mistake.Looking back at equation 2: (3x_1 + 15x_2 - 9x_3 = 5)Equation 1 multiplied by 3: (6x_1 + 15x_2 - 12x_3 = 24)Subtracting equation 2: (6x_1 - 3x_1 = 3x_1), (15x_2 - 15x_2 = 0), (-12x_3 - (-9x_3) = -3x_3), 24 - 5 = 19. That seems correct.Equation 3: (5x_1 + 5x_2 - 7x_3 = 1)Equation 1: (2x_1 + 5x_2 - 4x_3 = 8)Subtracting equation 1 from equation 3: (5x_1 - 2x_1 = 3x_1), (5x_2 - 5x_2 = 0), (-7x_3 - (-4x_3) = -3x_3), 1 - 8 = -7. That also seems correct.So, both equations 4 and 5 are correct, but they are contradictory. Therefore, the system has no solution. It is inconsistent.But wait, before I conclude that, maybe I should try another approach to see if I made a mistake in elimination.Alternatively, I can use the matrix method. Let's set up the augmented matrix:[begin{bmatrix}2 & 5 & -4 & | & 8 3 & 15 & -9 & | & 5 5 & 5 & -7 & | & 1 end{bmatrix}]Let me perform row operations to reduce this matrix.First, let's make the element under the first pivot (which is 2) zero. The first pivot is in row 1, column 1.Row 2: Row2 - (3/2)Row1Row 3: Row3 - (5/2)Row1Calculating Row2:Row2: 3 - (3/2)*2 = 3 - 3 = 015 - (3/2)*5 = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5-9 - (3/2)*(-4) = -9 + 6 = -35 - (3/2)*8 = 5 - 12 = -7So Row2 becomes: [0, 7.5, -3 | -7]Similarly, Row3:Row3: 5 - (5/2)*2 = 5 - 5 = 05 - (5/2)*5 = 5 - 12.5 = -7.5-7 - (5/2)*(-4) = -7 + 10 = 31 - (5/2)*8 = 1 - 20 = -19So Row3 becomes: [0, -7.5, 3 | -19]Now, the matrix looks like:[begin{bmatrix}2 & 5 & -4 & | & 8 0 & 7.5 & -3 & | & -7 0 & -7.5 & 3 & | & -19 end{bmatrix}]Now, let's look at rows 2 and 3. If I add Row2 and Row3 together, I can eliminate the second variable.Row3: Row3 + Row20 + 0 = 0-7.5 + 7.5 = 03 + (-3) = 0-19 + (-7) = -26So Row3 becomes: [0, 0, 0 | -26]Which translates to the equation: 0x1 + 0x2 + 0x3 = -26, which simplifies to 0 = -26. That's impossible.This confirms that the system is inconsistent, meaning there is no solution.Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I should check if I did the row operations correctly.Starting with the original matrix:Row1: [2, 5, -4 | 8]Row2: [3, 15, -9 | 5]Row3: [5, 5, -7 | 1]First, Row2 = Row2 - (3/2)Row1:3 - (3/2)*2 = 015 - (3/2)*5 = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5-9 - (3/2)*(-4) = -9 + 6 = -35 - (3/2)*8 = 5 - 12 = -7So Row2 is correct.Row3 = Row3 - (5/2)Row1:5 - (5/2)*2 = 05 - (5/2)*5 = 5 - 12.5 = -7.5-7 - (5/2)*(-4) = -7 + 10 = 31 - (5/2)*8 = 1 - 20 = -19So Row3 is correct.Then adding Row2 and Row3:0 + 0 = 07.5 + (-7.5) = 0-3 + 3 = 0-7 + (-19) = -26So yes, the result is 0 = -26, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.Alternatively, maybe I can check the determinant of the coefficient matrix to see if it's singular or not.The coefficient matrix is:[begin{bmatrix}2 & 5 & -4 3 & 15 & -9 5 & 5 & -7 end{bmatrix}]Calculating the determinant:Using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Let's do cofactor expansion along the first row.Determinant = 2*(15*(-7) - (-9)*5) - 5*(3*(-7) - (-9)*5) + (-4)*(3*5 - 15*5)Calculating each term:First term: 2*( -105 - (-45) ) = 2*(-105 + 45) = 2*(-60) = -120Second term: -5*( -21 - (-45) ) = -5*(-21 + 45) = -5*(24) = -120Third term: -4*(15 - 75) = -4*(-60) = 240Adding them up: -120 - 120 + 240 = 0So the determinant is 0, which means the system is either inconsistent or dependent. Since we found a contradiction, it's inconsistent, so no solution.Therefore, the system has no solution.**Final Answer**The system of equations has no solution. boxed{text{No solution}}"},{"question":"A population is divided into three layers A, B, and C, with their individual counts in a ratio of 3:6:1. Using stratified sampling, a sample of capacity 20 is drawn from the population. Given that the probability of both elements a and b from layer C being sampled is frac{1}{21}, determine the total number of individuals in the population.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about stratified sampling. Let me try to understand it step by step. First, the population is divided into three layers: A, B, and C. Their counts are in the ratio 3:6:1. That means for every 3 people in A, there are 6 in B and 1 in C. So, if I let the number of people in A be 3k, then B would be 6k and C would be k, right? So the total population would be 3k + 6k + k = 10k. Hmm, so the total number of individuals is 10k, but I don't know what k is yet.Now, they're using stratified sampling to draw a sample of size 20. Stratified sampling means that we take samples from each layer proportionally, right? So the number of samples taken from each layer should be proportional to their size in the population.Given that, let me figure out how many samples we take from each layer. The ratio is 3:6:1, so total ratio parts are 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. So, each part is equal to 20 / 10 = 2. Therefore, the number of samples from A would be 3 * 2 = 6, from B would be 6 * 2 = 12, and from C would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, we take 6 from A, 12 from B, and 2 from C.Wait, but the problem mentions elements a and b from layer C. So, they're specifically talking about layer C. It says the probability of both a and b being sampled is 1/21. So, I need to relate this probability to the sampling process.Since we're doing stratified sampling, the sampling within each layer is typically done without replacement, right? So, for layer C, which has k individuals, we are taking a sample of size 2. So, the number of possible ways to choose 2 individuals from layer C is C(k, 2) = k(k - 1)/2. The number of favorable outcomes is 1, since we're specifically looking at elements a and b. So, the probability of selecting both a and b is 1 / C(k, 2).But wait, the problem says this probability is 1/21. So, 1 / [k(k - 1)/2] = 1/21. Let me write that equation:1 / [k(k - 1)/2] = 1/21Simplify the left side:2 / [k(k - 1)] = 1/21Cross-multiplying:2 * 21 = k(k - 1)So, 42 = k^2 - kBring all terms to one side:k^2 - k - 42 = 0Now, solve this quadratic equation. Let's factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -42 and add to -1. Hmm, 6 and -7: 6 * (-7) = -42, and 6 + (-7) = -1. So, the factors are (k - 7)(k + 6) = 0. So, k = 7 or k = -6. Since k can't be negative, k = 7.So, layer C has k = 7 individuals. Then, layer A has 3k = 21, and layer B has 6k = 42. Therefore, the total population is 21 + 42 + 7 = 70.Wait, let me double-check my steps. First, the ratio is 3:6:1, so total ratio is 10. The sample size is 20, so each ratio unit corresponds to 2 samples. So, from C, we take 2 samples. The number of ways to choose 2 from C is C(k, 2). The probability of choosing a specific pair is 1 / C(k, 2). They say this is 1/21, so 1 / [k(k - 1)/2] = 1/21, which leads to k(k - 1) = 42. Solving that gives k = 7. Then, total population is 10k = 70. That seems consistent.But just to make sure, let me think about the probability again. If layer C has 7 people, then the number of ways to choose 2 is 7*6/2 = 21. So, the probability of selecting any specific pair is 1/21, which matches the given probability. So, that's correct.Therefore, the total number of individuals in the population is 70.**Final Answer**The total number of individuals in the population is boxed{70}."},{"question":"In a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the three side lengths is 1800.

On each subsequent move, Petya can either place a new rook on some cell or move the rook from a cell numbered ( a ) horizontally or vertically to a cell with a number greater than ( a ). Each time a rook lands on a cell, that cell is immediately colored; placing a rook on a colored cell is prohibited. What is the minimum number of rooks Petya will need to color all cells of the grid regardless of the initial numbering?","answer":"Alright, so I came across this interesting problem about an ( n times n ) grid where each cell is numbered from 1 to ( n^2 ). Petya is trying to color all the cells by moving rooks according to certain rules. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of rooks he needs, regardless of how the grid is initially numbered.Let me try to break this down. First, the rules: Petya starts by placing a rook on any cell. Then, on each subsequent move, he can either place a new rook or move an existing rook from a cell numbered ( a ) to another cell with a number greater than ( a ), either horizontally or vertically. Every time a rook lands on a cell, that cell gets colored, and you can't place a rook on a colored cell again.So, the challenge is to determine the minimum number of rooks required to color the entire grid, no matter how the numbers are arranged. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how rooks move. They can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, right? So, if a rook is on a cell, it can potentially reach any cell in its row or column in one move, provided the numbers are increasing.Wait, but the movement is restricted to cells with higher numbers. So, if a rook is on cell ( a ), it can only move to a cell with a number greater than ( a ). That means the rook can only move to cells with higher numbers, which are somewhere in the grid, but not necessarily adjacent.So, if the numbers are arranged in a way that's not too scattered, maybe a single rook could traverse the entire grid? But the problem says \\"regardless of the initial numbering,\\" so we have to consider the worst-case scenario. That is, the numbering could be such that it's really inconvenient for Petya, forcing him to use more rooks.Let me think about smaller grids first. Maybe that can give me some intuition.Let's start with a 1x1 grid. That's trivial; only one cell, so Petya just needs one rook. Easy.What about a 2x2 grid? The cells are numbered from 1 to 4. Let's consider different numberings.Case 1: The numbers are in order, like:1 23 4In this case, Petya can place a rook on 1. Then move it right to 2, then down to 3, then right to 4. So, he only needs one rook.Case 2: The numbers are arranged in a different order. For example:2 14 3Here, starting at 2, he can move right to 1? Wait, no, because 1 is less than 2. So, he can't move there. Alternatively, starting at 2, he can move down to 4, then left to 3, but 3 is less than 4, so he can't move there. Hmm, so maybe he needs to place another rook.Wait, let me think again. If he starts at 2, he can move down to 4, which is higher. Then, from 4, he can't move anywhere else because 3 is less than 4. So, he needs to place another rook on 1 or 3. If he places a rook on 1, he can move it down to 3. So, in total, he uses two rooks.Alternatively, if he starts at 1, he can move right to 2, then down to 4, but then he can't reach 3 because it's less than 4. So, he needs another rook for 3. So, again, two rooks.Is it possible to do it with one rook? It doesn't seem so because 1 and 3 are both lower than 2 and 4, so the rook can't reach them once it's on 2 or 4. So, in the worst case, Petya needs two rooks for a 2x2 grid.Wait, but hold on. If the numbers are arranged as:1 32 4Then, starting at 1, move right to 3, then down to 4, then left to 2. So, he can color all cells with one rook.But in the previous case, he needed two. So, depending on the numbering, it can vary. But the question is about the minimum number of rooks needed regardless of the initial numbering. So, in the worst case, he needs two rooks for 2x2.So, for 2x2, the answer is 2.Moving on to 3x3 grid. Let's see.If the numbers are arranged in a way that's increasing row-wise, then one rook can traverse the entire grid by moving right and down as needed. But again, the problem is about the worst-case numbering.What's the worst possible numbering? It's probably a numbering where the numbers are arranged such that you can't traverse the entire grid with a single rook, forcing you to use multiple rooks.I think the key here is to model this as a graph where each cell is a node, and there's a directed edge from cell ( a ) to cell ( b ) if ( b ) is in the same row or column as ( a ) and ( b > a ). Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of paths needed to cover all nodes, where each path is a sequence of increasing numbers in the same row or column.This is known as the path cover problem in graph theory. The minimum number of paths needed to cover all nodes is equal to the size of the maximum antichain, according to Dilworth's theorem. An antichain is a set of elements where no two are comparable, meaning no two can be connected by a directed path.In this context, an antichain would be a set of cells where none can be reached from another via a rook move (i.e., they are not in the same row or column with increasing numbers). So, the size of the maximum antichain would give the minimum number of rooks needed.Wait, but Dilworth's theorem applies to partially ordered sets (posets). In our case, the poset is defined by the grid where two cells are comparable if one can reach the other via a sequence of rook moves (i.e., same row or column with increasing numbers). So, the grid forms a poset under this relation.Therefore, the minimum number of rooks needed is equal to the size of the maximum antichain in this poset.Now, what's the maximum antichain in an ( n times n ) grid? In a grid poset, the maximum antichain is given by Sperner's theorem, which states that the size is the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{lfloor n/2 rfloor} ). But wait, Sperner's theorem applies to the Boolean lattice, not exactly to grids.Wait, perhaps I'm conflating different concepts. Let me think again.In the grid poset, each cell can be identified by its row and column. The partial order is defined by ( (i,j) leq (k,l) ) if ( i leq k ) and ( j leq l ). So, it's a two-dimensional grid poset.In such a poset, the maximum antichain is indeed given by the set of elements with the middle rank. For an ( n times n ) grid, the ranks go from 2 to ( 2n ), where the rank of a cell ( (i,j) ) is ( i + j ). The maximum antichain is the set of cells with rank ( n + 1 ), which is the middle rank.The number of such cells is ( n ), since for each ( i ) from 1 to ( n ), ( j = n + 1 - i ). So, the maximum antichain has size ( n ).Wait, that seems too large. For example, in a 2x2 grid, the maximum antichain would be size 2, which matches our earlier result. For a 3x3 grid, the maximum antichain would be size 3.But in the 3x3 grid, can we really need 3 rooks? Let me test that.Suppose the grid is numbered such that each row is a permutation of 1 to 3, but arranged in a way that each row and column has numbers that don't allow a single rook to traverse all.Wait, actually, if the numbers are arranged such that each row and column is decreasing, then a rook can only move to cells with higher numbers, which would be in the opposite direction. But in such a case, you might need multiple rooks.Alternatively, if the numbers are arranged in a way that each row and column has a \\"peak\\" in the middle, then you might need multiple rooks.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the maximum antichain in the grid poset.In the grid poset, the maximum antichain is indeed the set of cells where ( i + j = n + 1 ). So, for each ( i ), ( j = n + 1 - i ). So, the number of such cells is ( n ). Therefore, according to Dilworth's theorem, the minimum number of chains (which correspond to rook paths) needed to cover the grid is equal to the size of the maximum antichain, which is ( n ).But wait, in our 2x2 grid, the maximum antichain is size 2, which matches the result. For 3x3, it would be 3. So, does that mean that in the worst case, Petya needs ( n ) rooks?But let me test this with a 3x3 grid. Suppose the cells are numbered such that each cell on the main diagonal is 1, 5, 9, and the rest are arranged in a way that moving from a cell only allows moving to cells in the same row or column with higher numbers, but not crossing the diagonal.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of permutation matrices or something else.Alternatively, let's think about the grid as a bipartite graph, with rows and columns as two sets, and cells as edges. Then, the problem is similar to covering all edges with paths, where each path alternates between rows and columns, moving to higher numbers.But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable.Wait, another approach: since each rook can cover an entire row or column, but only in one direction (increasing numbers), the problem resembles covering the grid with increasing paths.But since the numbering is arbitrary, we need to ensure that regardless of how the numbers are assigned, we can cover the grid with a certain number of rooks.Wait, perhaps the key is that in the worst case, the numbers are arranged such that each row and each column has its numbers arranged in decreasing order. Then, a rook can only move in one direction in each row and column, but since they are decreasing, it can't move anywhere.Wait, no, if a rook is placed on a cell, it can only move to cells with higher numbers. So, if a row is arranged in decreasing order, a rook can only move leftwards in that row, but since the numbers are decreasing, moving left would mean going to a higher number. Wait, actually, if the row is 3, 2, 1, then moving right from 3 would go to 2, which is less, so the rook can't move right. But moving left from 3, it would go to 2, which is less, so it can't move left either. So, in such a case, a rook placed on 3 can't move anywhere else in the row. Similarly, if placed on 2, it can't move left or right because 3 is higher but to the left, but moving left from 2 would go to 3, which is higher, so that's allowed.Wait, hold on. If the row is 3, 2, 1, then starting at 2, can I move left to 3? Since 3 > 2, yes, that's allowed. So, from 2, moving left to 3, then from 3, can I move further left? There's nothing to the left of 3 in the row, so no. Similarly, from 2, can I move right to 1? No, because 1 < 2.So, in this case, starting at 2, you can move left to 3, coloring both 2 and 3. Then, you need another rook to color 1.Alternatively, if you start at 3, you can't move anywhere else in the row, so you need another rook for 2 and 1.Wait, so in this case, you need two rooks for a single row if it's arranged in decreasing order.But in our problem, the grid is 2D, so maybe the interactions between rows and columns can help.Wait, let's think about the entire grid. If each row is arranged in decreasing order, then in each row, you can traverse from the middle to the higher numbers on one side, but not the other. But since columns can also be used, maybe you can move between rows via columns.Wait, for example, in a 3x3 grid, if each row is 3, 2, 1, and each column is also 3, 2, 1. Then, starting at the center cell (2,2) which is 2, you can move up to (1,2)=3, then right to (1,3)=1? No, because 1 < 3. Alternatively, from (2,2)=2, you can move left to (2,1)=3, then up to (1,1)=3? Wait, but (1,1) is 3, which is equal to (2,1)=3, so you can't move there because you need a higher number.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the maximum number of cells that cannot be reached from each other via rook moves, which would form the maximum antichain.In the grid poset, the maximum antichain is indeed the set of cells where ( i + j = n + 1 ), which has size ( n ). So, according to Dilworth's theorem, the minimum number of chains needed to cover the poset is equal to the size of the maximum antichain, which is ( n ).Therefore, in the worst-case numbering, Petya would need ( n ) rooks to color the entire grid.Wait, but in the 2x2 case, the maximum antichain is size 2, which matches our earlier result. For 3x3, it would be 3. So, this seems consistent.But let me test this with a specific example for 3x3.Suppose the grid is numbered such that each cell ( (i,j) ) has number ( 3(i-1) + j ). So, it's row-wise increasing. Then, a single rook can traverse the entire grid by moving right and down. So, in this case, only one rook is needed.But the problem is about the worst-case numbering. So, we need to find a numbering where the minimum number of rooks required is as large as possible, and then determine what that number is.If the maximum antichain is ( n ), then that would mean that in the worst case, you need ( n ) rooks.Wait, but how does the antichain relate to the rook moves? Each rook can cover a chain, which is a sequence of increasing numbers in the same row or column. So, if the maximum antichain is ( n ), then you need at least ( n ) rooks to cover all the cells.But is this tight? That is, can we always cover the grid with ( n ) rooks regardless of the numbering?Wait, actually, in the grid poset, Dilworth's theorem says that the minimum number of chains needed to cover the poset equals the size of the largest antichain. So, if the largest antichain is ( n ), then ( n ) rooks suffice.But does this apply here? Because in our case, the poset is defined by the grid with the partial order of being in the same row or column with increasing numbers. So, each chain corresponds to a sequence of cells that can be traversed by a single rook, moving only to higher-numbered cells in the same row or column.Therefore, the minimum number of rooks needed is equal to the size of the largest antichain, which is ( n ).Hence, regardless of the numbering, Petya can always color the entire grid with ( n ) rooks, and there exists a numbering where he needs at least ( n ) rooks. Therefore, the minimal number is ( n ).Wait, but let me think about another example. Suppose the grid is numbered such that each diagonal has the same number. For instance, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal is 1, 2, 3, and the other diagonals are filled accordingly. But I'm not sure if that would force more rooks.Alternatively, think of the grid as a permutation matrix where each row and column has exactly one rook. But that might not directly apply.Wait, another way to think about it: since each rook can cover an entire row or column in one direction, but only if the numbers are arranged appropriately. In the worst case, the numbers are arranged such that each row and column has its numbers scattered in a way that you can't cover multiple rows or columns with a single rook.But according to Dilworth's theorem, since the maximum antichain is ( n ), you need at least ( n ) rooks, and you can cover the grid with ( n ) rooks.Therefore, the minimal number of rooks required is ( n ).So, putting it all together, for an ( n times n ) grid, the minimum number of rooks needed is ( n ).**Final Answer**The minimum number of rooks Petya will need is boxed{n}."},{"question":"During April, the baker sold 453 cakes at 12 and 126 pies at 7.

The requirements are that vehicles A and B must participate and vehicle A must go before vehicle B. How many different dispatch plans are there? (Answer with a number)","answer":"First, I need to determine how many ways to choose 4 vehicles out of the 7 available. This can be calculated using the combination formula C(7,4), which equals 35.Next, since vehicles A and B must be included in the dispatch, I subtract them from the total, leaving 5 other vehicles. I then choose 2 more vehicles from these 5, which can be done in C(5,2) = 10 ways.Now, I have a total of 4 vehicles, including A and B. To ensure that A comes before B in the order, I calculate the number of possible arrangements. There are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the 4 vehicles, and since A must come before B, only half of these arrangements satisfy the condition, resulting in 12 valid orders.Finally, I multiply the number of ways to choose the vehicles by the number of valid orders: 10 * 12 = 120.

Since their sum is 1998, I can express ( y ) as ( 1998 - x ).Next, I define the product ( P ) as ( P = x times y = x times (1998 - x) ). Simplifying this, the product becomes ( P = 1998x - x^2 ).To find the maximum value of ( P ), I take the derivative of ( P ) with respect to ( x ), which gives ( frac{dP}{dx} = 1998 - 2x ). Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points, I solve ( 1998 - 2x = 0 ), resulting in ( x = 999 ).Substituting ( x = 999 ) back into the equation for ( y ), I find ( y = 1998 - 999 = 999 ). Therefore, both integers are 999.Finally, calculating the product ( P ) gives ( 999 times 999 = 998001 ).

Find the distribution table and the expected value Exi of xi.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a frequency distribution table for a comprehensive ability test. There are three parts to it, and I need to solve each step by step. Let me try to understand each part carefully.Starting with part 1: It says there's a frequency distribution table with score ranges and their corresponding frequencies. The frequencies are given as decimals, except for the last one, which is marked with an asterisk (*). It also mentions that there are 21 students in the score range [80,90). Hmm, wait, looking at the table, the score ranges are [80,85) and [85,90), each with a frequency of 0.2 and 0.15 respectively. So, does that mean the total number of students in [80,90) is the sum of these two frequencies? Let me check.Yes, the score range [80,90) is split into [80,85) and [85,90), so their frequencies should add up. The frequency for [80,85) is 0.2 and for [85,90) is 0.15. So, adding those together, 0.2 + 0.15 = 0.35. But it's given that there are 21 students in [80,90). So, if 0.35 corresponds to 21 students, then the total number of students in the entire class can be found by dividing 21 by 0.35.Let me compute that: 21 / 0.35. Hmm, 0.35 goes into 21 how many times? Well, 0.35 times 60 is 21, right? Because 0.35 * 60 = 21. So, the total number of students is 60.Now, the last score range is [95,100], and its frequency is given as *. Since all the frequencies should add up to 1 (because it's a probability distribution), I can find the missing frequency by subtracting the sum of the given frequencies from 1.Let me add up the given frequencies:0.1 (for [65,70)) + 0.15 (for [70,75)) + 0.2 (for [75,80)) + 0.2 (for [80,85)) + 0.15 (for [85,90)) + 0.1 (for [90,95)) = 0.1 + 0.15 is 0.25, plus 0.2 is 0.45, plus another 0.2 is 0.65, plus 0.15 is 0.8, plus 0.1 is 0.9.So, the sum of all given frequencies except the last one is 0.9. Therefore, the missing frequency for [95,100] is 1 - 0.9 = 0.1.But wait, the total number of students is 60, so the number of students in [95,100] would be 0.1 * 60 = 6 students. So, the answer to part 1 is 6 students.Moving on to part 2: It says that we want to select 2 students from the score range [95,100] to participate in a physics interest group. The probability of having at least one male student among the selected 2 is 3/5. We need to find the number of male students in that score range.First, let's note that in part 1, we found that there are 6 students in [95,100]. Let me denote the number of male students as m. Then, the number of female students would be 6 - m.The probability of selecting at least one male student is given as 3/5. It's often easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event (i.e., selecting no male students) and subtract it from 1.So, the probability of selecting 2 female students is C(6 - m, 2) / C(6, 2). Therefore, the probability of at least one male is 1 - [C(6 - m, 2) / C(6, 2)] = 3/5.Let me write that equation:1 - [C(6 - m, 2) / C(6, 2)] = 3/5First, compute C(6, 2). That's 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15.So, the equation becomes:1 - [C(6 - m, 2) / 15] = 3/5Let me rearrange this equation:[C(6 - m, 2) / 15] = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5So, C(6 - m, 2) = (2/5) * 15 = 6Therefore, C(6 - m, 2) = 6Now, C(n, 2) = n(n - 1)/2, so:(6 - m)(5 - m)/2 = 6Multiply both sides by 2:(6 - m)(5 - m) = 12Let me expand the left side:(6 - m)(5 - m) = 30 - 6m - 5m + m^2 = m^2 - 11m + 30So, m^2 - 11m + 30 = 12Subtract 12 from both sides:m^2 - 11m + 18 = 0Now, solve the quadratic equation:m^2 - 11m + 18 = 0Using the quadratic formula, m = [11 ± sqrt(121 - 72)] / 2 = [11 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [11 ± 7] / 2So, m = (11 + 7)/2 = 18/2 = 9 or m = (11 - 7)/2 = 4/2 = 2But wait, m is the number of male students in the score range [95,100], which has only 6 students. So, m can't be 9 because that's more than the total number of students. Therefore, m must be 2.Wait, hold on. If m = 2, then the number of female students is 6 - 2 = 4. Let me verify if this gives the correct probability.Compute C(4, 2) = 6, and C(6, 2) = 15. So, the probability of selecting 2 females is 6/15 = 2/5. Therefore, the probability of at least one male is 1 - 2/5 = 3/5, which matches the given probability. So, yes, m = 2 is correct.Therefore, the number of male students in [95,100] is 2.Now, moving on to part 3: It says there are 4 female students in the score range [65,70). We need to select 3 students from this score range for an enrichment group, and let ξ be the number of male students selected. We have to find the distribution table and the expected value Eξ.First, let's figure out how many students are in the score range [65,70). From the frequency table, the frequency is 0.1. Since the total number of students is 60, the number of students in [65,70) is 0.1 * 60 = 6 students.It's given that there are 4 female students in this range, so the number of male students must be 6 - 4 = 2.So, in the score range [65,70), there are 2 male students and 4 female students.We need to select 3 students from these 6. Let ξ be the number of male students selected. So, ξ can take values 0, 1, or 2, since there are only 2 male students.We need to find the probability distribution of ξ, which means finding P(ξ=0), P(ξ=1), and P(ξ=2).This is a hypergeometric distribution problem because we are sampling without replacement from a finite population.The formula for the hypergeometric probability is:P(ξ = k) = C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k) / C(N, n)Where:- N is the total population size (6 students)- K is the number of success states in the population (2 male students)- n is the number of draws (3 students)- k is the number of observed successes (0, 1, or 2 males)So, let's compute each probability.First, compute C(6, 3) which is the total number of ways to choose 3 students out of 6.C(6, 3) = 20.Now, compute P(ξ=0): probability of selecting 0 males (i.e., all 3 are females).Number of ways to choose 0 males from 2: C(2, 0) = 1Number of ways to choose 3 females from 4: C(4, 3) = 4So, P(ξ=0) = (1 * 4) / 20 = 4/20 = 1/5Next, P(ξ=1): probability of selecting 1 male and 2 females.Number of ways to choose 1 male from 2: C(2, 1) = 2Number of ways to choose 2 females from 4: C(4, 2) = 6So, P(ξ=1) = (2 * 6) / 20 = 12/20 = 3/5Then, P(ξ=2): probability of selecting 2 males and 1 female.Number of ways to choose 2 males from 2: C(2, 2) = 1Number of ways to choose 1 female from 4: C(4, 1) = 4So, P(ξ=2) = (1 * 4) / 20 = 4/20 = 1/5Let me verify that these probabilities add up to 1:1/5 + 3/5 + 1/5 = (1 + 3 + 1)/5 = 5/5 = 1. Good.So, the distribution table for ξ is:ξ | 0 | 1 | 2---|---|---|---P(ξ) | 1/5 | 3/5 | 1/5Now, to find the expected value Eξ, we can use the formula:Eξ = Σ [ξ * P(ξ)]So, compute:Eξ = 0 * (1/5) + 1 * (3/5) + 2 * (1/5) = 0 + 3/5 + 2/5 = (3 + 2)/5 = 5/5 = 1Alternatively, since this is a hypergeometric distribution, the expected value can also be calculated as:Eξ = n * (K / N) = 3 * (2 / 6) = 3 * (1/3) = 1Which confirms our earlier calculation.So, the expected value Eξ is 1.Let me recap the steps:1. Found the total number of students by using the given frequency for [80,90) and the number of students there. Then, found the missing frequency for [95,100] by subtracting the sum of other frequencies from 1, leading to 6 students in that range.2. For the probability part, set up the equation using the complementary probability, solved the quadratic equation, and found that there are 2 male students in [95,100].3. For the distribution, determined the number of male and female students in [65,70), then used hypergeometric distribution to find the probabilities for selecting 0, 1, or 2 males. Calculated the expected value both directly and using the hypergeometric expectation formula, both giving 1.I think that covers all parts. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.In part 1: 21 students correspond to 0.35 frequency, so total students = 21 / 0.35 = 60. Then, missing frequency is 0.1, so 0.1 * 60 = 6. Correct.In part 2: 6 students in total, m males. Probability of at least one male is 3/5. So, 1 - C(6 - m, 2)/15 = 3/5. Solved and got m=2. Checked and it works. Correct.In part 3: 6 students, 4 female, 2 male. Selecting 3. Calculated hypergeometric probabilities: 1/5, 3/5, 1/5. Expected value is 1. Correct.Yes, all steps seem solid.**Final Answer**1.

So, (left(frac{1}{3}right)^{-1} = 3).Finally, I add the two results together: (1 + 3 = 4)."},{"question":"If ( p ) is a positive integer, then (frac{3p + 25}{2p - 5}) can be a positive integer if and only if ( p ) is:(A) No less than 3.(B) No less than 3 and no greater than 35.(C) No greater than 35.(D) Equal to 35.(E) Equal to 3 or 35.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: If ( p ) is a positive integer, then the expression ( frac{3p + 25}{2p - 5} ) can be a positive integer if and only if ( p ) is one of the options given. The options are about whether ( p ) is no less than 3, no less than 3 and no greater than 35, no greater than 35, equal to 35, or equal to 3 or 35. First, I need to figure out for which positive integers ( p ) the fraction ( frac{3p + 25}{2p - 5} ) is also a positive integer. Since both the numerator and denominator are linear in ( p ), maybe I can manipulate the equation to find a relationship between ( p ) and the integer result.Let me denote ( k ) as the positive integer such that ( frac{3p + 25}{2p - 5} = k ). So, I can write the equation as:( 3p + 25 = k(2p - 5) )Expanding the right-hand side:( 3p + 25 = 2kp - 5k )Now, let's bring all terms to one side to solve for ( p ):( 3p + 25 - 2kp + 5k = 0 )Combine like terms:( (3 - 2k)p + (25 + 5k) = 0 )Now, solving for ( p ):( (3 - 2k)p = - (25 + 5k) )So,( p = frac{ - (25 + 5k) }{ 3 - 2k } )Simplify numerator and denominator:Factor out a 5 in the numerator:( p = frac{ -5(5 + k) }{ 3 - 2k } )Alternatively, I can factor out a negative sign from the denominator:( p = frac{ -5(5 + k) }{ - (2k - 3) } = frac{5(5 + k)}{2k - 3} )So, ( p = frac{5(k + 5)}{2k - 3} )Since ( p ) must be a positive integer, the denominator ( 2k - 3 ) must divide the numerator ( 5(k + 5) ). Also, ( 2k - 3 ) must be a positive integer because ( p ) is positive. So, ( 2k - 3 > 0 ) which implies ( k > frac{3}{2} ). Since ( k ) is a positive integer, ( k geq 2 ).So, ( k ) can be 2, 3, 4, etc. Now, we need to find all integers ( k geq 2 ) such that ( 2k - 3 ) divides ( 5(k + 5) ).Let me write that as:( 2k - 3 ) divides ( 5(k + 5) )Which means that ( 2k - 3 ) divides any linear combination of ( 2k - 3 ) and ( 5(k + 5) ). Maybe I can express ( 5(k + 5) ) in terms of ( 2k - 3 ) to find the remainder.Let me perform the division:Let me write ( 5(k + 5) = 5k + 25 ).Express this as a multiple of ( 2k - 3 ) plus a remainder.Let me see: Let's divide ( 5k + 25 ) by ( 2k - 3 ).First, how many times does ( 2k - 3 ) go into ( 5k + 25 )?The leading term is ( 5k ) divided by ( 2k ), which is ( frac{5}{2} ). Since we're dealing with integer division, maybe I can adjust.Alternatively, let's write:( 5k + 25 = q(2k - 3) + r ), where ( q ) is the quotient and ( r ) is the remainder, which should be less than ( 2k - 3 ).But since ( 2k - 3 ) is linear, the remainder should be a constant.Let me solve for ( q ) and ( r ):( 5k + 25 = q(2k - 3) + r )Let me choose ( q = 2 ). Then,( 2*(2k - 3) = 4k - 6 )Subtract this from ( 5k + 25 ):( 5k + 25 - (4k - 6) = k + 31 )Hmm, that's still linear. Maybe ( q = 3 ):( 3*(2k - 3) = 6k - 9 )Subtract from ( 5k + 25 ):( 5k + 25 - (6k - 9) = -k + 34 )Still linear. Maybe ( q = 1 ):( 1*(2k - 3) = 2k - 3 )Subtract from ( 5k + 25 ):( 5k + 25 - (2k - 3) = 3k + 28 )Still linear. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I should express ( 5(k + 5) ) as ( A*(2k - 3) + B ), where A and B are constants.Let me set up the equation:( 5(k + 5) = A*(2k - 3) + B )Expanding both sides:( 5k + 25 = 2A k - 3A + B )Now, equate coefficients:For ( k ): ( 5 = 2A ) => ( A = 5/2 )For constants: ( 25 = -3A + B )Substituting ( A = 5/2 ):( 25 = -3*(5/2) + B )( 25 = -15/2 + B )Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate fractions:( 50 = -15 + 2B )( 50 + 15 = 2B )( 65 = 2B )( B = 65/2 )So, ( 5(k + 5) = (5/2)(2k - 3) + 65/2 )Therefore, ( 5(k + 5) = (5/2)(2k - 3) + 65/2 )Which implies that:( 5(k + 5) = frac{5}{2}(2k - 3) + frac{65}{2} )So, the remainder is ( frac{65}{2} ). But since we're dealing with integer division, the remainder must be an integer. Therefore, ( 2k - 3 ) must divide 65.Wait, let me think again. Since ( 5(k + 5) = frac{5}{2}(2k - 3) + frac{65}{2} ), then:( 5(k + 5) - frac{5}{2}(2k - 3) = frac{65}{2} )Which simplifies to:( frac{65}{2} ) must be divisible by ( 2k - 3 ). But since ( 2k - 3 ) is an integer, ( frac{65}{2} ) divided by ( 2k - 3 ) must also be an integer. Therefore, ( 2k - 3 ) must be a divisor of ( frac{65}{2} ).But ( 2k - 3 ) is an integer, so ( frac{65}{2} ) divided by an integer must be an integer. That suggests that ( 2k - 3 ) must be a divisor of 65, but also that 65 must be divisible by ( 2(2k - 3) ). Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.Alternatively, since ( 2k - 3 ) divides ( 5(k + 5) ), and from the equation above, the remainder is ( frac{65}{2} ). Therefore, for ( 2k - 3 ) to divide ( 5(k + 5) ), the remainder must be zero. But ( frac{65}{2} ) is not an integer, so perhaps my approach is wrong.Wait, maybe I should consider that ( 2k - 3 ) divides ( 5(k + 5) ), so ( 2k - 3 ) must divide any linear combination, such as ( 5(k + 5) - m*(2k - 3) ) for some integer ( m ). Let me choose ( m = 2 ):( 5(k + 5) - 2*(2k - 3) = 5k + 25 - 4k + 6 = k + 31 )So, ( 2k - 3 ) divides ( k + 31 ). Now, let me write:( 2k - 3 ) divides ( k + 31 )Similarly, ( 2k - 3 ) divides ( 2*(k + 31) - (2k - 3) ) which is ( 2k + 62 - 2k + 3 = 65 )Therefore, ( 2k - 3 ) divides 65.So, ( 2k - 3 ) is a positive divisor of 65.Since ( 2k - 3 ) is positive, as we established earlier, and ( k geq 2 ), so ( 2k - 3 geq 1 ).The positive divisors of 65 are: 1, 5, 13, 65.Therefore, ( 2k - 3 ) can be 1, 5, 13, or 65.Let's solve for ( k ) in each case:1. ( 2k - 3 = 1 )   ( 2k = 4 )   ( k = 2 )2. ( 2k - 3 = 5 )   ( 2k = 8 )   ( k = 4 )3. ( 2k - 3 = 13 )   ( 2k = 16 )   ( k = 8 )4. ( 2k - 3 = 65 )   ( 2k = 68 )   ( k = 34 )So, the possible values of ( k ) are 2, 4, 8, 34.Now, let's find the corresponding ( p ) for each ( k ):Recall that ( p = frac{5(k + 5)}{2k - 3} )1. For ( k = 2 ):   ( p = frac{5(2 + 5)}{2*2 - 3} = frac{5*7}{4 - 3} = frac{35}{1} = 35 )2. For ( k = 4 ):   ( p = frac{5(4 + 5)}{2*4 - 3} = frac{5*9}{8 - 3} = frac{45}{5} = 9 )3. For ( k = 8 ):   ( p = frac{5(8 + 5)}{2*8 - 3} = frac{5*13}{16 - 3} = frac{65}{13} = 5 )4. For ( k = 34 ):   ( p = frac{5(34 + 5)}{2*34 - 3} = frac{5*39}{68 - 3} = frac{195}{65} = 3 )So, the possible values of ( p ) are 35, 9, 5, and 3.Wait, but the options given are:(A) No less than 3.(B) No less than 3 and no greater than 35.(C) No greater than 35.(D) Equal to 35.(E) Equal to 3 or 35.Hmm, so according to my calculations, ( p ) can be 3, 5, 9, or 35. So, the values are 3, 5, 9, 35. So, ( p ) can be any of these, which are all between 3 and 35, inclusive. So, the correct condition is that ( p ) is no less than 3 and no greater than 35. So, option (B).But wait, let me double-check my calculations because the options don't include all four values, only 3 and 35. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me check each ( p ):For ( p = 3 ):( frac{3*3 + 25}{2*3 - 5} = frac{9 + 25}{6 - 5} = frac{34}{1} = 34 ), which is an integer.For ( p = 5 ):( frac{3*5 + 25}{2*5 - 5} = frac{15 + 25}{10 - 5} = frac{40}{5} = 8 ), which is an integer.For ( p = 9 ):( frac{3*9 + 25}{2*9 - 5} = frac{27 + 25}{18 - 5} = frac{52}{13} = 4 ), which is an integer.For ( p = 35 ):( frac{3*35 + 25}{2*35 - 5} = frac{105 + 25}{70 - 5} = frac{130}{65} = 2 ), which is an integer.So, all four values are valid. However, the options don't include all four. The options are:(A) No less than 3.(B) No less than 3 and no greater than 35.(C) No greater than 35.(D) Equal to 35.(E) Equal to 3 or 35.So, the correct answer would be (B) because ( p ) must be between 3 and 35, inclusive, but the problem says \\"if and only if ( p ) is\\". So, the expression is a positive integer only when ( p ) is in that range, but actually, only specific values within that range work. However, the options don't specify that it's only those specific values, but rather the range. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that ( p ) must be in that range, but only certain values within it work. But the question is phrased as \\"if and only if ( p ) is\\", so it's looking for the condition on ( p ) such that the expression is a positive integer. Since all possible ( p ) that satisfy the condition are between 3 and 35, inclusive, the correct answer is (B).Wait, but let me think again. The question is asking for the condition on ( p ) such that the expression is a positive integer. So, ( p ) must be one of 3,5,9,35. So, the values are discrete, but the options are about ranges. So, perhaps the correct answer is (E) Equal to 3 or 35, but that's not correct because 5 and 9 also work. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the range within which ( p ) must lie, not the exact values. So, since ( p ) can be as low as 3 and as high as 35, the correct range is from 3 to 35, inclusive. So, option (B).But wait, let me check the problem statement again: \\"can be a positive integer if and only if ( p ) is\\". So, it's an \\"if and only if\\" condition, meaning that ( p ) must satisfy the condition given in the options for the expression to be a positive integer. Since the expression is a positive integer only when ( p ) is 3,5,9,35, which are all between 3 and 35, inclusive, the correct answer is (B) because ( p ) must be no less than 3 and no greater than 35. The other options are too broad or too narrow.Wait, but option (E) says equal to 3 or 35, which is incorrect because 5 and 9 also work. So, the answer is (B).But let me check again. The problem says \\"if and only if ( p ) is\\", so the condition must fully describe all possible ( p ) that make the expression a positive integer. Since ( p ) can be 3,5,9,35, the only way to describe all such ( p ) is that they are between 3 and 35, inclusive. So, (B) is correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects only the minimal and maximal values, but in this case, 3 and 35 are the minimal and maximal, but there are other values in between. So, the correct answer is (B).Wait, but let me think again. The options are:(A) No less than 3.(B) No less than 3 and no greater than 35.(C) No greater than 35.(D) Equal to 35.(E) Equal to 3 or 35.So, (B) is the only option that correctly captures all possible ( p ) values, even though not all integers in that range work, but the condition is about the range, not the exact values. So, the answer is (B).But wait, the problem says \\"if and only if ( p ) is\\", so it's a bi-conditional. So, the expression is a positive integer exactly when ( p ) is in the specified set. Since the expression is a positive integer only when ( p ) is 3,5,9,35, which are all within 3 to 35, inclusive, the correct answer is (B). So, I think (B) is correct.Wait, but let me check the problem statement again: \\"can be a positive integer if and only if ( p ) is\\". So, it's saying that the expression is a positive integer exactly when ( p ) is in the given condition. So, the condition must be such that all ( p ) in that condition make the expression a positive integer, and vice versa. But in reality, only specific ( p ) in that range make the expression a positive integer. So, perhaps the correct answer is (E), but that's not correct because 5 and 9 also work. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the minimal and maximal values, but since the options don't include all four, perhaps the answer is (E). But I'm confused now.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier steps. Let me go back.We had ( 2k - 3 ) divides 65, so ( 2k - 3 ) can be 1,5,13,65, leading to ( k = 2,4,8,34 ), and thus ( p = 35,9,5,3 ). So, the possible ( p ) are 3,5,9,35. So, the expression is a positive integer only when ( p ) is one of these four values. So, the correct answer should be that ( p ) is equal to 3,5,9, or 35. But none of the options include all four. The closest is (E) Equal to 3 or 35, but that's incomplete because 5 and 9 also work. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the minimal and maximal values, but that's not accurate.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me try another approach.Let me denote ( frac{3p + 25}{2p - 5} = k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer.So, cross-multiplying:( 3p + 25 = k(2p - 5) )Expanding:( 3p + 25 = 2kp - 5k )Bringing all terms to one side:( 3p - 2kp + 25 + 5k = 0 )Factor ( p ):( p(3 - 2k) + (25 + 5k) = 0 )Solving for ( p ):( p = frac{ - (25 + 5k) }{ 3 - 2k } )Simplify:( p = frac{5(k + 5)}{2k - 3} )Since ( p ) must be a positive integer, ( 2k - 3 ) must divide ( 5(k + 5) ). Also, ( 2k - 3 > 0 ) implies ( k geq 2 ).So, ( 2k - 3 ) divides ( 5(k + 5) ). Let me write ( d = 2k - 3 ), so ( d ) divides ( 5(k + 5) ). Also, ( d = 2k - 3 ) implies ( k = frac{d + 3}{2} ). Since ( k ) is an integer, ( d ) must be odd.So, ( d ) is an odd positive divisor of ( 5(k + 5) ). But since ( d = 2k - 3 ), and ( k = frac{d + 3}{2} ), substituting into ( 5(k + 5) ):( 5left( frac{d + 3}{2} + 5 right) = 5left( frac{d + 3 + 10}{2} right) = 5left( frac{d + 13}{2} right) )So, ( d ) divides ( frac{5(d + 13)}{2} ). Since ( d ) is odd, ( d ) must divide ( 5(d + 13) ). Let me write:( d ) divides ( 5(d + 13) )Which implies ( d ) divides ( 5*13 = 65 ), because ( d ) divides ( 5d + 65 ), and since ( d ) divides ( 5d ), it must divide 65.Therefore, ( d ) is a positive odd divisor of 65. The positive odd divisors of 65 are 1,5,13,65.So, ( d = 1,5,13,65 )Thus, ( 2k - 3 = d ), so:1. ( d = 1 ): ( 2k - 3 = 1 ) => ( k = 2 )2. ( d = 5 ): ( 2k - 3 = 5 ) => ( k = 4 )3. ( d = 13 ): ( 2k - 3 = 13 ) => ( k = 8 )4. ( d = 65 ): ( 2k - 3 = 65 ) => ( k = 34 )Then, ( p = frac{5(k + 5)}{d} ):1. For ( d = 1 ), ( k = 2 ): ( p = frac{5(2 + 5)}{1} = 35 )2. For ( d = 5 ), ( k = 4 ): ( p = frac{5(4 + 5)}{5} = 9 )3. For ( d = 13 ), ( k = 8 ): ( p = frac{5(8 + 5)}{13} = 5 )4. For ( d = 65 ), ( k = 34 ): ( p = frac{5(34 + 5)}{65} = 3 )So, the possible ( p ) values are 3,5,9,35. Therefore, the expression is a positive integer only when ( p ) is one of these four values. However, the options given don't include all four, but (E) says equal to 3 or 35, which is partially correct but incomplete. However, since the question is about the condition on ( p ), and all these values lie between 3 and 35, inclusive, the correct answer is (B) No less than 3 and no greater than 35.Wait, but the problem says \\"if and only if ( p ) is\\", so it's a bi-conditional. So, the expression is a positive integer exactly when ( p ) is in the specified set. Since the expression is a positive integer only when ( p ) is 3,5,9,35, which are all between 3 and 35, inclusive, the correct answer is (B). So, I think (B) is correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem expects only the minimal and maximal values, but since the options don't include all four, perhaps the answer is (E). But that's not correct because 5 and 9 also work. So, I think the correct answer is (B)."},{"question":"Let a and b be real numbers such that[a^3 - 15a^2 + 20a - 50 = 0 quad text{and} quad 8b^3 - 60b^2 - 290b + 2575 = 0.]Compute a + b.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of two real numbers, a and b, given their respective cubic equations. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:First equation: ( a^3 - 15a^2 + 20a - 50 = 0 )Second equation: ( 8b^3 - 60b^2 - 290b + 2575 = 0 )Hmm, both are cubic equations, which can be tricky. I remember that sometimes, especially in competition problems, the sum of roots or some substitution might help. Let me think about how to approach this.Starting with the first equation: ( a^3 - 15a^2 + 20a - 50 = 0 ). Maybe I can try to factor this or find rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem says that any rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -50 and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10, ±25, ±50.Let me test these. Plugging in a=1: 1 - 15 + 20 - 50 = -44 ≠ 0.a=2: 8 - 60 + 40 - 50 = -62 ≠ 0.a=5: 125 - 375 + 100 - 50 = -200 ≠ 0.a=10: 1000 - 1500 + 200 - 50 = -350 ≠ 0.a=25: That's way too big, probably won't work.a=-1: -1 - 15 - 20 - 50 = -86 ≠ 0.Hmm, none of these seem to work. Maybe this cubic doesn't have rational roots. That complicates things. Maybe I need to use some substitution or another method.Looking at the second equation: ( 8b^3 - 60b^2 - 290b + 2575 = 0 ). That's a bit more complicated because of the coefficients. Maybe I can factor out a common factor? Let's see, 8, 60, 290, 2575. 8 is 2^3, 60 is 2^2*3*5, 290 is 2*5*29, 2575 is 5^2*103. So, no common factor besides 1. So, factoring out won't help.Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let me think.Wait, both equations are cubic, and the problem is asking for a + b. Maybe there's a substitution that relates a and b such that a + b is a root of another equation, or perhaps a and b are related in a way that their sum is nice.Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the second equation to look similar to the first one. Let me try that.Looking at the second equation: ( 8b^3 - 60b^2 - 290b + 2575 = 0 ). Let me divide both sides by 8 to make the leading coefficient 1:( b^3 - (60/8)b^2 - (290/8)b + (2575/8) = 0 )Simplify the fractions:60/8 = 15/2, 290/8 = 145/4, 2575/8 is approximately 321.875.So, the equation becomes:( b^3 - (15/2)b^2 - (145/4)b + 2575/8 = 0 )Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can make a substitution like b = something in terms of a.Wait, let's think about the first equation again. Maybe if I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.Alternatively, perhaps if I let c = a + b, and then try to express both equations in terms of c. But that might be complicated.Wait, another idea: sometimes in these problems, the second equation is a transformation of the first. Maybe if I can write the second equation in terms of (something related to a), then maybe a + b is a nice number.Let me see. Let me try to manipulate the second equation.Let me write the second equation again:( 8b^3 - 60b^2 - 290b + 2575 = 0 )Let me factor out 8:( 8(b^3 - (60/8)b^2 - (290/8)b) + 2575 = 0 )Wait, that's similar to what I did before. Maybe instead, let me try to factor 8b^3 - 60b^2 - 290b + 2575.Alternatively, maybe I can factor by grouping. Let me try:Group terms as (8b^3 - 60b^2) + (-290b + 2575)Factor out 4b^2 from the first group: 4b^2(2b - 15)From the second group: -290b + 2575. Let's factor out -5: -5(58b - 515). Hmm, not sure if that helps.Wait, 58b - 515: 515 divided by 5 is 103, so 58b - 5*103. Not sure.Alternatively, maybe factor 8b^3 - 60b^2 as 4b^2(2b - 15), and -290b + 2575 as -5(58b - 515). Doesn't seem helpful.Alternatively, maybe try to factor the entire equation as (something)(quadratic). Let me try to factor it.Assume it factors as (pb + q)(rb^2 + sb + t). Let's try p=2, r=4, since 2*4=8.So, (2b + q)(4b^2 + sb + t) = 8b^3 + (2s + 4q)b^2 + (2t + qs)b + qt.Set equal to 8b^3 -60b^2 -290b +2575.So, matching coefficients:8b^3: okay.Next term: 2s + 4q = -60.Next: 2t + qs = -290.Constant term: qt = 2575.So, we have:Equation 1: 2s + 4q = -60.Equation 2: 2t + qs = -290.Equation 3: qt = 2575.We need to find integers q and t such that qt = 2575. Let's factor 2575.2575 divided by 5 is 515.515 divided by 5 is 103.So, 2575 = 5^2 * 103.So, possible pairs for (q, t):(1, 2575), (5, 515), (25, 103), (-1, -2575), (-5, -515), (-25, -103).Let me try q=25, t=103.Then, Equation 1: 2s + 4*25 = 2s + 100 = -60 => 2s = -160 => s = -80.Then, Equation 2: 2*103 + 25*(-80) = 206 - 2000 = -1794 ≠ -290. Not good.Next, q=5, t=515.Equation 1: 2s + 4*5 = 2s + 20 = -60 => 2s = -80 => s = -40.Equation 2: 2*515 + 5*(-40) = 1030 - 200 = 830 ≠ -290. Nope.Next, q=1, t=2575.Equation 1: 2s + 4*1 = 2s + 4 = -60 => 2s = -64 => s = -32.Equation 2: 2*2575 + 1*(-32) = 5150 - 32 = 5118 ≠ -290. Nope.Now, try negative q.q=-25, t=-103.Equation 1: 2s + 4*(-25) = 2s - 100 = -60 => 2s = 40 => s=20.Equation 2: 2*(-103) + (-25)*20 = -206 - 500 = -706 ≠ -290.q=-5, t=-515.Equation 1: 2s + 4*(-5) = 2s -20 = -60 => 2s = -40 => s=-20.Equation 2: 2*(-515) + (-5)*(-20) = -1030 + 100 = -930 ≠ -290.q=-1, t=-2575.Equation 1: 2s + 4*(-1) = 2s -4 = -60 => 2s = -56 => s=-28.Equation 2: 2*(-2575) + (-1)*(-28) = -5150 +28 = -5122 ≠ -290.Hmm, none of these worked. Maybe my initial assumption of p=2 and r=4 is wrong. Maybe try p=4 and r=2.So, (4b + q)(2b^2 + sb + t) = 8b^3 + (4s + 2q)b^2 + (4t + qs)b + qt.Set equal to 8b^3 -60b^2 -290b +2575.So,Equation 1: 4s + 2q = -60.Equation 2: 4t + qs = -290.Equation 3: qt = 2575.Again, possible q and t as before.Let me try q=25, t=103.Equation 1: 4s + 2*25 = 4s + 50 = -60 => 4s = -110 => s = -27.5. Not integer, but maybe possible.Equation 2: 4*103 + 25*(-27.5) = 412 - 687.5 = -275.5 ≠ -290. Close, but not exact.Alternatively, maybe q=5, t=515.Equation 1: 4s + 2*5 = 4s +10 = -60 => 4s = -70 => s = -17.5.Equation 2: 4*515 + 5*(-17.5) = 2060 - 87.5 = 1972.5 ≠ -290.Not helpful.q=1, t=2575.Equation 1: 4s + 2*1 = 4s +2 = -60 => 4s = -62 => s = -15.5.Equation 2: 4*2575 + 1*(-15.5) = 10300 -15.5 = 10284.5 ≠ -290.Nope.Negative q:q=-25, t=-103.Equation 1: 4s + 2*(-25) = 4s -50 = -60 => 4s = -10 => s = -2.5.Equation 2: 4*(-103) + (-25)*(-2.5) = -412 + 62.5 = -349.5 ≠ -290.Close, but not quite.q=-5, t=-515.Equation 1: 4s + 2*(-5) = 4s -10 = -60 => 4s = -50 => s = -12.5.Equation 2: 4*(-515) + (-5)*(-12.5) = -2060 + 62.5 = -1997.5 ≠ -290.Nope.q=-1, t=-2575.Equation 1: 4s + 2*(-1) = 4s -2 = -60 => 4s = -58 => s = -14.5.Equation 2: 4*(-2575) + (-1)*(-14.5) = -10300 +14.5 = -10285.5 ≠ -290.Hmm, not working either. Maybe this approach isn't the way to go.Let me think differently. Maybe the second equation can be transformed into something similar to the first equation.Looking at the second equation: (8b^3 -60b^2 -290b +2575 = 0).Let me try to factor out 8: (8(b^3 - (60/8)b^2 - (290/8)b) +2575 =0), which is (8(b^3 -7.5b^2 -36.25b) +2575=0). Hmm, not helpful.Alternatively, maybe make a substitution like b = something in terms of a.Wait, another idea: Maybe the second equation is related to the first equation with a substitution like b = k - a, where k is a constant. Then, perhaps a + b = k, which is the value we need to find.Let me try that. Let me assume that b = k - a, so that a + b = k. Then, substitute b = k - a into the second equation and see if it can be related to the first equation.So, substituting b = k - a into the second equation:(8(k - a)^3 -60(k - a)^2 -290(k - a) +2575 =0).Let me expand this:First, expand (k - a)^3:= k^3 - 3k^2a + 3ka^2 - a^3Multiply by 8:8k^3 -24k^2a +24ka^2 -8a^3Next, expand -60(k - a)^2:= -60(k^2 - 2ka + a^2) = -60k^2 +120ka -60a^2Then, expand -290(k - a):= -290k +290aSo, putting it all together:8k^3 -24k^2a +24ka^2 -8a^3 -60k^2 +120ka -60a^2 -290k +290a +2575 =0Now, let's collect like terms:Terms with a^3: -8a^3Terms with a^2: 24ka^2 -60a^2 = (24k -60)a^2Terms with a: -24k^2a +120ka +290a = (-24k^2 +120k +290)aConstant terms: 8k^3 -60k^2 -290k +2575So, the equation becomes:-8a^3 + (24k -60)a^2 + (-24k^2 +120k +290)a + (8k^3 -60k^2 -290k +2575) =0Now, we know that a satisfies the first equation: (a^3 -15a^2 +20a -50 =0). So, maybe we can express higher powers of a in terms of lower powers.From the first equation:a^3 =15a^2 -20a +50So, let's substitute a^3 in the second equation:-8(15a^2 -20a +50) + (24k -60)a^2 + (-24k^2 +120k +290)a + (8k^3 -60k^2 -290k +2575) =0Let me compute each term:-8*(15a^2 -20a +50) = -120a^2 +160a -400So, now, the equation becomes:(-120a^2 +160a -400) + (24k -60)a^2 + (-24k^2 +120k +290)a + (8k^3 -60k^2 -290k +2575) =0Now, combine like terms:a^2 terms: (-120 +24k -60) = (24k -180)a terms: (160 -24k^2 +120k +290) = (-24k^2 +120k +450)Constant terms: (-400 +8k^3 -60k^2 -290k +2575) = (8k^3 -60k^2 -290k +2175)So, putting it all together:(24k -180)a^2 + (-24k^2 +120k +450)a + (8k^3 -60k^2 -290k +2175) =0Now, since a satisfies the first equation, which is a cubic, but here we have a quadratic in a. For this equation to hold for all a satisfying the first equation, the coefficients of a^2, a, and the constant term must all be zero. So, set each coefficient to zero:1. Coefficient of a^2: 24k -180 =0 => 24k =180 => k=180/24=7.5=15/2.2. Coefficient of a: -24k^2 +120k +450=0. Let's plug k=15/2 into this:-24*(225/4) +120*(15/2) +450Compute each term:-24*(225/4)= -6*225= -1350120*(15/2)=60*15=900So, total: -1350 +900 +450=0. Perfect.3. Constant term: 8k^3 -60k^2 -290k +2175=0. Let's plug k=15/2:Compute each term:8*(3375/8)=3375-60*(225/4)= -60*(56.25)= -3375-290*(15/2)= -290*7.5= -2175So, total: 3375 -3375 -2175 +2175=0. Perfect.So, all coefficients are zero when k=15/2. Therefore, our assumption that b = k -a with k=15/2 is correct. Therefore, a + b =15/2.So, the answer is 15/2, which is 7.5. In boxed form, that's boxed{dfrac{15}{2}}.**Final Answer**boxed{dfrac{15}{2}}"},{"question":"Eight of the world's top tennis players are divided into two groups at the Shanghai Masters. Each group consists of four players who play a round-robin tournament. The top two players from each group advance, with the first-place player from one group playing the second-place player from the other group in an elimination match. The winners compete for the championship and runner-up positions, while the losers compete for third and fourth place. How many matches are there in total at the Masters?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament. There are eight top players divided into two groups, each with four players. They play a round-robin tournament within their groups. Then, the top two from each group advance, and there are some elimination matches to determine the final standings. I need to figure out how many total matches are played in the tournament.Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, the initial stage is the group stage where each group has four players. Since it's a round-robin, each player plays against every other player in their group. I remember that in a round-robin tournament, the number of matches is calculated by the combination formula C(n, 2), where n is the number of players. So for each group of four players, the number of matches should be C(4, 2).Calculating that, C(4, 2) is 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6 matches per group. Since there are two groups, that would be 6 * 2 = 12 matches in the group stage.Okay, so 12 matches in the group stage. Now, moving on to the next phase. The top two players from each group advance, so that's four players in total. These four players then have some elimination matches. The problem says the first-place player from one group plays the second-place player from the other group. Then, the winners of those matches compete for the championship, and the losers compete for third and fourth place.Let me visualize this. So, Group A has four players, and Group B also has four players. After the group stage, Group A's top two are A1 and A2, and Group B's top two are B1 and B2. Then, A1 plays B2, and A2 plays B1. The winners of these two matches go to the final, and the losers play for third place.Wait, so how many matches does that involve? Let's count them.1. A1 vs B22. A2 vs B1That's two matches. Then, the winners of these two matches play each other in the final, which is the third match. Then, the losers of the first two matches play each other for third place, which is the fourth match.So, in total, after the group stage, there are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 matches. Wait, that seems like 4 matches in the knockout stage.But let me double-check. So, the initial group stage is 12 matches. Then, in the knockout stage, we have two quarterfinals (A1 vs B2 and A2 vs B1), then two semifinals (the winners of those quarterfinals play each other for the final, and the losers play each other for third place). Wait, no, actually, in this case, it's not a standard knockout bracket because the first-place from one group plays the second from the other.So, actually, the matches after the group stage are:- A1 vs B2- A2 vs B1These are two matches. Then, the winners of these two matches play each other in the final. So that's a third match. Then, the losers of the first two matches play each other for third place, which is a fourth match. So, in total, 4 matches after the group stage.Therefore, total matches in the tournament would be group stage matches plus knockout stage matches: 12 + 4 = 16 matches.Wait, but let me think again. Is that all? Or are there more matches?Wait, in the knockout stage, after the two initial matches, the winners go to the final, and the losers go to the third-place match. So, that's two matches in the semifinals, then the final and the third-place match. So, that's four matches in total after the group stage.Yes, so 12 + 4 = 16 matches.But hold on, sometimes in tournaments, the third-place match is considered a consolation match, but regardless, it's still a match that's played. So, it should be counted.Alternatively, sometimes tournaments might not have a third-place match, but in this case, the problem says the losers compete for third and fourth place, so that implies there is a match between them. So, yes, that's a match.Therefore, the total number of matches is 12 (group stage) + 4 (knockout stage) = 16 matches.Wait, but let me think about another way. In a tournament with eight players, how many matches are usually played? Each match eliminates one player, except for the final, which determines the champion. So, to determine a champion, you need to eliminate seven players, which would require seven matches. But in this case, the tournament structure is different because it's group stages followed by knockout.Wait, so perhaps my initial approach is correct because the group stage is a separate phase. So, in the group stage, each group of four plays six matches, so two groups make 12 matches. Then, in the knockout stage, four players remain, and each subsequent match eliminates one player, but we have specific matches as described.Wait, but in the knockout stage, starting from four players, how many matches are needed? To determine the champion, you need three matches: two semifinals and one final. But in this case, we also have a third-place match, so that's four matches in total. So, 12 + 4 = 16.Alternatively, if we consider that each match eliminates one player, starting from eight players, to get down to one champion, you need seven eliminations, which would require seven matches. But in this case, the group stage already eliminates four players, right? Because each group of four plays, and only the top two advance. So, in each group, two players are eliminated, so total of four eliminated in the group stage.Then, in the knockout stage, we have four players. To determine the champion, you need three more eliminations, which would require three matches. But since we have a third-place match, that's an additional match, so four matches in total. So, 12 group stage matches + 4 knockout stage matches = 16.Alternatively, another way to think about it is total number of matches is equal to the total number of players minus the number of byes or something, but I think the way I did it is correct.Wait, let me think about the total number of matches another way. Each match has two players, so each match corresponds to one loss. To determine the final standings (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th), each player except the champion has exactly one loss. But in reality, some players might have more than one loss, especially in the group stage.Wait, maybe that approach is more complicated. Let me stick to the initial method.Group stage: two groups of four, each group plays 6 matches, so 12 matches.Knockout stage: four players, two matches in the first round (A1 vs B2 and A2 vs B1), then two more matches (final and third place), so 4 matches.Total: 12 + 4 = 16.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, let me think about the total number of matches in the entire tournament. Each match is between two players, and each match results in one loss. To determine the final standings, we have 8 players, and we need to assign ranks 1 through 8. Each rank corresponds to a certain number of losses.But in reality, the number of matches is equal to the number of losses, which is equal to the number of players minus one, but only if it's a single-elimination tournament. However, in this case, it's not a single-elimination because of the group stage.Wait, no, the group stage is a round-robin, so each player plays multiple matches, regardless of whether they win or lose. So, the number of matches isn't directly tied to the number of losses in the same way.Therefore, my initial approach is probably the correct way to calculate it: group stage matches plus knockout stage matches.So, 12 group stage matches, 4 knockout stage matches, total of 16.Wait, but let me check if the knockout stage actually has four matches or more.In the knockout stage, after the group stage, we have four players: A1, A2, B1, B2.They play two matches: A1 vs B2 and A2 vs B1.The winners of these two matches play each other in the final.The losers of the two initial matches play each other for third place.So, that's two initial matches, one final, and one third-place match. So, 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 matches.Yes, that's four matches.Therefore, total matches: 12 + 4 = 16.Wait, but sometimes in tournaments, the third-place match isn't counted as part of the main bracket, but in this case, the problem states that the losers compete for third and fourth place, so that match is definitely played.Therefore, 16 matches in total.I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The total number of matches at the Masters is boxed{16}."},{"question":"Given one hundred numbers: (1, frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{3}, frac{1}{4}, ldots, frac{1}{100}). Calculate 98 differences: (a_{1}=1-frac{1}{3}, a_{2}=frac{1}{2}-frac{1}{4}, ldots, a_{98}=frac{1}{98}-frac{1}{100}). What is the sum of all these differences?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given 100 numbers: 1, 1/2, 1/3, all the way up to 1/100. Then, I need to calculate 98 differences, each of which is the difference between two consecutive terms, but not just any two consecutive terms. Specifically, the first difference is a₁ = 1 - 1/3, the second is a₂ = 1/2 - 1/4, and so on, up to a₉₈ = 1/98 - 1/100. Finally, I need to find the sum of all these differences. Hmm, let me try to understand the pattern here. Each aₖ seems to be the difference between the k-th term and the (k+2)-th term in the original sequence. So, for k from 1 to 98, aₖ = 1/k - 1/(k+2). That makes sense because when k is 1, it's 1 - 1/3, and when k is 98, it's 1/98 - 1/100. So, if I have to compute the sum S = a₁ + a₂ + ... + a₉₈, that would be the sum from k=1 to k=98 of (1/k - 1/(k+2)). I think this is a telescoping series because when we expand the terms, a lot of them should cancel out. Let me write out the first few terms and see what happens.Let's compute S step by step:S = (1 - 1/3) + (1/2 - 1/4) + (1/3 - 1/5) + (1/4 - 1/6) + ... + (1/98 - 1/100)Now, let's write them all out:1 - 1/3 + 1/2 - 1/4 + 1/3 - 1/5 + 1/4 - 1/6 + ... + 1/98 - 1/100Looking at this, I can see that many terms will cancel each other out. Let's group them:- The positive terms: 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ..., 1/98- The negative terms: -1/3, -1/4, -1/5, ..., -1/100So, if I write them separately:Positive terms: 1 + 1/2 + (1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/98)Negative terms: (-1/3 - 1/4 - ... -1/98) - 1/99 - 1/100Wait, hold on. Let me check that. The negative terms start from -1/3 and go up to -1/100, right? So, in the positive terms, we have 1, 1/2, and then from 1/3 to 1/98. In the negative terms, we have from -1/3 to -1/100.So, when we combine them, the 1/3 to 1/98 terms in the positive will cancel with the -1/3 to -1/98 terms in the negative. That leaves us with the first two positive terms and the last two negative terms.So, after cancellation, S = 1 + 1/2 - 1/99 - 1/100.Let me verify that. If I have all the terms from 1/3 to 1/98 in positive and negative, they should cancel each other. So, yes, only the first two positive terms (1 and 1/2) and the last two negative terms (-1/99 and -1/100) remain.Therefore, S = 1 + 1/2 - 1/99 - 1/100.Now, let me compute this value.First, 1 + 1/2 is equal to 3/2.Then, 1/99 + 1/100. Let me compute that. To add these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 99 and 100 is 9900.So, 1/99 is equal to 100/9900, and 1/100 is equal to 99/9900. Therefore, 1/99 + 1/100 = (100 + 99)/9900 = 199/9900.So, S = 3/2 - 199/9900.Now, to subtract these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 9900. The least common denominator is 9900.Convert 3/2 to 9900 denominator: 3/2 = (3 * 4950)/(2 * 4950) = 14850/9900.So, S = 14850/9900 - 199/9900 = (14850 - 199)/9900.Compute 14850 - 199:14850 - 200 = 14650, so adding back 1 gives 14651.Therefore, S = 14651/9900.Now, let me see if this fraction can be simplified. Let's check if 14651 and 9900 have any common factors.First, factorize 9900: 9900 = 100 * 99 = 100 * 9 * 11 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 3^2 * 11.Now, check if 14651 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 11.14651 is odd, so not divisible by 2.Sum of digits: 1 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 1 = 17. 17 is not divisible by 3, so 14651 is not divisible by 3.It doesn't end with 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.Check divisibility by 11: The alternating sum of digits: (1 + 6 + 1) - (4 + 5) = (8) - (9) = -1, which is not divisible by 11, so 14651 is not divisible by 11.So, 14651 and 9900 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.Alternatively, we can express this as a mixed number or a decimal, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think leaving it as an improper fraction is fine.Alternatively, let me compute the decimal value to verify.14651 divided by 9900.Well, 9900 goes into 14651 once, since 9900 * 1 = 9900, subtract that from 14651: 14651 - 9900 = 4751.Bring down a zero: 47510.9900 goes into 47510 four times: 4 * 9900 = 39600. Subtract: 47510 - 39600 = 7910.Bring down a zero: 79100.9900 goes into 79100 seven times: 7 * 9900 = 69300. Subtract: 79100 - 69300 = 9800.Bring down a zero: 98000.9900 goes into 98000 nine times: 9 * 9900 = 89100. Subtract: 98000 - 89100 = 8900.Bring down a zero: 89000.9900 goes into 89000 eight times: 8 * 9900 = 79200. Subtract: 89000 - 79200 = 9800.Wait, this is starting to repeat. So, the decimal is approximately 1.480... and then it starts repeating.But since the problem doesn't specify the form, I think the fraction 14651/9900 is acceptable.Alternatively, maybe I can write it as a mixed number: 1 and 4751/9900, but that doesn't seem particularly helpful.Wait, let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from S = sum from k=1 to 98 of (1/k - 1/(k+2)).Expanding the sum:(1 - 1/3) + (1/2 - 1/4) + (1/3 - 1/5) + ... + (1/98 - 1/100)Grouping positive and negative terms:1 + 1/2 + (1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/98) - (1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/98 + 1/99 + 1/100)Yes, so the 1/3 to 1/98 terms cancel, leaving 1 + 1/2 - 1/99 - 1/100.That's correct. So, 1 + 1/2 is 3/2, and 1/99 + 1/100 is 199/9900.So, S = 3/2 - 199/9900.Convert 3/2 to 9900 denominator: 3/2 = 14850/9900.Subtract 199/9900: 14850 - 199 = 14651.So, 14651/9900 is correct.Hmm, 14651 divided by 9900 is approximately 1.480... as I saw earlier.Wait, let me compute 14651 ÷ 9900 more accurately.Compute 9900 * 1.48 = 9900 * 1 + 9900 * 0.48 = 9900 + 4752 = 14652.Wait, that's interesting. So, 9900 * 1.48 = 14652, which is just 1 more than 14651.So, 14651/9900 = 1.48 - 1/9900 ≈ 1.48 - 0.00010101 ≈ 1.47989899.So, approximately 1.4799.But again, unless the problem specifies, the exact fraction is better.So, 14651/9900 is the exact value.Alternatively, maybe we can write it as a mixed number: 1 and 4751/9900, but that's not particularly simpler.Alternatively, maybe we can simplify 4751 and 9900.Wait, 4751: Let's check if it's a prime number or has any factors.4751 divided by 11: 11 * 432 = 4752, which is 1 more than 4751, so 4751 is not divisible by 11.Divide by 13: 13*365=4745, 4751-4745=6, not divisible.17: 17*279=4743, 4751-4743=8, not divisible.19: 19*250=4750, 4751-4750=1, not divisible.23: 23*206=4738, 4751-4738=13, not divisible.29: 29*163=4727, 4751-4727=24, not divisible.31: 31*153=4743, 4751-4743=8, not divisible.37: 37*128=4736, 4751-4736=15, not divisible.41: 41*115=4715, 4751-4715=36, not divisible.43: 43*110=4730, 4751-4730=21, not divisible.47: 47*101=4747, 4751-4747=4, not divisible.53: 53*89=4717, 4751-4717=34, not divisible.59: 59*80=4720, 4751-4720=31, not divisible.61: 61*77=4697, 4751-4697=54, not divisible.67: 67*70=4690, 4751-4690=61, which is prime.So, 4751 is a prime number? Wait, 4751 divided by 7: 7*678=4746, 4751-4746=5, not divisible.So, 4751 seems to be a prime number. Therefore, 4751 and 9900 share no common factors besides 1, so the fraction is indeed in its simplest form.Therefore, the sum S is 14651/9900.Alternatively, if I want to write this as a mixed number, it's 1 and 4751/9900, but as an improper fraction, 14651/9900 is fine.Alternatively, maybe I can write this as a decimal with more precision, but unless specified, the fractional form is probably better.So, to recap:We had 98 differences, each of the form 1/k - 1/(k+2). When we sum all these differences, the series telescopes, leaving only the first two terms (1 and 1/2) and the last two negative terms (-1/99 and -1/100). Adding these together gives 3/2 - 199/9900, which simplifies to 14651/9900.Therefore, the sum of all these differences is 14651/9900.**Final Answer**The sum of all the differences is boxed{dfrac{14651}{9900}}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=sin 2xcos frac {π}{5}-cos 2xsin frac {π}{5}.(I) Find the smallest positive period and the equation of the axis of symmetry of the function f(x);(II) Find the maximum value of the function f(x) on the interval [0, frac {π}{2}].","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = sin(2x)cos(π/5) - cos(2x)sin(π/5). Hmm, I need to find the smallest positive period and the equation of the axis of symmetry for part (I), and then the maximum value on the interval [0, π/2] for part (II). Let me start with part (I).First, looking at the function, it seems like it's a combination of sine and cosine functions with arguments 2x. I remember that there's a sine subtraction formula: sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB. Let me check if this function can be rewritten using that identity.So, if I let A = 2x and B = π/5, then sin(2x - π/5) would be sin(2x)cos(π/5) - cos(2x)sin(π/5). Hey, that's exactly the function f(x)! So, f(x) simplifies to sin(2x - π/5). That should make things easier.Now, for part (I), I need to find the smallest positive period of f(x). Since f(x) is a sine function, its period is generally 2π divided by the coefficient of x inside the sine. In this case, the coefficient is 2, so the period should be 2π / 2 = π. So, the smallest positive period is π.Next, the equation of the axis of symmetry. Hmm, for a sine function, the axis of symmetry is a bit tricky. Wait, actually, sine functions are periodic and symmetric about their midlines. The midline of a sine function is usually the horizontal line that runs through the middle of its oscillation. For the standard sine function, it's y = 0, but if there's a vertical shift, it would be different. However, in this case, f(x) = sin(2x - π/5) doesn't have any vertical shift, so the midline is still y = 0. But wait, is that the axis of symmetry?Wait, maybe I'm confusing the midline with the axis of symmetry. Let me think. For functions like sine and cosine, the axis of symmetry is typically a vertical line where the function is symmetric. But for a standard sine function, it's symmetric about the origin, but that's a point symmetry, not a line. So, maybe it's not the same as for parabolas.Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the vertical line around which the function is symmetric. But sine functions are symmetric about certain lines depending on their phase shift. Let me consider f(x) = sin(2x - π/5). Let me rewrite it as sin[2(x - π/10)]. So, it's a sine function with a horizontal compression by a factor of 2 and a phase shift of π/10 to the right.So, the standard sine function is symmetric about its midline at y=0, but in terms of vertical lines, it's symmetric about the lines where it reaches its maximum, minimum, or crosses the midline. Wait, actually, for a sine function, the axis of symmetry is the vertical line passing through its maximum or minimum points.But since it's a sinusoidal function, it's symmetric about every line where it reaches a peak or a trough. However, the question is asking for the equation of the axis of symmetry. Maybe it's referring to the vertical line where the function reaches its maximum or minimum. Let's find that.The function f(x) = sin(2x - π/5) has its maximum value of 1 when 2x - π/5 = π/2 + 2πk, where k is an integer. Solving for x, we get 2x = π/2 + π/5 + 2πk, so x = (π/2 + π/5)/2 + πk. Let me compute that:π/2 is 5π/10, and π/5 is 2π/10, so together it's 7π/10. Divided by 2, that's 7π/20. So, x = 7π/20 + πk. Similarly, the minimum occurs when 2x - π/5 = 3π/2 + 2πk, so x = (3π/2 + π/5)/2 + πk. Let's compute that:3π/2 is 15π/10, plus π/5 is 2π/10, so 17π/10. Divided by 2 is 17π/20. So, x = 17π/20 + πk.So, the function has vertical lines of symmetry at x = 7π/20 + πk and x = 17π/20 + πk for integers k. But the question asks for the equation of the axis of symmetry. Since it's a periodic function, it has infinitely many axes of symmetry. However, the question might be asking for the principal one, perhaps the one closest to the origin or within a certain interval.But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the function is symmetric about the line x = π/10, which is the phase shift. Let me check.If I consider the function f(x) = sin(2x - π/5) = sin[2(x - π/10)]. So, it's a sine function shifted to the right by π/10. The standard sine function is symmetric about its midline, which is y=0, but in terms of vertical lines, it's symmetric about x = π/10 + (period)/4, which would be the first peak.Wait, the period is π, so the first peak is at x = π/10 + (π)/4 = π/10 + π/4 = (2π/20 + 5π/20) = 7π/20, which matches what I found earlier. So, the axis of symmetry is x = 7π/20, 17π/20, etc. But the question is asking for the equation, so maybe it's x = 7π/20 + kπ/2, but I'm not sure.Wait, perhaps the axis of symmetry is the vertical line where the function reaches its maximum. So, the first maximum is at x = 7π/20, so the axis of symmetry is x = 7π/20. But since it's periodic, there are infinitely many such lines. However, the question might be expecting the general form or the principal one.Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again. For a sinusoidal function, the axis of symmetry is a vertical line where the function is symmetric. For example, for f(x) = sin(x), it's symmetric about x = π/2, x = 3π/2, etc. So, for f(x) = sin(2x - π/5), the axis of symmetry would be at the points where it reaches maximum or minimum, which are x = 7π/20 + kπ/2, where k is integer.But the question says \\"the equation of the axis of symmetry\\". Maybe it's referring to the vertical line that is the axis of symmetry for the entire function, but since it's periodic, it's not a single line but multiple lines. Hmm, perhaps the question is expecting the general form, like x = 7π/20 + kπ/2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the midline, which is y=0, but that's a horizontal line, not vertical.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the function again. f(x) = sin(2x - π/5). The standard sine function is symmetric about its midline, which is y=0, but in terms of vertical lines, it's symmetric about the lines where it reaches its maxima and minima. So, for each maximum and minimum, there's a vertical line of symmetry.But the question is asking for \\"the equation of the axis of symmetry\\", singular. So, perhaps it's referring to the vertical line that is the axis of symmetry for the entire function, but since it's periodic, it's not a single line. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the midline, which is y=0, but that's a horizontal line.Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \\"axis of symmetry\\". In the context of functions, an axis of symmetry is a line about which the function is symmetric. For example, a parabola has a vertical axis of symmetry. For a sine function, it's symmetric about its midline in a certain way, but it's not a vertical line.Wait, perhaps the function f(x) = sin(2x - π/5) can be rewritten in terms of a cosine function, which might make the axis of symmetry more apparent. Let me try that.We know that sin(θ) = cos(θ - π/2). So, f(x) = sin(2x - π/5) = cos(2x - π/5 - π/2) = cos(2x - 7π/10). So, f(x) = cos(2x - 7π/10). Now, cosine functions are symmetric about their peaks. The standard cosine function is symmetric about x=0, but with a phase shift, it's symmetric about x = 7π/20.Wait, let me see. f(x) = cos(2x - 7π/10) = cos[2(x - 7π/20)]. So, it's a cosine function with a horizontal compression by factor 2 and a phase shift of 7π/20 to the right. The standard cosine function is symmetric about x=0, so after shifting, it's symmetric about x = 7π/20. So, the axis of symmetry is x = 7π/20.That makes sense. So, the function f(x) is symmetric about the vertical line x = 7π/20. Therefore, the equation of the axis of symmetry is x = 7π/20.Wait, let me verify that. If I take a point to the left of x = 7π/20, say x = 7π/20 - a, and a point to the right, x = 7π/20 + a, then f(7π/20 - a) should equal f(7π/20 + a). Let me compute f(7π/20 - a):f(7π/20 - a) = sin[2(7π/20 - a) - π/5] = sin(14π/20 - 2a - 4π/20) = sin(10π/20 - 2a) = sin(π/2 - 2a) = cos(2a).Similarly, f(7π/20 + a) = sin[2(7π/20 + a) - π/5] = sin(14π/20 + 2a - 4π/20) = sin(10π/20 + 2a) = sin(π/2 + 2a) = cos(2a). So, yes, f(7π/20 - a) = f(7π/20 + a), which means the function is symmetric about x = 7π/20.Therefore, the axis of symmetry is x = 7π/20.So, for part (I), the smallest positive period is π, and the axis of symmetry is x = 7π/20.Now, moving on to part (II): Find the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [0, π/2].Since f(x) = sin(2x - π/5), the maximum value of sine is 1, so the maximum value of f(x) is 1. However, we need to check if this maximum is achieved within the interval [0, π/2].To find the maximum, we can find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.f'(x) = d/dx [sin(2x - π/5)] = 2cos(2x - π/5).Setting f'(x) = 0: 2cos(2x - π/5) = 0 ⇒ cos(2x - π/5) = 0.Solving for x: 2x - π/5 = π/2 + πk, where k is integer.So, 2x = π/2 + π/5 + πk ⇒ x = (π/2 + π/5)/2 + (π/2)k.Compute (π/2 + π/5): π/2 is 5π/10, π/5 is 2π/10, so together 7π/10. Divided by 2: 7π/20.So, x = 7π/20 + (π/2)k.Now, we need to find all x in [0, π/2] such that x = 7π/20 + (π/2)k.Let me compute 7π/20 ≈ 1.1 radians, and π/2 ≈ 1.57 radians. So, let's see for k=0: x=7π/20 ≈ 1.1, which is less than π/2 ≈ 1.57, so that's within the interval.For k=1: x=7π/20 + π/2 = 7π/20 + 10π/20 = 17π/20 ≈ 2.67, which is greater than π/2, so outside the interval.For k=-1: x=7π/20 - π/2 = 7π/20 - 10π/20 = -3π/20, which is negative, so also outside the interval.Therefore, the only critical point in [0, π/2] is x=7π/20.Now, we need to evaluate f(x) at the critical point and at the endpoints of the interval to find the maximum.Compute f(0): sin(2*0 - π/5) = sin(-π/5) = -sin(π/5) ≈ -0.5878.Compute f(π/2): sin(2*(π/2) - π/5) = sin(π - π/5) = sin(4π/5) ≈ 0.5878.Compute f(7π/20): sin(2*(7π/20) - π/5) = sin(14π/20 - 4π/20) = sin(10π/20) = sin(π/2) = 1.So, the maximum value is 1 at x=7π/20, and the minimum is -sin(π/5) at x=0.Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) on [0, π/2] is 1.Wait, but let me double-check. Since f(x) = sin(2x - π/5), and at x=7π/20, it's sin(π/2) = 1, which is indeed the maximum. So, yes, the maximum value is 1.So, summarizing:(I) The smallest positive period is π, and the axis of symmetry is x = 7π/20.(II) The maximum value on [0, π/2] is 1.**Final Answer**(I) The smallest positive period is boxed{pi} and the equation of the axis of symmetry is boxed{x = dfrac{7pi}{20}}.(II) The maximum value of the function on the interval ([0, dfrac{pi}{2}]) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"After a math test, the scores of 40 students in a class were divided into 5 groups.

If (CE) intersects the line (AD) at (P), and (PF) intersects (BC) at (Q), determine the ratio of (BQ) to (CQ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a rectangle (ABCD). Points (E) and (F) are on side (AB) such that (AE = EF = FB). Then, lines (CE) and (PF) intersect (AD) at (P) and (BC) at (Q) respectively. I need to find the ratio ( frac{BQ}{CQ} ).First, let me visualize the rectangle. Let me label the rectangle with (A) at the bottom left, (B) at the bottom right, (C) at the top right, and (D) at the top left. So, sides (AB) and (CD) are the bases, and (AD) and (BC) are the heights.Points (E) and (F) are on (AB), dividing it into three equal parts. So, (AE = EF = FB). That means if the length of (AB) is, say, 3 units, then each segment (AE), (EF), and (FB) is 1 unit each. I can assign coordinates to the rectangle to make this easier.Let me assign coordinates to each point. Let me set point (A) at ((0, 0)). Since (ABCD) is a rectangle, if (AB) is along the x-axis, then (B) will be at ((3, 0)), (C) at ((3, h)), and (D) at ((0, h)), where (h) is the height of the rectangle. I can assume (h) is some positive number, maybe 1 for simplicity, but I might need to keep it as a variable.Wait, actually, since ratios are involved, the actual lengths might not matter, so maybe I can set (AB = 3) units and (AD = h) units. But I think using coordinates with specific values might make it easier. Let me set (AB = 3) and (AD = 1) for simplicity. So, coordinates:- (A(0, 0))- (B(3, 0))- (C(3, 1))- (D(0, 1))Points (E) and (F) are on (AB), so their coordinates will be:- (E) is 1 unit from (A), so (E(1, 0))- (F) is 2 units from (A), so (F(2, 0))Now, line (CE) intersects (AD) at (P). Let me find the equation of line (CE). Point (C) is at ((3, 1)) and point (E) is at ((1, 0)).The slope of (CE) is (m = frac{0 - 1}{1 - 3} = frac{-1}{-2} = frac{1}{2}).So, the equation of line (CE) is (y - 1 = frac{1}{2}(x - 3)).Simplifying, (y = frac{1}{2}x - frac{3}{2} + 1 = frac{1}{2}x - frac{1}{2}).Now, line (AD) is the side from (A(0, 0)) to (D(0, 1)), which is the y-axis at (x = 0). So, to find point (P), set (x = 0) in the equation of (CE):(y = frac{1}{2}(0) - frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{2}).Wait, that can't be right because point (P) is on (AD), which is from ((0, 0)) to ((0, 1)). But the y-coordinate is negative, which is below (A). That doesn't make sense because line (CE) goes from (C(3, 1)) to (E(1, 0)), so it should intersect (AD) above (A), not below.Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the equation of line (CE). Let me check again.Slope (m = frac{0 - 1}{1 - 3} = frac{-1}{-2} = frac{1}{2}). That seems correct.Equation using point (C(3, 1)):(y - 1 = frac{1}{2}(x - 3))So, (y = frac{1}{2}x - frac{3}{2} + 1)Simplify: (y = frac{1}{2}x - frac{1}{2}). Hmm, that still gives me (y = -frac{1}{2}) when (x = 0). But that's below the rectangle.Wait, maybe I need to consider the parametric equations instead because perhaps the line extends beyond the rectangle.Wait, but in the problem statement, it says (CE) intersects (AD) at (P). So, if (CE) is drawn from (C) to (E), it should intersect (AD) somewhere. But according to my calculation, it's intersecting at ((0, -frac{1}{2})), which is outside the rectangle.This suggests that maybe my coordinate system is flipped or something. Wait, no, in my coordinate system, (A) is at ((0, 0)), (B) is at ((3, 0)), (C) is at ((3, 1)), and (D) is at ((0, 1)). So, line (CE) goes from ((3, 1)) to ((1, 0)). If I plot this, it should intersect (AD) somewhere above (A), but according to the equation, it's going below.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the slope. Let me recalculate the slope.Slope (m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{0 - 1}{1 - 3} = frac{-1}{-2} = frac{1}{2}). That's correct.So, equation is (y = frac{1}{2}x + b). Plugging in point (C(3, 1)):(1 = frac{1}{2}(3) + b)(1 = frac{3}{2} + b)(b = 1 - frac{3}{2} = -frac{1}{2})So, equation is (y = frac{1}{2}x - frac{1}{2}). So, when (x = 0), (y = -frac{1}{2}). Hmm, that's correct, but it's outside the rectangle.Wait, so maybe the line (CE) doesn't intersect (AD) within the rectangle? But the problem says it does at point (P). Maybe I need to extend (AD) beyond (A). But in the rectangle, (AD) is from (A(0,0)) to (D(0,1)). So, if we extend (AD) beyond (A), it goes into negative y-values. So, point (P) is at ((0, -frac{1}{2})).Wait, but in the problem statement, it says (CE) intersects the line (AD) at (P). So, maybe (AD) is considered as an infinite line, not just the segment. So, (P) is indeed at ((0, -frac{1}{2})).Okay, so point (P) is at ((0, -frac{1}{2})). Now, moving on to line (PF). Point (F) is at ((2, 0)). So, line (PF) connects (P(0, -frac{1}{2})) and (F(2, 0)).Let me find the equation of line (PF). First, calculate the slope:(m = frac{0 - (-frac{1}{2})}{2 - 0} = frac{frac{1}{2}}{2} = frac{1}{4}).So, the slope is (frac{1}{4}). Using point (F(2, 0)):(y - 0 = frac{1}{4}(x - 2))So, (y = frac{1}{4}x - frac{1}{2}).Now, this line (PF) intersects (BC) at point (Q). Side (BC) is from (B(3, 0)) to (C(3, 1)), which is the vertical line (x = 3). So, to find (Q), set (x = 3) in the equation of (PF):(y = frac{1}{4}(3) - frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{4} - frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{4}).So, point (Q) is at ((3, frac{1}{4})).Now, I need to find the ratio ( frac{BQ}{CQ} ). Points (B), (Q), and (C) are all on side (BC). Since (BC) is a vertical segment from ((3, 0)) to ((3, 1)), the distance from (B) to (Q) is the difference in y-coordinates, and similarly for (C) to (Q).Point (B) is at ((3, 0)), (Q) is at ((3, frac{1}{4})), and (C) is at ((3, 1)).So, (BQ = frac{1}{4} - 0 = frac{1}{4}).(CQ = 1 - frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4}).Therefore, the ratio ( frac{BQ}{CQ} = frac{frac{1}{4}}{frac{3}{4}} = frac{1}{3} ).Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps.1. Assigned coordinates correctly.2. Calculated slope of (CE) correctly as (1/2).3. Equation of (CE) is (y = frac{1}{2}x - frac{1}{2}).4. Intersection with (AD) (x=0) gives (P(0, -frac{1}{2})).5. Calculated slope of (PF) as (1/4).6. Equation of (PF) is (y = frac{1}{4}x - frac{1}{2}).7. Intersection with (BC) (x=3) gives (Q(3, frac{1}{4})).8. Calculated distances (BQ = frac{1}{4}) and (CQ = frac{3}{4}).9. Ratio (1/3).Seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can use vectors or coordinate geometry another way.Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles.Looking back, when line (CE) intersects (AD) at (P), which is below (A). Then line (PF) goes from (P) to (F) and intersects (BC) at (Q). So, perhaps using similar triangles in the extended lines.But since I already got the ratio as (1/3) through coordinate geometry, and all steps check out, I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The ratio of (BQ) to (CQ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{3}}."},{"question":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, if a_1=2 and a_9=8, then a_5= ___.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me first recall what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, in general, the nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as:a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1)Here, a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.The problem says that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_1 is 2 and a_9 is 8. I need to find a_5.Alright, let's write down what we know. The first term, a_1, is 2. The ninth term, a_9, is 8. So, using the formula for the nth term:a_9 = a_1 * r^(9-1) = a_1 * r^8Plugging in the known values:8 = 2 * r^8So, I can solve for r. Let me do that step by step.First, divide both sides by 2:8 / 2 = r^84 = r^8So, r^8 = 4. Hmm, to find r, I need to take the eighth root of 4. But 4 is 2 squared, so maybe I can express this in terms of exponents with base 2.4 = 2^2, so:r^8 = 2^2Taking the eighth root of both sides:r = (2^2)^(1/8) = 2^(2/8) = 2^(1/4)So, r is 2 raised to the 1/4 power, which is the fourth root of 2. Alternatively, r could be negative because even roots can have negative solutions. But in a geometric sequence, the common ratio can be positive or negative. However, since the terms are given as positive (2 and 8), it's more likely that r is positive. So, I'll take r = 2^(1/4).But let me just confirm. If r were negative, say r = -2^(1/4), then the terms would alternate in sign. Since a_1 is positive, a_2 would be negative, a_3 positive, and so on. But a_9 is positive, which is the 9th term. Since 9 is odd, a_9 would be positive if r is positive or negative. So, actually, r could be positive or negative. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the terms are positive or negative beyond a_1 and a_9. Since a_1 is 2 and a_9 is 8, both positive, but the terms in between could be negative or positive depending on r. So, r could be positive or negative. However, since the problem is asking for a_5, which is the fifth term, and 5 is odd, so if r is negative, a_5 would be positive as well because (-r)^4 is positive, so a_5 = a_1 * r^4, which is positive regardless. So, whether r is positive or negative, a_5 will be positive. So, maybe it doesn't matter for the value of a_5.But let's see. Let's proceed with r = 2^(1/4) and see what happens. If I get a consistent answer, maybe that's the only solution they are expecting.So, r = 2^(1/4). So, that's the fourth root of 2.Now, I need to find a_5. Using the formula again:a_5 = a_1 * r^(5-1) = a_1 * r^4We know a_1 is 2, so:a_5 = 2 * (2^(1/4))^4Simplify the exponent:(2^(1/4))^4 = 2^(1/4 * 4) = 2^1 = 2So, a_5 = 2 * 2 = 4Wait, that seems straightforward. So, a_5 is 4.But let me check if I considered the negative ratio. Suppose r = -2^(1/4). Then, a_5 would be:a_5 = 2 * (-2^(1/4))^4But (-2^(1/4))^4 is equal to (2^(1/4))^4 because the exponent is even, so the negative sign would be eliminated. So, again:(-2^(1/4))^4 = (2^(1/4))^4 = 2^(1) = 2So, a_5 = 2 * 2 = 4 regardless of whether r is positive or negative. So, either way, a_5 is 4.Therefore, the answer is 4.But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Start with a_1 = 2, a_9 = 8.2. Use the formula for the nth term: a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1).3. For a_9: 8 = 2 * r^8. Divide both sides by 2: 4 = r^8.4. Solve for r: r = ±4^(1/8). Wait, hold on, 4 is 2^2, so r^8 = 2^2. So, r = ±(2^2)^(1/8) = ±2^(2/8) = ±2^(1/4). So, that's correct.5. Then, for a_5: a_5 = 2 * r^4.6. Since r^4 = (2^(1/4))^4 = 2^(1) = 2, whether r is positive or negative, r^4 is positive 2.7. So, a_5 = 2 * 2 = 4.Yes, that all seems correct. So, I think 4 is the right answer.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that in a geometric sequence, the term halfway between a_1 and a_9 is a_5. Since the sequence is geometric, the geometric mean of a_1 and a_9 should be a_5.The geometric mean of two numbers, x and y, is sqrt(x*y). But in this case, since there are 8 intervals between a_1 and a_9, the number of terms is 9, so the middle term is a_5. The geometric mean would be (a_1 * a_9)^(1/8) or something? Wait, maybe not exactly.Wait, actually, in a geometric sequence, each term is the geometric mean of the terms equidistant from it. So, a_5 is the geometric mean of a_1 and a_9.So, a_5 = sqrt(a_1 * a_9) = sqrt(2 * 8) = sqrt(16) = 4.Oh, that's another way to see it. So, that confirms the answer is 4.So, whether I approach it by finding the common ratio and computing a_5, or by recognizing that a_5 is the geometric mean of a_1 and a_9, I get the same result, 4.Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 4.**Final Answer**The fifth term of the geometric sequence is boxed{4}."},{"question":"The corner of a unit cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the vertex of the chosen corner.  What is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the height of a unit cube after chopping off one corner. The cut goes through the three vertices adjacent to the chosen corner. Then, I have to place this freshly-cut face on a table and find the height of the remaining cube. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, a unit cube has sides of length 1. Each corner is a vertex where three edges meet. If I choose one corner, say the origin (0,0,0), then the three adjacent vertices would be (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The problem says the cut runs through these three vertices, so the cut is a plane passing through (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). That makes sense.So, when I make this cut, I'm removing a tetrahedron from the cube. The remaining part is the cube minus this tetrahedron. Now, I need to place this new face (the cut face) on a table and find the height of the cube in this position. The height would be the maximum distance from the table to the highest point of the cube.Let me think about how to model this. The table is supporting the cube on the cut face, so the cube is resting on this triangular face. I need to find the perpendicular distance from this face to the opposite vertex of the cube, which is the farthest point from the face.Wait, actually, the opposite vertex from the cut corner is (1,1,1), right? Because the original corner was (0,0,0), and the opposite corner is (1,1,1). But when we cut off the corner, the opposite vertex is still (1,1,1). So, maybe the height is the distance from the plane (the cut face) to the point (1,1,1).But I need to confirm that. Let me think: when the cube is placed on the cut face, the height would be the distance from the table (which is the plane of the cut face) to the highest point of the cube, which is (1,1,1). So yes, the height should be the distance from the plane to (1,1,1).Alternatively, maybe it's the distance from the plane to the farthest vertex, which is (1,1,1). So, I need to find the equation of the plane passing through (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), and then compute the distance from this plane to the point (1,1,1).Let me recall the formula for the distance from a point to a plane. The distance D from a point (x0, y0, z0) to the plane ax + by + cz + d = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).First, I need the equation of the plane passing through (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). Let me find that.The general equation of a plane is ax + by + cz = d. Since the plane passes through (1,0,0), substituting gives a*1 + b*0 + c*0 = d => a = d.Similarly, plugging in (0,1,0) gives b = d, and (0,0,1) gives c = d. So, a = b = c = d.Let me denote d as k, so a = b = c = k. Then the equation is kx + ky + kz = k. We can divide both sides by k (assuming k ≠ 0, which it isn't because otherwise the plane equation would be 0=0, which isn't a plane). So, the equation simplifies to x + y + z = 1.So, the plane equation is x + y + z = 1.Now, the point we are interested in is (1,1,1). Let's compute the distance from this point to the plane.Using the distance formula:D = |1 + 1 + 1 - 1| / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = |2| / sqrt(3) = 2 / sqrt(3).But wait, let me double-check. The plane equation is x + y + z = 1, so in standard form, it's x + y + z - 1 = 0. So, a=1, b=1, c=1, d=-1.So, plugging into the distance formula:D = |1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 - 1| / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1) = |1 + 1 + 1 - 1| / sqrt(3) = |2| / sqrt(3) = 2/sqrt(3).Yes, that's correct. So, the distance is 2/sqrt(3). But let me rationalize the denominator: 2/sqrt(3) = (2*sqrt(3))/3.So, the height is 2*sqrt(3)/3.Wait, hold on. Is this the height? Because when the cube is placed on the cut face, the height is the perpendicular distance from the plane to the highest point, which is (1,1,1). So, yes, that should be the height.But let me think again: is (1,1,1) the farthest point from the plane? Because the cube has other vertices as well. For example, the vertices (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) are also part of the cube. Are any of these farther from the plane than (1,1,1)?Let me compute the distance from the plane to (1,1,0):D = |1 + 1 + 0 - 1| / sqrt(3) = |1| / sqrt(3) = 1/sqrt(3).Similarly, for (1,0,1):D = |1 + 0 + 1 - 1| / sqrt(3) = |1| / sqrt(3) = 1/sqrt(3).Same for (0,1,1):D = |0 + 1 + 1 - 1| / sqrt(3) = |1| / sqrt(3) = 1/sqrt(3).So, indeed, (1,1,1) is the farthest point from the plane, with a distance of 2/sqrt(3). Therefore, the height of the cube when resting on the cut face is 2/sqrt(3), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(3)/3.Wait, but let me think about the cube's orientation. When we place the cut face on the table, the cube might not be resting on just the plane; it's a flat face, so the height should be the maximum distance from the table to any point on the cube. Since (1,1,1) is the farthest, that should be the height.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the centroid or something else, but no, height is the maximum distance from the supporting face to the highest point.Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the cube's geometry. The cut removes a tetrahedron, and the remaining solid is a cube with a corner cut off. The height when resting on the cut face would be the distance from that face to the opposite vertex.Wait, another way to think about it is to find the normal vector of the cut face and then compute how high the opposite vertex is along that normal.The normal vector to the plane x + y + z = 1 is (1,1,1). So, the direction of the normal is along (1,1,1). The height would be the projection of the vector from a point on the plane to (1,1,1) onto the normal vector.Let me pick a point on the plane, say (1,0,0). The vector from (1,0,0) to (1,1,1) is (0,1,1). The projection of this vector onto the normal vector (1,1,1) is [(0,1,1) • (1,1,1)] / |(1,1,1)|.The dot product is 0*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 2. The magnitude of the normal vector is sqrt(1 + 1 + 1) = sqrt(3). So, the projection is 2 / sqrt(3), which is the same as before.Therefore, the height is 2/sqrt(3) or 2*sqrt(3)/3.Wait, but let me make sure that this is indeed the height. Since the cube is resting on the cut face, which is a triangle, the height should be the maximum distance from the table to any point on the cube. Since (1,1,1) is the farthest point, and we've calculated the distance as 2*sqrt(3)/3, that should be the height.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the cube's space diagonal. The space diagonal of a unit cube is sqrt(3). The cut removes a portion of this diagonal. The distance from the cut face to the opposite corner is 2/sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.1547, which is less than sqrt(3) (~1.732). That seems reasonable because we've cut off a corner.Wait, another way to think about it: the centroid of the cut face is at the average of (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1), which is (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). The vector from the centroid to (1,1,1) is (2/3, 2/3, 2/3). The length of this vector is sqrt( (2/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 + (2/3)^2 ) = sqrt(12/9) = sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3). So, that's another way to get the same result.Therefore, I think 2/sqrt(3) is correct, which is equal to 2*sqrt(3)/3.Wait, but let me think about the cube's orientation again. When placed on the cut face, is the height really just the distance from the plane to (1,1,1)? Or is there some component due to the cube's other dimensions?Hmm, no, because the cube is resting on the plane, and the height is measured perpendicularly from the plane to the highest point. So, yes, it's just the distance from the plane to (1,1,1), which is 2*sqrt(3)/3.Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me set up a coordinate system where the table is the plane x + y + z = 1, and I want to find the maximum z-coordinate (or whatever coordinate) when projecting along the normal vector.Wait, actually, the height is along the normal vector direction. So, if I consider the normal vector (1,1,1), the height is the scalar projection of the vector from a point on the plane to (1,1,1) onto the normal vector.As I calculated earlier, that projection is 2/sqrt(3). So, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can use linear algebra. The height can be found by finding the maximum value of the function f(x,y,z) = x + y + z over the cube, subject to the constraint that the cube is placed on the plane x + y + z = 1. Wait, no, that might not be the right approach.Wait, actually, the height is the maximum value of the dot product of the position vector with the unit normal vector. The unit normal vector is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3). So, the height is the maximum value of (x + y + z)/sqrt(3) over the cube, minus the value on the plane.Wait, the plane x + y + z = 1 has a value of 1 for x + y + z. The maximum value of x + y + z on the cube is 3 (at (1,1,1)), so the difference is 3 - 1 = 2. Then, divided by sqrt(3), gives 2/sqrt(3). So, that's another way to get the same result.Yes, that makes sense. So, the height is 2/sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.1547.Wait, but let me think about the cube's dimensions. The unit cube has edges of length 1, so the space diagonal is sqrt(3), which is about 1.732. The height we're calculating is less than that, which makes sense because we're measuring from a face to a vertex, not along the space diagonal.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the cube being oriented such that the cut face is on the table, and then find the height by considering the cube's orientation. The height would be the length of the cube along the direction perpendicular to the cut face.Since the cut face is a plane with normal vector (1,1,1), the height is the component of the cube's space diagonal along this normal vector. The space diagonal is from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1), which has length sqrt(3). The component along (1,1,1) is the projection, which is (1,1,1) • (1,1,1)/|normal| = 3 / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3). Wait, that's the length of the space diagonal. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.Wait, no, the projection of the space diagonal onto the normal vector is indeed sqrt(3), but that's the length of the space diagonal itself. However, the height we're looking for is the distance from the plane to the opposite vertex, which is 2/sqrt(3). So, perhaps that's a different measure.Wait, maybe I can think of the cube as being sheared or something, but I think the distance from the plane to the vertex is the correct measure for the height.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the height of a tetrahedron. Wait, the cut-off part is a regular tetrahedron? No, actually, the tetrahedron has edges of length sqrt(2) because the edges from (0,0,0) to (1,0,0), etc., are length 1, but the edges between (1,0,0), (0,1,0), etc., are sqrt(2). So, it's not a regular tetrahedron.Wait, but maybe the height of the remaining solid is related to the height of this tetrahedron. Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the cube in terms of coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the cube with the cut face on the table. The cut face is the triangle with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). If I place this face on the table, which I can consider as the xy-plane, but rotated.Wait, actually, the plane x + y + z = 1 is not aligned with any axis, so it's a bit more complex. Maybe I need to perform a coordinate transformation to align the cut face with the xy-plane, and then find the z-coordinate of (1,1,1) in this new coordinate system.That might be a bit involved, but let's try.First, let me find a coordinate system where the cut face lies on the new xy-plane. To do this, I need to find a basis where the normal vector (1,1,1) is the new z-axis.Let me denote the original coordinates as (x, y, z). I need to rotate the coordinate system so that the vector (1,1,1) becomes the new z-axis. This involves finding an orthonormal basis where one of the basis vectors is (1,1,1)/sqrt(3).Let me denote the new coordinates as (u, v, w), where w is along (1,1,1). Then, the transformation from (x, y, z) to (u, v, w) involves rotating the axes.But this might be a bit too involved for my current level of understanding. Maybe there's a simpler way.Alternatively, since the height is the distance from the plane to the point (1,1,1), which we've already calculated as 2/sqrt(3), maybe that's sufficient.Wait, but let me think about the cube's orientation again. When placed on the cut face, the cube is resting on three points: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The height is the maximum distance from the table to any point on the cube, which is indeed (1,1,1). So, the distance from the plane to (1,1,1) is the height.Therefore, I think 2/sqrt(3) is the correct answer, which simplifies to 2*sqrt(3)/3.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. The plane equation is x + y + z = 1. The distance from (1,1,1) to this plane is |1 + 1 + 1 - 1| / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1) = |2| / sqrt(3) = 2/sqrt(3). Yes, that's correct.So, the height is 2/sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.1547. Since the cube is a unit cube, this height is greater than 1, which makes sense because the cube is now resting on a corner, effectively increasing its height beyond the original edge length.Wait, but hold on. The original cube has a height of 1 when resting on a face. When resting on an edge, the height becomes sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707, but that's actually less. Wait, no, when resting on an edge, the height is the distance from the edge to the opposite edge, which is sqrt(2)/2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.Wait, no, when resting on a face, the height is 1. When resting on an edge, the height is the distance from the edge to the opposite edge, which is sqrt(2)/2. When resting on a corner, the height is sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.577. Wait, but in our case, we're not resting on a corner, but on a face that's a triangle. So, the height is different.Wait, actually, in our case, the height is 2/sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.1547, which is greater than 1. That seems counterintuitive because when you rest on a face, you'd expect the height to be less than or equal to 1. But in this case, the face is not a standard face of the cube, but a cut face, so it's possible that the height is greater than 1.Wait, let me think about the cube's orientation. When you place the cube on the cut face, which is a triangle, the cube is effectively standing on one of its corners, but the cut face is a larger face, so the height is actually increased.Wait, no, the cut face is a triangle, but it's a flat face, so the cube is resting stably on it. The height is the distance from this face to the farthest point, which is (1,1,1). So, yes, it's 2/sqrt(3), which is about 1.1547.Wait, but let me think about the cube's geometry again. The original cube has edges of length 1. The cut removes a tetrahedron, and the remaining solid has a new face. The height when resting on this new face is the distance from this face to the opposite vertex.Yes, that makes sense. So, I think my calculation is correct.Therefore, the height is 2/sqrt(3), which can be rationalized as 2*sqrt(3)/3.So, the final answer is 2*sqrt(3)/3.**Final Answer**The height of the remaining cube when placed on the freshly-cut face is boxed{dfrac{2sqrt{3}}{3}}."},{"question":"An arithmetic sequence has 2036 terms labeled ( t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, ldots, t_{2035}, t_{2036} ).

Determine the value of ( t_{2000} + 5t_{2015} + 5t_{2021} + t_{2036} ).(An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant, called the common difference.)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence with 2036 terms. The 2018th term is given as 100, and I need to find the value of ( t_{2000} + 5t_{2015} + 5t_{2021} + t_{2036} ). Hmm, arithmetic sequences, right? Each term is obtained by adding a constant difference. Let me recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.The nth term, ( t_n ), can be expressed as:[ t_n = t_1 + (n - 1)d ]where ( t_1 ) is the first term and ( d ) is the common difference.Given that ( t_{2018} = 100 ), I can write:[ t_{2018} = t_1 + (2018 - 1)d = t_1 + 2017d = 100 ]So, ( t_1 + 2017d = 100 ). That's one equation, but I don't know either ( t_1 ) or ( d ). Hmm, maybe I don't need to find them individually. Let me see what the problem is asking for.I need to compute ( t_{2000} + 5t_{2015} + 5t_{2021} + t_{2036} ). Let me write each term using the formula for the nth term.First, ( t_{2000} = t_1 + (2000 - 1)d = t_1 + 1999d ).Next, ( t_{2015} = t_1 + (2015 - 1)d = t_1 + 2014d ).Then, ( t_{2021} = t_1 + (2021 - 1)d = t_1 + 2020d ).Lastly, ( t_{2036} = t_1 + (2036 - 1)d = t_1 + 2035d ).So, substituting these into the expression we need to compute:[ t_{2000} + 5t_{2015} + 5t_{2021} + t_{2036} = (t_1 + 1999d) + 5(t_1 + 2014d) + 5(t_1 + 2020d) + (t_1 + 2035d) ]Let me expand this expression:First, distribute the 5s:[ = t_1 + 1999d + 5t_1 + 5 times 2014d + 5t_1 + 5 times 2020d + t_1 + 2035d ]Now, let me compute the coefficients for ( t_1 ) and ( d ) separately.For ( t_1 ):- There's 1 from ( t_{2000} )- 5 from ( 5t_{2015} )- 5 from ( 5t_{2021} )- 1 from ( t_{2036} )So total ( t_1 ) terms: 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12.For ( d ):- 1999 from ( t_{2000} )- 5 × 2014 from ( 5t_{2015} )- 5 × 2020 from ( 5t_{2021} )- 2035 from ( t_{2036} )So let me compute each part:- 5 × 2014: 2014 × 5. Let me compute that: 2000 × 5 = 10,000; 14 × 5 = 70; so total 10,070.- 5 × 2020: 2020 × 5 = 10,100.So, the coefficients for ( d ) are:1999 + 10,070 + 10,100 + 2035.Let me compute that step by step:1999 + 10,070 = 12,06912,069 + 10,100 = 22,16922,169 + 2035 = 24,204So, putting it all together, the expression becomes:[ 12t_1 + 24,204d ]Hmm, so I have ( 12t_1 + 24,204d ). I need to find this value. But I only know that ( t_1 + 2017d = 100 ). Maybe I can express ( 12t_1 + 24,204d ) in terms of ( t_1 + 2017d ).Let me factor out 12 from the expression:Wait, 24,204 divided by 12 is 2017. Let me check:2017 × 12 = 24,204. Yes, because 2000 × 12 = 24,000 and 17 × 12 = 204, so 24,000 + 204 = 24,204.So, ( 12t_1 + 24,204d = 12(t_1 + 2017d) ).But from earlier, ( t_1 + 2017d = 100 ). So substituting that in:[ 12(t_1 + 2017d) = 12 times 100 = 1200 ]So, the value of ( t_{2000} + 5t_{2015} + 5t_{2021} + t_{2036} ) is 1200.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I wrote each term correctly using the arithmetic sequence formula. Then, I expanded the expression, which gave me 12t1 and 24,204d. Then, I noticed that 24,204 is 12 × 2017, which is exactly the coefficient from the known term ( t_{2018} = 100 ). So, factoring out 12 gives me 12 times 100, which is 1200. That seems correct.I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just verify the coefficients again:For ( t_1 ): 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12. Correct.For ( d ):- 1999 (from 2000th term)- 5 × 2014 = 10,070- 5 × 2020 = 10,100- 2035 (from 2036th term)Adding those: 1999 + 10,070 = 12,069; 12,069 + 10,100 = 22,169; 22,169 + 2035 = 24,204. Correct.24,204 divided by 12 is indeed 2017, which is the coefficient in ( t_{2018} ). So, 12 × 100 = 1200. That seems solid.I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{1200}"},{"question":"Given {a_{n}} is a positive geometric sequence, if a_{2}+a_{6}=10, a_{4}a_{8}=64, then a_{4}=left(  right)A: 6B: 4C: 2D: sqrt{2}","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me see... It says that {a_n} is a positive geometric sequence. Hmm, I remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, if I denote the first term as a and the common ratio as r, then the nth term is a_n = a * r^(n-1). The problem gives me two pieces of information: a_2 + a_6 = 10, and a_4 * a_8 = 64. I need to find a_4. The options are A: 6, B: 4, C: 2, D: sqrt(2). Let me write down what I know.First, let's express each term in terms of a and r.a_2 = a * r^(2-1) = a * ra_6 = a * r^(6-1) = a * r^5a_4 = a * r^(4-1) = a * r^3a_8 = a * r^(8-1) = a * r^7So, from the first equation: a_2 + a_6 = 10, which translates to:a*r + a*r^5 = 10I can factor out a*r:a*r*(1 + r^4) = 10Okay, that's equation one.The second equation is a_4 * a_8 = 64. Plugging in the expressions:(a*r^3) * (a*r^7) = 64Multiply those together:a^2 * r^(3+7) = a^2 * r^10 = 64So, equation two is a^2 * r^10 = 64.Now, I have two equations:1) a*r*(1 + r^4) = 102) a^2 * r^10 = 64Hmm, I need to solve for a and r. Maybe I can express a from equation 2 and substitute into equation 1.From equation 2: a^2 * r^10 = 64. Let's solve for a.Take square roots on both sides:a * r^5 = sqrt(64) = 8So, a = 8 / r^5Okay, so a is 8 divided by r^5. Now, plug this into equation 1.Equation 1: a*r*(1 + r^4) = 10Substitute a:(8 / r^5) * r * (1 + r^4) = 10Simplify:(8 / r^5) * r = 8 / r^4So, 8 / r^4 * (1 + r^4) = 10Multiply through:8*(1 + r^4)/r^4 = 10Let me write that as:8*(1 + r^4) = 10*r^4Divide both sides by 2:4*(1 + r^4) = 5*r^4Expand the left side:4 + 4*r^4 = 5*r^4Subtract 4*r^4 from both sides:4 = r^4So, r^4 = 4Therefore, r = 4^(1/4). Since the sequence is positive, r must be positive. 4^(1/4) is the same as sqrt(2), because sqrt(2)^4 = (2^(1/2))^4 = 2^(2) = 4. So, r = sqrt(2).Now that I have r, I can find a.From earlier, a = 8 / r^5Since r = sqrt(2), r^5 = (sqrt(2))^5 = 2^(5/2) = 2^2 * 2^(1/2) = 4*sqrt(2)So, a = 8 / (4*sqrt(2)) = (8 / 4) / sqrt(2) = 2 / sqrt(2)Simplify 2 / sqrt(2): multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):(2*sqrt(2)) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = (2*sqrt(2)) / 2 = sqrt(2)So, a = sqrt(2)Now, I need to find a_4, which is a*r^3.Compute a*r^3:sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2))^3First, (sqrt(2))^3 = (2^(1/2))^3 = 2^(3/2) = 2*sqrt(2)So, sqrt(2) * 2*sqrt(2) = 2*(sqrt(2))^2 = 2*2 = 4Therefore, a_4 is 4.

That seems correct.2. Set up the equations:a*r + a*r^5 = 10 => a*r*(1 + r^4) = 10a^2*r^10 = 643. Solved equation 2 for a: a = 8 / r^54. Substituted into equation 1:(8 / r^5)*r*(1 + r^4) = 10 => 8*(1 + r^4)/r^4 = 10Wait, let me verify that step:(8 / r^5)*r = 8 / r^4, correct.Then, 8 / r^4 * (1 + r^4) = 10, correct.So, 8*(1 + r^4) = 10*r^4, yes.4*(1 + r^4) = 5*r^44 + 4r^4 = 5r^44 = r^4, so r = sqrt(2). Correct.Then, a = 8 / r^5 = 8 / (sqrt(2))^5(sqrt(2))^5 = (2^(1/2))^5 = 2^(5/2) = 4*sqrt(2), correct.So, a = 8 / (4*sqrt(2)) = 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). Correct.Then, a_4 = a*r^3 = sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2))^3(sqrt(2))^3 = 2*sqrt(2), so sqrt(2)*2*sqrt(2) = 2*(sqrt(2))^2 = 2*2 = 4. Correct.So, all steps seem solid.

If f(-3) = -1, then f(3) = ______________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = ax³ - bx + 2, where a and b are real numbers. The problem says that f(-3) = -1, and I need to find f(3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that f(x) is a cubic function because of the x³ term. It also has a linear term, -bx, and a constant term, +2. Since a and b are real numbers, they can take any value, but I need to figure out what f(3) is given that f(-3) = -1.Let me write down what I know:f(x) = a x³ - b x + 2f(-3) = -1So, if I plug x = -3 into f(x), I should get -1. Let me do that.f(-3) = a*(-3)³ - b*(-3) + 2 = -1Calculating each term step by step:First, (-3)³ is -27, so a*(-27) is -27a.Then, -b*(-3) is +3b.So, putting it all together:-27a + 3b + 2 = -1Now, let me write that equation:-27a + 3b + 2 = -1I can simplify this equation to find a relationship between a and b.Subtract 2 from both sides:-27a + 3b = -3Hmm, maybe I can factor out a common factor here. Let me see, both terms on the left have a factor of 3.So, factoring 3 out:3*(-9a + b) = -3Divide both sides by 3:-9a + b = -1So, that's one equation: -9a + b = -1.But I have two variables, a and b, so I need another equation to solve for both. However, the problem only gives me f(-3) = -1, which gives me this one equation. Hmm, maybe I don't need to find a and b individually? Maybe there's a way to find f(3) without knowing a and b separately.Let me think about f(3). If I plug x = 3 into f(x), I get:f(3) = a*(3)³ - b*(3) + 2Calculating each term:3³ is 27, so a*27 is 27a.Then, -b*3 is -3b.So, f(3) = 27a - 3b + 2Wait a second, that looks similar to the expression I got when I plugged in x = -3.From f(-3), I had:-27a + 3b + 2 = -1Which simplifies to:-27a + 3b = -3And f(3) is 27a - 3b + 2.Notice that 27a - 3b is just the negative of (-27a + 3b). So, if I let’s denote:Let me call the expression (-27a + 3b) as something, say, C.So, C = -27a + 3b = -3 (from the equation above)Then, 27a - 3b is just -C, which would be 3.Therefore, f(3) = (27a - 3b) + 2 = (-C) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.Wait, is that right? Let me verify.So, if C = -27a + 3b = -3, then 27a - 3b = 3, because multiplying both sides by -1 gives 27a - 3b = 3.Therefore, f(3) = 27a - 3b + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.Yes, that seems correct. So, f(3) is 5.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again.Given f(-3) = -1:f(-3) = a*(-3)^3 - b*(-3) + 2 = -1Calculates to:-27a + 3b + 2 = -1Subtract 2:-27a + 3b = -3Factor out 3:3*(-9a + b) = -3Divide by 3:-9a + b = -1So, that's one equation.Now, f(3) = a*(3)^3 - b*(3) + 2 = 27a - 3b + 2Notice that 27a - 3b is the negative of (-27a + 3b). Since we know that (-27a + 3b) = -3, then 27a - 3b = 3.Therefore, f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5.Yep, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can express f(3) in terms of f(-3). Let me see.Let me denote f(3) as:f(3) = 27a - 3b + 2And f(-3) = -27a + 3b + 2 = -1If I add f(3) and f(-3):f(3) + f(-3) = (27a - 3b + 2) + (-27a + 3b + 2) = 0 + 0 + 4 = 4So, f(3) + f(-3) = 4But f(-3) is given as -1, so:f(3) + (-1) = 4Therefore, f(3) = 4 + 1 = 5Oh, that's another way to see it. So, f(3) is 5.That confirms my earlier result.So, regardless of the values of a and b, as long as f(-3) = -1, f(3) must be 5.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(3) ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"There are 6 people standing in a row. How many different arrangements are there such that persons A and B are not next to each other?

Since there are 6 individuals, the total number of arrangements is 6 factorial, which is 720.Next, I'll calculate the number of arrangements where persons A and B are standing next to each other. To do this, I'll treat A and B as a single unit. This reduces the problem to arranging 5 units (the AB unit plus the other 4 people). The number of ways to arrange these 5 units is 5 factorial, which is 120. However, within the AB unit, A and B can switch places, so there are 2 possible arrangements for each unit. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where A and B are next to each other is 120 multiplied by 2, which equals 240.Finally, to find the number of arrangements where A and B are not next to each other, I'll subtract the number of restricted arrangements from the total number of arrangements.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, divisibility by 13. That means when ( 51^{2015} + a ) is divided by 13, there's no remainder. So, another way to put that is ( 51^{2015} + a equiv 0 mod 13 ). So, I need to find ( a ) such that this congruence holds.Alright, so maybe I can simplify ( 51^{2015} ) modulo 13 first. That might make things easier. Let me recall that if I can find a simpler equivalent of 51 modulo 13, then I can work with that instead, which might make exponentiation easier.So, 51 divided by 13. Let me compute that. 13 times 3 is 39, and 51 minus 39 is 12. So, 51 is congruent to 12 modulo 13. So, ( 51 equiv 12 mod 13 ). Alternatively, since 12 is congruent to -1 modulo 13, because 12 + 1 = 13, which is 0 modulo 13. So, ( 51 equiv -1 mod 13 ). That might be useful because working with -1 is often simpler when exponentiating.So, substituting that into the expression, ( 51^{2015} equiv (-1)^{2015} mod 13 ). Now, 2015 is an odd exponent, so ( (-1)^{2015} = -1 ). Therefore, ( 51^{2015} equiv -1 mod 13 ).So, now, going back to the original congruence: ( 51^{2015} + a equiv 0 mod 13 ). Substituting the value we just found, that becomes ( -1 + a equiv 0 mod 13 ). So, solving for ( a ), we get ( a equiv 1 mod 13 ).But wait, ( a ) is given to be between 0 and 13, inclusive. So, the smallest non-negative integer congruent to 1 modulo 13 is 1 itself. Therefore, ( a = 1 ).Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I started by recognizing that ( 51^{2015} + a ) must be divisible by 13, so ( 51^{2015} + a equiv 0 mod 13 ).2. I simplified 51 modulo 13. Since 13*3=39, 51-39=12, so 51≡12 mod13.3. Recognized that 12≡-1 mod13, which is correct because 12 +1=13≡0 mod13.4. Therefore, ( 51^{2015} ≡ (-1)^{2015} mod13 ). Since 2015 is odd, this is -1.5. Plugged back into the equation: -1 + a ≡0 mod13 ⇒ a≡1 mod13.6. Since a is between 0 and13, a=1.Seems solid. I don't see any errors here. Maybe I can verify it another way.Alternatively, I could compute ( 51^{2015} mod13 ) using Fermat's little theorem. Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, ( a^{p-1} ≡1 mod p ). Since 13 is prime, and 51 is not divisible by13 (since 51=3*17, neither of which is 13), so we can apply Fermat's little theorem.So, ( 51^{12} ≡1 mod13 ). Therefore, ( 51^{12k} ≡1^k=1 mod13 ) for any integer k.Now, let's express 2015 in terms of multiples of 12. Let's divide 2015 by12.12*167=2004, which is 12*167=2004. Then, 2015-2004=11. So, 2015=12*167 +11. Therefore, ( 51^{2015}=51^{12*167 +11}= (51^{12})^{167} *51^{11} ).By Fermat's little theorem, ( (51^{12})^{167} ≡1^{167}=1 mod13 ). So, ( 51^{2015} ≡1 *51^{11} mod13 ).So, now, I need to compute ( 51^{11} mod13 ). But since 51≡-1 mod13, as before, this becomes ( (-1)^{11} mod13 ). Since 11 is odd, that's -1. So, ( 51^{11} ≡-1 mod13 ). Therefore, ( 51^{2015} ≡1*(-1)= -1 mod13 ).So, again, ( 51^{2015} ≡-1 mod13 ). Therefore, ( -1 + a ≡0 mod13 ⇒ a≡1 mod13 ). So, same result.Therefore, I can be confident that ( a=1 ).Alternatively, another way to think about this is to compute 51 mod13, which is 12, and then compute 12^2015 mod13. Since 12≡-1 mod13, so 12^2015≡(-1)^2015≡-1 mod13. So, same result.Therefore, regardless of the method, the conclusion is that ( a=1 ).Just to make sure, let me compute 51 mod13 again. 13*3=39, 51-39=12. So, 51≡12≡-1 mod13. So, that's correct.And 2015 is an odd exponent, so (-1)^2015 is -1. So, 51^2015≡-1 mod13. Therefore, 51^2015 +a ≡-1 +a≡0 mod13. So, a≡1 mod13. Since a is between 0 and13, a=1.Yep, seems consistent.I think I've thought through this problem thoroughly, and all methods lead me to the conclusion that a=1.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given the inequality:[ left(frac{1}{m+n}right)^{2} leqslant kleft(frac{1}{m^{2}}+frac{1}{n^{2}}right) ]for all positive integers ( m ) and ( n ), find the minimum value of the real number ( k ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality:[left(frac{1}{m+n}right)^{2} leqslant kleft(frac{1}{m^{2}}+frac{1}{n^{2}}right)]And I need to find the minimum value of ( k ) such that this holds for all positive integers ( m ) and ( n ). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it a bit clearer:[frac{1}{(m+n)^2} leq k left( frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{n^2} right)]So, I need to find the smallest possible ( k ) such that this inequality is true no matter what positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) I choose. That means I should probably look for the maximum value of the left-hand side divided by the right-hand side, because ( k ) has to be at least as big as that maximum to satisfy the inequality for all ( m ) and ( n ).Let me denote:[frac{frac{1}{(m+n)^2}}{frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{n^2}} leq k]So, the maximum value of the left-hand side expression will be the minimal ( k ) that satisfies the inequality. Therefore, my task reduces to finding:[max_{m,n in mathbb{N}} frac{frac{1}{(m+n)^2}}{frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{n^2}}]Simplify this expression. Let me compute the denominator first:[frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{n^2} = frac{n^2 + m^2}{m^2 n^2}]So, the entire expression becomes:[frac{frac{1}{(m+n)^2}}{frac{n^2 + m^2}{m^2 n^2}} = frac{m^2 n^2}{(m+n)^2 (m^2 + n^2)}]So now, the problem is to find the maximum of:[frac{m^2 n^2}{(m+n)^2 (m^2 + n^2)}]over all positive integers ( m ) and ( n ).Hmm, okay. Maybe I can consider the case when ( m = n ). Let me try that. If ( m = n ), then:[frac{m^2 m^2}{(m + m)^2 (m^2 + m^2)} = frac{m^4}{(2m)^2 (2m^2)} = frac{m^4}{4m^2 cdot 2m^2} = frac{m^4}{8m^4} = frac{1}{8}]So, when ( m = n ), the expression equals ( frac{1}{8} ). Hmm, is this the maximum? Maybe, but I need to check other cases.What if ( m ) is much larger than ( n )? Let's say ( m ) approaches infinity while ( n ) is fixed. Let me see what happens.Let ( m ) be very large, and ( n ) is fixed, say ( n = 1 ). Then, the expression becomes:[frac{m^2 cdot 1^2}{(m + 1)^2 (m^2 + 1)} = frac{m^2}{(m + 1)^2 (m^2 + 1)}]As ( m ) becomes very large, the dominant terms are ( m^2 ) in the numerator and ( m^2 cdot m^2 = m^4 ) in the denominator. So, the expression behaves like ( frac{m^2}{m^4} = frac{1}{m^2} ), which tends to 0 as ( m ) approaches infinity. So, in this case, the expression tends to 0. So, not larger than ( frac{1}{8} ).Similarly, if ( n ) is much larger than ( m ), the expression also tends to 0. So, the maximum probably occurs somewhere in between.What if ( m ) and ( n ) are different but not too large? Let me try small integers.Case 1: ( m = 1, n = 1 ). Then, the expression is ( frac{1}{(1+1)^2 (1 + 1)} = frac{1}{4 cdot 2} = frac{1}{8} ). Same as before.Case 2: ( m = 1, n = 2 ). Then:[frac{1^2 cdot 2^2}{(1 + 2)^2 (1^2 + 2^2)} = frac{4}{9 cdot 5} = frac{4}{45} approx 0.0889]Which is less than ( frac{1}{8} ) (which is approximately 0.125).Case 3: ( m = 1, n = 3 ):[frac{1 cdot 9}{(4)^2 (1 + 9)} = frac{9}{16 cdot 10} = frac{9}{160} approx 0.05625]Even smaller.Case 4: ( m = 2, n = 2 ):We already did that, it's ( frac{1}{8} ).Case 5: ( m = 2, n = 3 ):[frac{4 cdot 9}{(5)^2 (4 + 9)} = frac{36}{25 cdot 13} = frac{36}{325} approx 0.1108]Which is still less than ( frac{1}{8} approx 0.125 ).Case 6: ( m = 2, n = 1 ):Same as ( m = 1, n = 2 ), which was approximately 0.0889.Case 7: ( m = 3, n = 1 ):Same as ( m = 1, n = 3 ), which was approximately 0.05625.Case 8: ( m = 3, n = 2 ):Same as ( m = 2, n = 3 ), approximately 0.1108.Case 9: ( m = 3, n = 3 ):[frac{9 cdot 9}{(6)^2 (9 + 9)} = frac{81}{36 cdot 18} = frac{81}{648} = frac{1}{8}]Again, ( frac{1}{8} ).Hmm, so so far, the maximum seems to be ( frac{1}{8} ). But let me check another case where ( m ) and ( n ) are different but not too large.Case 10: ( m = 2, n = 4 ):[frac{4 cdot 16}{(6)^2 (4 + 16)} = frac{64}{36 cdot 20} = frac{64}{720} = frac{8}{90} approx 0.0889]Still less than ( frac{1}{8} ).Case 11: ( m = 3, n = 4 ):[frac{9 cdot 16}{(7)^2 (9 + 16)} = frac{144}{49 cdot 25} = frac{144}{1225} approx 0.1176]Hmm, that's approximately 0.1176, which is still less than ( frac{1}{8} approx 0.125 ).Wait, maybe if I take ( m = 1, n = 2 ), but that was 0.0889. So, still not higher.Wait, let me think differently. Maybe instead of plugging in integers, I can consider ( m ) and ( n ) as real numbers and find the maximum, then argue that the maximum occurs at integers.Let me set ( m = n ). Then, as before, the expression is ( frac{1}{8} ). But if ( m ) and ( n ) are not equal, is it possible that the expression is higher?Wait, let me suppose ( m ) and ( n ) are real numbers greater than 0, and find the maximum of:[f(m, n) = frac{m^2 n^2}{(m + n)^2 (m^2 + n^2)}]Maybe using calculus.To find the maximum, I can use substitution. Let me set ( t = frac{m}{n} ), so ( t > 0 ). Then, ( m = tn ). Substitute into the function:[f(t, n) = frac{(t^2 n^2) n^2}{(tn + n)^2 (t^2 n^2 + n^2)} = frac{t^2 n^4}{(n(t + 1))^2 (n^2(t^2 + 1))} = frac{t^2 n^4}{n^2(t + 1)^2 cdot n^2(t^2 + 1)} = frac{t^2}{(t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1)}]So, the function simplifies to:[f(t) = frac{t^2}{(t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1)}]Now, we can consider ( t > 0 ) and find the maximum of ( f(t) ).Let me compute the derivative of ( f(t) ) with respect to ( t ) to find critical points.First, let me write ( f(t) ) as:[f(t) = frac{t^2}{(t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1)}]Let me denote ( u = t + 1 ) and ( v = t^2 + 1 ), but maybe it's better to compute the derivative directly.Let me set ( f(t) = frac{t^2}{(t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1)} ). Let me compute ( f'(t) ).Using the quotient rule:If ( f(t) = frac{N(t)}{D(t)} ), then ( f'(t) = frac{N'(t) D(t) - N(t) D'(t)}{D(t)^2} ).So, ( N(t) = t^2 ), ( D(t) = (t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1) ).First, compute ( N'(t) = 2t ).Now, compute ( D(t) = (t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1) ). Let me compute ( D'(t) ):Use the product rule: ( D'(t) = 2(t + 1)(1) cdot (t^2 + 1) + (t + 1)^2 cdot 2t ).Simplify:First term: ( 2(t + 1)(t^2 + 1) ).Second term: ( 2t(t + 1)^2 ).So,[D'(t) = 2(t + 1)(t^2 + 1) + 2t(t + 1)^2]Factor out ( 2(t + 1) ):[D'(t) = 2(t + 1)[(t^2 + 1) + t(t + 1)] = 2(t + 1)[t^2 + 1 + t^2 + t] = 2(t + 1)(2t^2 + t + 1)]So, putting it all together, the derivative ( f'(t) ) is:[f'(t) = frac{2t cdot (t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1) - t^2 cdot 2(t + 1)(2t^2 + t + 1)}{[(t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1)]^2}]Simplify numerator:Factor out ( 2t(t + 1) ):[2t(t + 1)[(t + 1)(t^2 + 1) - t(2t^2 + t + 1)]]Compute the expression inside the brackets:First term: ( (t + 1)(t^2 + 1) = t^3 + t^2 + t + 1 ).Second term: ( t(2t^2 + t + 1) = 2t^3 + t^2 + t ).Subtracting the second term from the first:[(t^3 + t^2 + t + 1) - (2t^3 + t^2 + t) = -t^3 + 0t^2 + 0t + 1 = -t^3 + 1]So, numerator becomes:[2t(t + 1)(-t^3 + 1) = 2t(t + 1)(1 - t^3)]Therefore, the derivative is:[f'(t) = frac{2t(t + 1)(1 - t^3)}{[(t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1)]^2} = frac{2t(1 - t^3)}{(t + 1)(t^2 + 1)^2}]Wait, let me check that. Wait, the denominator was squared, so:Denominator: ( [(t + 1)^2 (t^2 + 1)]^2 = (t + 1)^4 (t^2 + 1)^2 ).So, numerator is ( 2t(t + 1)(1 - t^3) ), so the derivative is:[f'(t) = frac{2t(t + 1)(1 - t^3)}{(t + 1)^4 (t^2 + 1)^2} = frac{2t(1 - t^3)}{(t + 1)^3 (t^2 + 1)^2}]Yes, that's correct.So, ( f'(t) = frac{2t(1 - t^3)}{(t + 1)^3 (t^2 + 1)^2} ).We can set ( f'(t) = 0 ) to find critical points.The numerator is ( 2t(1 - t^3) ). So, critical points occur when numerator is zero:Either ( 2t = 0 ) or ( 1 - t^3 = 0 ).But ( t > 0 ), so ( t = 0 ) is not in our domain. So, the critical point is at ( t^3 = 1 ), so ( t = 1 ).Additionally, we should check where the derivative is undefined, but since the denominator is always positive for ( t > 0 ), the only critical point is at ( t = 1 ).Now, let's analyze the behavior of ( f(t) ) around ( t = 1 ).When ( t < 1 ), say ( t = 0.5 ), then ( 1 - t^3 = 1 - 0.125 = 0.875 > 0 ). So, ( f'(t) > 0 ).When ( t > 1 ), say ( t = 2 ), then ( 1 - t^3 = 1 - 8 = -7 < 0 ). So, ( f'(t) < 0 ).Therefore, ( t = 1 ) is a point where the function changes from increasing to decreasing, so it's a maximum.Thus, the maximum of ( f(t) ) occurs at ( t = 1 ), which is ( f(1) = frac{1^2}{(1 + 1)^2 (1^2 + 1)} = frac{1}{4 cdot 2} = frac{1}{8} ).Therefore, the maximum value of the expression is ( frac{1}{8} ), which occurs when ( t = 1 ), i.e., when ( m = n ).So, going back to the original problem, this means that the minimal ( k ) is ( frac{1}{8} ), because for all positive integers ( m ) and ( n ), the expression ( frac{1}{(m + n)^2} ) divided by ( frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{n^2} ) is at most ( frac{1}{8} ), and this maximum is achieved when ( m = n ).Therefore, the minimal ( k ) is ( frac{1}{8} ).**Final Answer**The minimum value of ( k ) is boxed{dfrac{1}{8}}."},{"question":"Calculate: sqrt{(-2)^{2}}+(sqrt{2})^{2}=____.","answer":"First, I need to calculate the square root of ((-2)) squared.
