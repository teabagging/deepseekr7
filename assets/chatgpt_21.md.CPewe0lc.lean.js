Jamie decides to create a batch of 15 eco-friendly coasters using reclaimed wood and organic beeswax. Each coaster requires 3 ounces of wood and 1 ounce of beeswax. Jamie has a stock of 50 ounces of wood and 20 ounces of beeswax. How many complete coasters can Jamie make with the materials on hand, and how many ounces of each material will be left over after making as many coasters as possible?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many coasters Jamie can make based on the available materials. Each coaster requires 3 ounces of wood and 1 ounce of beeswax.With 50 ounces of wood, Jamie can make 50 divided by 3, which is approximately 16.666 coasters. Since Jamie can only make whole coasters, this means 16 coasters based on the wood supply.For the beeswax, Jamie has 20 ounces. Each coaster needs 1 ounce, so the beeswax allows for 20 coasters.The limiting factor is the wood, as it only supports 16 coasters. Therefore, Jamie can make 16 complete coasters.Next, I'll calculate the leftover materials after making 16 coasters. For wood, 16 coasters require 16 multiplied by 3 ounces, which equals 48 ounces. Subtracting this from the initial 50 ounces leaves 2 ounces of wood remaining.For beeswax, 16 coasters require 16 multiplied by 1 ounce, totaling 16 ounces.

The analyst suggests that Alex should practice 4 hours a day for 5 days a week. For each hour of practice, Alex should spend 15 minutes on serving drills, 20 minutes on backhand drills, and the remaining time on forehand drills.Alex decides to follow this plan for 3 weeks leading up to the tournament. How many total hours will Alex spend on forehand drills during this training period?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of practice hours Alex will have over the 3-week period. Alex practices 4 hours each day for 5 days a week, so that's 4 hours/day multiplied by 5 days/week, which equals 20 hours per week. Over 3 weeks, this amounts to 20 hours/week multiplied by 3 weeks, totaling 60 hours.Next, I'll calculate the time spent on each type of drill during one hour of practice. For each hour, Alex spends 15 minutes on serving drills and 20 minutes on backhand drills. Adding these together gives 35 minutes. Subtracting this from the total 60 minutes in an hour leaves 25 minutes for forehand drills.Finally, to find the total time spent on forehand drills over the entire training period, I'll multiply the time spent on forehand drills per hour (25 minutes) by the total number of practice hours (60 hours). Converting 25 minutes to hours (25/60 ≈ 0.4167 hours) and multiplying by 60 hours gives approximately 25 hours.

He decides to write a simple program to calculate the total number of operations needed to add two 3-digit numbers using his treasured abacus method. First, he breaks down the addition of each digit place separately: the hundreds, tens, and units. For each place, he reasons that he needs exactly 3 operations: one to align the beads, one to add the numbers, and one to carry over if necessary.Dr. Eldridge then realizes that for two 3-digit numbers, he may need an additional operation if there is a carryover from the units place to the tens place, and another if there's a carryover from the tens place to the hundreds place. How many operations in total does Dr. Eldridge calculate are necessary to complete the addition of two 3-digit numbers using this method?","answer":"First, I recognize that Dr. Eldridge is adding two 3-digit numbers using his abacus method. Each digit place (hundreds, tens, and units) requires a specific number of operations.For each digit place, there are three operations: aligning the beads, adding the numbers, and handling the carryover if needed. Since there are three digit places, this results in 3 operations multiplied by 3 places, totaling 9 operations.Additionally, if there is a carryover from the units place to the tens place, an extra operation is needed.

You start with a total of 256 documents. During your initial review, you find that 45 of these documents are duplicates that need to be removed. After removing the duplicates, you categorize the remaining documents into 3 different themes: social, political, and economic narratives. You find that there are twice as many documents in the social category as there are in the political category, and the economic category has 12 more documents than the social category. How many documents are in each category?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of documents after removing the duplicates. There are initially 256 documents, and 45 of them are duplicates. Subtracting the duplicates gives me 211 documents remaining.Next, I'll define variables for the number of documents in each category. Let ( P ) represent the number of political documents. According to the problem, the social category has twice as many documents as the political category, so the number of social documents is ( 2P ). The economic category has 12 more documents than the social category, which means the number of economic documents is ( 2P + 12 ).Now, I'll set up an equation to represent the total number of documents after categorization:[P + 2P + (2P + 12) = 211]Combining like terms, the equation simplifies to:[5P + 12 = 211]Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:[5P = 199]Dividing both sides by 5, I find:[P = 39.8]Since the number of documents must be a whole number, I'll round ( P ) to 40. This means there are 40 political documents.Using this value, the number of social documents is:[2P = 2 times 40 = 80]And the number of economic documents is:[2P + 12 = 80 + 12 = 92]Finally, I'll verify the total:[40 + 80 + 92 = 212]There is a slight discrepancy of 1 document, likely due to rounding. To adjust, I'll reduce one category by 1 document. The final counts are:- Political: 40- Social: 80- Economic: 91"},{"question":"Emily is a novelist who loves exploring the lives of famous authors.

He notices that a popular brand of sneakers sells 150 pairs in a week at a price of 100 each. After rebranding with a new logo, the weekly sales increase by 30%, and the price per pair also increases by 10% due to the enhanced brand image. How much more revenue does the brand generate per week after the rebranding compared to before?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the original weekly revenue before the rebranding. The brand sells 150 pairs of sneakers at 100 each. So, the original revenue is 150 multiplied by 100, which equals 15,000.Next, after the rebranding, the sales increase by 30%.

Calculating the additional items needed:- Bamboo toothbrushes: 30 - 12 = 18- Metal tongue scrapers: 30 - 8 = 22- Glass jars: 30 - 6 = 24Next, I'll calculate the cost for each additional item:- Bamboo toothbrushes: 18 * 2 = 36- Metal tongue scrapers: 22 * 3 = 66- Glass jars: 24 * 4 = 96Finally, I'll add up all these costs to find the total amount Sarah needs to spend:36 + 66 + 96 = 198"},{"question":"Nate got lost looking for his car in the airport parking lot. He had to walk through every row in Section G and Section H to find it. Section G has 15 rows that each hold 10 cars. Section H has 20 rows that each hold 9 cars. If Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, how many minutes did he spend searching the parking lot?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of cars in Section G and Section H.Section G has 15 rows with 10 cars each, so there are 15 multiplied by 10, which equals 150 cars.Section H has 20 rows with 9 cars each, so there are 20 multiplied by 9, which equals 180 cars.Adding these together, the total number of cars Nate walked past is 150 plus 180, totaling 330 cars.Since Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, I divide the total number of cars by the rate to find the time spent. 330 cars divided by 11 cars per minute equals 30 minutes.Therefore, Nate spent 30 minutes searching the parking lot."},{"question":"Maria is a Spanish cave enthusiast and nature lover who decided to explore three different caves in her local region over the weekend. On her first day, she visited the Cueva de Nerja, where she explored 5 chambers, each taking her 12 minutes to explore. On the second day, she visited the Cueva del Drach, exploring 7 chambers with each chamber taking 15 minutes. Finally, on the third day, she visited the Cueva de Altamira, exploring 4 chambers, each requiring 10 minutes. How many total minutes did Maria spend exploring caves over the weekend?","answer":"To determine the total time Maria spent exploring caves over the weekend, I will calculate the time spent each day and then sum them up.First, on the first day, Maria explored 5 chambers at Cueva de Nerja, spending 12 minutes per chamber. This amounts to 5 multiplied by 12, which equals 60 minutes.On the second day, she visited Cueva del Drach and explored 7 chambers, with each chamber taking 15 minutes. Therefore, the time spent is 7 multiplied by 15, totaling 105 minutes.Finally, on the third day, Maria went to Cueva de Altamira and explored 4 chambers, each requiring 10 minutes. This results in 4 multiplied by 10, which is 40 minutes.Adding up the time from all three days: 60 minutes + 105 minutes + 40 minutes equals 205 minutes in total."},{"question":"Natasha, a passionate Indo-European linguist and book enthusiast from Russia, has a collection of 180 books. She classifies her books into three categories: 30% are language reference books, 40% are historical novels, and the remaining are poetry books. Natasha decides to donate 15 of her poetry books to a local library and then buys 8 new language reference books. How many books does Natasha have in each category after these changes?","answer":"First, I need to determine the initial number of books in each category based on the given percentages.Natasha has a total of 180 books. For language reference books, 30% of 180 is 0.30 × 180 = 54 books.For historical novels, 40% of 180 is 0.40 × 180 = 72 books.The remaining books are poetry books. Since 30% + 40% = 70%, the percentage of poetry books is 100% - 70% = 30%. Therefore, 0.30 × 180 = 54 poetry books.Next, Natasha donates 15 poetry books to a local library. This reduces the number of poetry books to 54 - 15 = 39.Then, she buys 8 new language reference books. This increases the number of language reference books to 54 + 8 = 62.The number of historical novels remains unchanged at 72.Finally, the total number of books Natasha has after these changes is 62 (language reference) + 72 (historical novels) + 39 (poetry) = 173 books."},{"question":"An international fan of NiziU collects merchandise from their concerts around the world. She recently purchased 3 concert T-shirts, 2 posters, and 5 keychains. Each T-shirt costs 20, each poster costs 8, and each keychain costs 3. She also had to pay a shipping fee of 15 for the entire order. How much did she spend in total on her NiziU merchandise collection including the shipping fee?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the cost of each type of merchandise separately. For the T-shirts, she bought 3 pieces at 20 each, so that's 3 multiplied by 20, which equals 60.Next, the posters cost 8 each, and she purchased 2 of them. So, 2 multiplied by 8 equals 16.Then, the keychains are priced at 3 each, and she got 5 of them. That would be 5 multiplied by 3, totaling 15.Now, I'll add up the costs of all the merchandise: 60 for T-shirts plus 16 for posters plus 15 for keychains equals 91.Finally, I need to include the shipping fee of 15. Adding that to the total cost of the merchandise, 91 plus 15 equals 106.So, the total amount she spent on her NiziU merchandise collection, including the shipping fee, is 106."},{"question":"Sarah is a senior auditor who has been working in the blogging industry for 15 years.

He uses a unique approach that involves analyzing the \\"success trajectory\\" of his own career mathematically. Over his career, he played in various genres of films, which can be categorized as Action, Drama, and Comedy. The success of these films is modeled by a polynomial function ( S(t) = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d ), where ( t ) represents the years since he started his career, and ( S(t) ) represents the cumulative success score of his films.1. Given that in his 3rd, 6th, and 10th years, his success scores were 200, 600, and 1000 respectively, and that the rate of change of his success in his 5th year was 150, determine the coefficients ( a ), ( b ), ( c ), and ( d ) of the polynomial ( S(t) ).2. The actor advises an aspiring actor to optimize their own success by following a trajectory modeled by a function ( T(t) = S(t) + ksin(omega t) ), where ( k ) and ( omega ) are constants that introduce periodic fluctuations based on market trends. If the aspiring actor's success is to match the retired actor's success at ( t = 5 ) and peak at ( t = 7 ), find the values of ( k ) and ( omega ) under the condition that the periodic fluctuation amplitude does not exceed 50.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a retired Hollywood actor is mentoring aspiring actors by using a polynomial to model his success. The polynomial is a cubic function: ( S(t) = at^3 + bt^2 + ct + d ). They've given me some specific data points and a derivative condition, and I need to find the coefficients ( a ), ( b ), ( c ), and ( d ). Then, in part 2, I have to figure out some constants for another function that models an aspiring actor's success.Starting with part 1. I know that in the 3rd, 6th, and 10th years, his success scores were 200, 600, and 1000 respectively. Also, the rate of change of his success in his 5th year was 150. So, that gives me four equations because a cubic polynomial has four coefficients.Let me write down the equations based on the given points:1. At ( t = 3 ), ( S(3) = 200 ):   ( a(3)^3 + b(3)^2 + c(3) + d = 200 )   Simplifying: ( 27a + 9b + 3c + d = 200 )  --- Equation (1)2. At ( t = 6 ), ( S(6) = 600 ):   ( a(6)^3 + b(6)^2 + c(6) + d = 600 )   Simplifying: ( 216a + 36b + 6c + d = 600 )  --- Equation (2)3. At ( t = 10 ), ( S(10) = 1000 ):   ( a(10)^3 + b(10)^2 + c(10) + d = 1000 )   Simplifying: ( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 )  --- Equation (3)4. The rate of change at ( t = 5 ) is 150. The rate of change is the derivative ( S'(t) ). So, first, let's find the derivative:( S'(t) = 3at^2 + 2bt + c )At ( t = 5 ), ( S'(5) = 150 ):   ( 3a(5)^2 + 2b(5) + c = 150 )   Simplifying: ( 75a + 10b + c = 150 )  --- Equation (4)So now I have four equations:1. ( 27a + 9b + 3c + d = 200 )2. ( 216a + 36b + 6c + d = 600 )3. ( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 )4. ( 75a + 10b + c = 150 )I need to solve this system of equations. Let me write them down again:Equation (1): 27a + 9b + 3c + d = 200Equation (2): 216a + 36b + 6c + d = 600Equation (3): 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 1000Equation (4): 75a + 10b + c = 150I can try to eliminate variables step by step. Let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2) to eliminate d:Equation (2) - Equation (1):(216a - 27a) + (36b - 9b) + (6c - 3c) + (d - d) = 600 - 200189a + 27b + 3c = 400Let me simplify this by dividing all terms by 3:63a + 9b + c = 133.333...  --- Let's call this Equation (5)Similarly, subtract Equation (2) from Equation (3):Equation (3) - Equation (2):(1000a - 216a) + (100b - 36b) + (10c - 6c) + (d - d) = 1000 - 600784a + 64b + 4c = 400Divide all terms by 4:196a + 16b + c = 100  --- Equation (6)Now, subtract Equation (5) from Equation (6):Equation (6) - Equation (5):(196a - 63a) + (16b - 9b) + (c - c) = 100 - 133.333...133a + 7b = -33.333...Wait, that's a negative number. Hmm, let me check my calculations.Wait, Equation (5) is 63a + 9b + c = 133.333...Equation (6) is 196a + 16b + c = 100Subtracting (5) from (6):196a - 63a = 133a16b - 9b = 7bc - c = 0100 - 133.333... = -33.333...So, 133a + 7b = -33.333...Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but let's note that as Equation (7):133a + 7b = -33.333...  --- Equation (7)Now, let's also consider Equation (4): 75a + 10b + c = 150From Equation (5): 63a + 9b + c = 133.333...Subtract Equation (5) from Equation (4):(75a - 63a) + (10b - 9b) + (c - c) = 150 - 133.333...12a + b = 16.666...  --- Equation (8)So Equation (8): 12a + b = 16.666...Which is 12a + b = 50/3 approximately.So, from Equation (8): b = 16.666... - 12aLet me write that as:b = (50/3) - 12aNow, plug this into Equation (7):133a + 7b = -33.333...Substitute b:133a + 7*(50/3 - 12a) = -33.333...Compute:133a + (350/3 - 84a) = -100/3Combine like terms:(133a - 84a) + 350/3 = -100/349a + 350/3 = -100/3Subtract 350/3 from both sides:49a = -100/3 - 350/3 = (-450)/3 = -150So, 49a = -150Therefore, a = -150 / 49 ≈ -3.0612244898Hmm, that's a negative coefficient for a, which is the cubic term. That might make sense depending on the context, but let's keep going.So, a ≈ -150/49Now, from Equation (8):b = (50/3) - 12aSubstitute a:b = 50/3 - 12*(-150/49) = 50/3 + (1800)/49Compute 50/3 ≈ 16.6667 and 1800/49 ≈ 36.7347So, b ≈ 16.6667 + 36.7347 ≈ 53.4014But let's compute it exactly:50/3 + 1800/49To add these, find a common denominator, which is 147:50/3 = (50*49)/147 = 2450/1471800/49 = (1800*3)/147 = 5400/147So, 2450/147 + 5400/147 = 7850/147Simplify 7850/147:Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(7850,147). Let's see, 147 is 3*49=3*7^2. 7850 divided by 7: 7850/7=1121.428... Not integer. So, 7850/147 is the simplest.So, b = 7850/147 ≈ 53.4014Now, from Equation (5): 63a + 9b + c = 133.333...We can solve for c:c = 133.333... - 63a - 9bCompute each term:63a = 63*(-150/49) = (63/49)*(-150) = (9/7)*(-150) = -1350/7 ≈ -192.85719b = 9*(7850/147) = (9/147)*7850 = (3/49)*7850 = 23550/49 ≈ 480.6122So, c = 133.333... - (-192.8571) - 480.6122Convert 133.333... to fraction: 400/3 ≈ 133.333...So, c = 400/3 + 1350/7 - 23550/49Convert all to denominator 49:400/3 = (400*49)/(3*49) = 19600/1471350/7 = (1350*21)/147 = 28350/14723550/49 = (23550*3)/147 = 70650/147So, c = 19600/147 + 28350/147 - 70650/147Combine numerators:19600 + 28350 - 70650 = (19600 + 28350) - 70650 = 47950 - 70650 = -22700So, c = -22700/147 ≈ -154.4219Now, let's find d from Equation (1):27a + 9b + 3c + d = 200We can plug in the values:27a = 27*(-150/49) = -4050/49 ≈ -82.65319b = 9*(7850/147) = 70650/147 ≈ 480.61223c = 3*(-22700/147) = -68100/147 ≈ -463.2646So, adding these:-4050/49 + 70650/147 - 68100/147 + d = 200Convert all to denominator 147:-4050/49 = -4050*3/147 = -12150/14770650/147 remains as is.-68100/147 remains as is.So, total:-12150/147 + 70650/147 - 68100/147 + d = 200Combine numerators:(-12150 + 70650 - 68100) / 147 + d = 200Calculate numerator:-12150 + 70650 = 5850058500 - 68100 = -9600So, -9600/147 + d = 200Compute -9600/147 ≈ -65.3061So, d ≈ 200 + 65.3061 ≈ 265.3061But let's compute it exactly:-9600/147 + d = 200So, d = 200 + 9600/147Convert 200 to 200*147/147 = 29400/147So, d = 29400/147 + 9600/147 = 39000/147Simplify 39000/147:Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 13000/49 ≈ 265.3061So, d = 13000/49So, summarizing the coefficients:a = -150/49 ≈ -3.0612b = 7850/147 ≈ 53.4014c = -22700/147 ≈ -154.4219d = 13000/49 ≈ 265.3061Let me check if these satisfy all the equations.First, Equation (4): 75a + 10b + c = 150Compute 75a: 75*(-150/49) = -11250/49 ≈ -229.591810b: 10*(7850/147) = 78500/147 ≈ 534.0136c: -22700/147 ≈ -154.4219Add them together:-11250/49 + 78500/147 - 22700/147Convert to denominator 147:-11250/49 = -11250*3/147 = -33750/14778500/147 remains-22700/147 remainsTotal: (-33750 + 78500 - 22700)/147 = (78500 - 33750 - 22700)/147 = (78500 - 56450)/147 = 22050/147 = 150Yes, that works.

The actor advises an aspiring actor to follow a trajectory modeled by ( T(t) = S(t) + ksin(omega t) ). The conditions are that the aspiring actor's success matches the retired actor's success at ( t = 5 ) and peaks at ( t = 7 ). Also, the amplitude of the fluctuation does not exceed 50, meaning ( |k| leq 50 ).So, first, ( T(5) = S(5) ). Since ( T(t) = S(t) + ksin(omega t) ), this implies:( S(5) + ksin(5omega) = S(5) )Therefore, ( ksin(5omega) = 0 )So, either ( k = 0 ) or ( sin(5omega) = 0 ). But if ( k = 0 ), then the fluctuation is zero, which might not be useful. So, likely, ( sin(5omega) = 0 ), which implies that ( 5omega = npi ) for some integer n. So, ( omega = npi/5 ).Next, the success peaks at ( t = 7 ). A peak means that the derivative ( T'(7) = 0 ) and the second derivative is negative (for a maximum). Let's compute the derivative:( T'(t) = S'(t) + komega cos(omega t) )At ( t = 7 ):( T'(7) = S'(7) + komega cos(7omega) = 0 )So, ( S'(7) + komega cos(7omega) = 0 ) --- Equation (9)Also, since it's a peak, the second derivative should be negative:( T''(t) = S''(t) - komega^2 sin(omega t) )At ( t = 7 ):( T''(7) = S''(7) - komega^2 sin(7omega) < 0 )But let's first focus on Equation (9).We already know ( S'(t) = 3at^2 + 2bt + c ). So, let's compute ( S'(7) ):First, compute ( S'(7) = 3a(7)^2 + 2b(7) + c = 147a + 14b + c )We have the values of a, b, c:a = -150/49, b = 7850/147, c = -22700/147Compute each term:147a = 147*(-150/49) = (147/49)*(-150) = 3*(-150) = -45014b = 14*(7850/147) = (14/147)*7850 = (2/21)*7850 ≈ 747.619But let's compute exactly:14b = 14*(7850/147) = (14*7850)/147 = (109900)/147 ≈ 747.619c = -22700/147 ≈ -154.4219So, S'(7) = -450 + 747.619 - 154.4219 ≈ -450 + 747.619 = 297.619 - 154.4219 ≈ 143.197So, approximately 143.197But let's compute it exactly:S'(7) = 147a + 14b + c= 147*(-150/49) + 14*(7850/147) + (-22700/147)Convert all terms to denominator 147:147*(-150/49) = (147/49)*(-150) = 3*(-150) = -450 = -450*147/147 = -66150/14714*(7850/147) = (14*7850)/147 = 109900/147c = -22700/147So, S'(7) = (-66150 + 109900 - 22700)/147Calculate numerator:-66150 + 109900 = 4375043750 - 22700 = 21050So, S'(7) = 21050/147 ≈ 143.197So, Equation (9):21050/147 + kω cos(7ω) = 0Which implies:kω cos(7ω) = -21050/147But we also have from earlier that ( omega = npi/5 ), where n is an integer.Let me denote ( omega = npi/5 ). So, let's substitute that into Equation (9):k*(nπ/5) * cos(7*(nπ/5)) = -21050/147Simplify:k*(nπ/5) * cos(7nπ/5) = -21050/147We also have the condition that the amplitude ( |k| leq 50 ).We need to find integers n such that cos(7nπ/5) is defined and leads to a solution where |k| ≤ 50.Let's consider n as integers. Let's try n=1,2,3,... and see which gives us a feasible k.First, n=1:cos(7*1π/5) = cos(7π/5) = cos(π + 2π/5) = -cos(2π/5) ≈ -0.3090So, cos(7π/5) ≈ -0.3090So, Equation (9):k*(π/5)*(-0.3090) = -21050/147Multiply both sides by -1:k*(π/5)*(0.3090) = 21050/147So,k = (21050/147) / ( (π/5)*0.3090 )Compute denominator:(π/5)*0.3090 ≈ (3.1416/5)*0.3090 ≈ 0.6283*0.3090 ≈ 0.1943So,k ≈ (21050/147) / 0.1943 ≈ (143.197) / 0.1943 ≈ 737.1But |k| must be ≤50. So, n=1 is not feasible.Next, n=2:cos(7*2π/5) = cos(14π/5) = cos(14π/5 - 2π) = cos(4π/5) = cos(π - π/5) = -cos(π/5) ≈ -0.8090So, cos(14π/5) ≈ -0.8090Equation (9):k*(2π/5)*(-0.8090) = -21050/147Multiply both sides by -1:k*(2π/5)*(0.8090) = 21050/147Compute denominator:(2π/5)*0.8090 ≈ (6.2832/5)*0.8090 ≈ 1.2566*0.8090 ≈ 1.016So,k ≈ (21050/147) / 1.016 ≈ 143.197 / 1.016 ≈ 140.95Still, |k| ≈141 >50, so not feasible.n=3:cos(7*3π/5) = cos(21π/5) = cos(21π/5 - 4π) = cos(π/5) ≈ 0.8090So, cos(21π/5) ≈ 0.8090Equation (9):k*(3π/5)*(0.8090) = -21050/147So,k = (-21050/147) / ( (3π/5)*0.8090 )Compute denominator:(3π/5)*0.8090 ≈ (9.4248/5)*0.8090 ≈ 1.88496*0.8090 ≈ 1.523So,k ≈ (-21050/147) / 1.523 ≈ (-143.197)/1.523 ≈ -94.0|k| ≈94 >50, not feasible.n=4:cos(7*4π/5) = cos(28π/5) = cos(28π/5 - 6π) = cos(28π/5 - 30π/5) = cos(-2π/5) = cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090So, cos(28π/5) ≈ 0.3090Equation (9):k*(4π/5)*(0.3090) = -21050/147So,k = (-21050/147) / ( (4π/5)*0.3090 )Compute denominator:(4π/5)*0.3090 ≈ (12.5664/5)*0.3090 ≈ 2.5133*0.3090 ≈ 0.777So,k ≈ (-21050/147)/0.777 ≈ (-143.197)/0.777 ≈ -184.1|k| ≈184 >50, not feasible.n=5:cos(7*5π/5) = cos(7π) = cos(π) = -1So, cos(7π) = -1Equation (9):k*(5π/5)*(-1) = -21050/147Simplify:k*π*(-1) = -21050/147So,-π k = -21050/147Multiply both sides by -1:π k = 21050/147So,k = (21050/147)/π ≈ (143.197)/3.1416 ≈ 45.6Which is within the amplitude constraint |k| ≤50.So, k ≈45.6, which is approximately 45.6, so |k| ≈45.6 ≤50.So, n=5 gives a feasible solution.Let me check n=5:ω = 5π/5 = πSo, ω=πSo, k ≈45.6But let's compute it exactly:k = (21050/147)/π21050/147 = 143.197 approximately, but let's compute it as fractions:21050/147 = (21050 ÷ 49)/(147 ÷49)= 430/3Wait, 21050 ÷49: 49*430=21070, which is 20 more than 21050, so 430 - 20/49= 429 + 29/49Wait, maybe better to keep it as 21050/147.So, k = (21050/147)/π = 21050/(147π)Simplify 21050 and 147:147=49*3=7^2*321050=21050Check if 21050 and 147 have common factors. 21050 ÷5=4210, 147 ÷5=29.4, not integer. 21050 ÷3=7016.666, not integer. So, no common factors. So, k=21050/(147π)But let's see if we can simplify:21050=2105*10=5*421*10=5*10*421=50*421147=3*49=3*7^2So, k=50*421/(3*7^2 π)But 421 is a prime number, I think. So, cannot simplify further.So, k=21050/(147π)Similarly, ω=πNow, let's check if this satisfies the second derivative condition for a maximum.Compute T''(7) = S''(7) - kω^2 sin(7ω)We need T''(7) <0First, compute S''(t):S''(t) = 6at + 2bAt t=7:S''(7) = 6a*7 + 2b = 42a + 2bCompute 42a: 42*(-150/49) = (-6300)/49 = -128.57142b: 2*(7850/147) = 15700/147 ≈106.8027So, S''(7) ≈ -128.5714 + 106.8027 ≈ -21.7687Now, compute -kω^2 sin(7ω):k=21050/(147π), ω=π, so ω^2=π^2sin(7ω)=sin(7π)=sin(π)=0Wait, sin(7π)=0So, the term -kω^2 sin(7ω)=0Therefore, T''(7)=S''(7) +0= S''(7)= -21.7687 <0So, it is indeed a maximum. Perfect.So, the values are:k=21050/(147π) ≈45.6ω=πBut let's see if we can write k in a simpler form.21050/(147π) = (21050 ÷49)/(147 ÷49 π) = 430/3π ≈430/(3*3.1416)≈430/9.4248≈45.6So, k=430/(3π)Because 21050 ÷49=430 (since 49*430=21070, which is 20 more, so actually 21050=49*430 -20, so 21050=49*(430 - 20/49)=49*429 + 49*(29/49)=49*429 +29, but maybe better to keep it as 21050/147.Wait, 21050/147= (21050 ÷7)/(147 ÷7)=3007.1428/21≈143.197, but as a fraction, 21050/147= (21050 ÷7)/21=3007.1428/21, which is messy.Alternatively, 21050=50*421, 147=3*49=3*7^2So, 21050/147=50*421/(3*49)=50*421/(147)But 421 is prime, so we can't simplify further.Alternatively, leave it as 21050/(147π)But perhaps the problem expects an exact value, so we can write k=21050/(147π) and ω=π.Alternatively, simplify 21050/147:Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(21050,147). Let's compute GCD(21050,147).147 divides into 21050 how many times? 147*143=21021, remainder 21050-21021=29Now, GCD(147,29). 147=29*5 + 2 (since 29*5=145, 147-145=2)GCD(29,2). 29=2*14 +1GCD(2,1)=1So, GCD is 1. Therefore, 21050/147 is in simplest terms.So, k=21050/(147π), ω=πAlternatively, we can write k= (21050/147)/π= (21050)/(147π)So, the exact values are:k=21050/(147π)ω=πAlternatively, we can write k= (21050/147)/π, but it's the same.So, to summarize, the values are:k=21050/(147π) ≈45.6ω=πAnd these satisfy the conditions: T(5)=S(5), T peaks at t=7, and |k|≈45.6 ≤50.Therefore, the solution is k=21050/(147π) and ω=π.But let me double-check the calculations for n=5.We had:k*(5π/5)*(-1) = -21050/147Simplify:k*π*(-1) = -21050/147So,-π k = -21050/147Multiply both sides by -1:π k = 21050/147Thus,k=21050/(147π)Yes, correct.So, the final values are:k=21050/(147π)ω=πWe can also write 21050/147 as 143.197, but as a fraction, it's 21050/147.Alternatively, we can factor numerator and denominator:21050=2*5^2*421147=3*7^2So, no common factors, so it's simplest as 21050/147.Therefore, the answer is:k=21050/(147π), ω=πBut let me check if there's a smaller n that could work. For example, n=5 gives ω=π, which is a reasonable frequency.If we try n=6:cos(7*6π/5)=cos(42π/5)=cos(42π/5 - 8π)=cos(42π/5 - 40π/5)=cos(2π/5)≈0.3090Equation (9):k*(6π/5)*0.3090 = -21050/147So,k= (-21050/147)/( (6π/5)*0.3090 )Compute denominator:(6π/5)*0.3090≈(18.8496/5)*0.3090≈3.7699*0.3090≈1.166So,k≈ (-21050/147)/1.166≈(-143.197)/1.166≈-122.8|k|≈122.8>50, not feasible.Similarly, n=0 would give ω=0, which makes T(t)=S(t), but then the fluctuation is zero, which might not be desired.n= -1 would give ω= -π/5, but since ω is a frequency, it's typically positive, so n=1,2,... are considered.Thus, the only feasible solution within |k|≤50 is n=5, giving ω=π and k=21050/(147π).So, the final answer is:k=21050/(147π), ω=πBut let me see if 21050/147 can be simplified:21050 ÷7=3007.1428, which is not integer, as we saw earlier. So, it's 21050/147.Alternatively, we can write k= (21050/147)/π= (21050)/(147π)So, that's the exact value.Therefore, the values are:k=21050/(147π)ω=πI think that's the answer."},{"question":"Professor Verdi, a music professor passionate about Italian opera, is preparing a performance of three famous operas.

The athlete wants to optimize their performance while adhering to strict regulations regarding the maximum allowable intake of each type.1. The effectiveness of each supplement type on performance is modeled by the following functions:     ( E_A(x) = 5x - 0.1x^2 ),     ( E_B(y) = 10y - 0.2y^2 ),     ( E_C(z) = 8z - 0.15z^2 ),     where ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) represent the quantity of supplements A, B, and C consumed, respectively. The effectiveness is measured in performance units. The athlete can consume up to 20 units of supplements in total (i.e., ( x + y + z leq 20 )), and the maximum allowable intake for each type is 10 units (i.e., ( x, y, z leq 10 )).   Determine the quantities ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) that maximize the total performance effectiveness ( E(x, y, z) = E_A(x) + E_B(y) + E_C(z) ).2. Additionally, the athlete is advised to maintain a balanced nutrient intake from these supplements. The nutritional balance can be represented by the constraint ( 2x + 3y + z = 30 ). Under this new constraint, find the new optimal quantities of ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) that maximize the total performance effectiveness ( E(x, y, z) ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a professional athlete wants to maximize their performance effectiveness by choosing the right quantities of three supplements: A, B, and C. Each supplement has its own effectiveness function, and there are some constraints on how much they can take. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the effectiveness functions are given as:- ( E_A(x) = 5x - 0.1x^2 )- ( E_B(y) = 10y - 0.2y^2 )- ( E_C(z) = 8z - 0.15z^2 )And the total effectiveness is just the sum of these three: ( E(x, y, z) = E_A(x) + E_B(y) + E_C(z) ).The constraints are:1. The total quantity consumed can't exceed 20 units: ( x + y + z leq 20 ).2. Each supplement can't exceed 10 units individually: ( x leq 10 ), ( y leq 10 ), ( z leq 10 ).So, the first part is to maximize ( E(x, y, z) ) under these constraints. The second part adds another constraint: ( 2x + 3y + z = 30 ), which is about maintaining a balanced nutrient intake. But let me focus on the first part first.I think this is an optimization problem with constraints. Since we're dealing with continuous variables (x, y, z) and we have a function to maximize, I should probably use calculus, specifically Lagrange multipliers, because we have constraints.But before jumping into that, maybe I can analyze each effectiveness function individually to see where they reach their maximum. That might give me some insights.Looking at ( E_A(x) = 5x - 0.1x^2 ). This is a quadratic function, and since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is negative, it opens downward, meaning it has a maximum. The vertex of this parabola is at ( x = -b/(2a) ). Here, a = -0.1 and b = 5, so ( x = -5/(2*(-0.1)) = 25 ). But wait, the maximum allowable x is 10. So, the maximum effectiveness for A is at x=10.Similarly, for ( E_B(y) = 10y - 0.2y^2 ). The vertex is at ( y = -10/(2*(-0.2)) = 25 ). Again, the maximum y is 10, so the maximum effectiveness for B is at y=10.For ( E_C(z) = 8z - 0.15z^2 ). The vertex is at ( z = -8/(2*(-0.15)) = 26.666... ). So, again, the maximum z is 10, so effectiveness for C is maximized at z=10.Hmm, so if each supplement's effectiveness is maximized at their upper limit of 10 units, but the total can't exceed 20, which is less than 30 (the sum of 10+10+10). So, we can't take all three at 10 each.Therefore, we need to distribute the 20 units among x, y, z in such a way that the total effectiveness is maximized.I think the next step is to set up the Lagrangian. Let me recall that the Lagrangian function is the objective function minus the sum of multipliers times the constraints.But wait, since we have inequality constraints, we might need to consider which constraints are binding. That is, whether the maximum is achieved at the interior point or on the boundary defined by the constraints.But since each supplement's effectiveness is maximized at 10, but the total is limited to 20, it's likely that the optimal solution will be at the boundary where x + y + z = 20.So, perhaps I can set up the problem with the equality constraint ( x + y + z = 20 ) and then use Lagrange multipliers.Let me write the Lagrangian:( mathcal{L}(x, y, z, lambda) = 5x - 0.1x^2 + 10y - 0.2y^2 + 8z - 0.15z^2 - lambda(x + y + z - 20) )Then, take the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and set them equal to zero.Partial derivative with respect to x:( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial x} = 5 - 0.2x - lambda = 0 ) --> Equation 1: ( 5 - 0.2x - lambda = 0 )Partial derivative with respect to y:( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial y} = 10 - 0.4y - lambda = 0 ) --> Equation 2: ( 10 - 0.4y - lambda = 0 )Partial derivative with respect to z:( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial z} = 8 - 0.3z - lambda = 0 ) --> Equation 3: ( 8 - 0.3z - lambda = 0 )Partial derivative with respect to λ:( frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = -(x + y + z - 20) = 0 ) --> Equation 4: ( x + y + z = 20 )So, from Equations 1, 2, 3, we can express λ in terms of x, y, z:From Equation 1: ( lambda = 5 - 0.2x )From Equation 2: ( lambda = 10 - 0.4y )From Equation 3: ( lambda = 8 - 0.3z )Therefore, we can set them equal:( 5 - 0.2x = 10 - 0.4y ) --> Let's call this Equation 5and( 5 - 0.2x = 8 - 0.3z ) --> Equation 6So, Equation 5: ( 5 - 0.2x = 10 - 0.4y )Simplify:( -0.2x + 0.4y = 5 )Divide both sides by 0.2:( -x + 2y = 25 ) --> Equation 5a: ( -x + 2y = 25 )Equation 6: ( 5 - 0.2x = 8 - 0.3z )Simplify:( -0.2x + 0.3z = 3 )Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:( -2x + 3z = 30 ) --> Equation 6a: ( -2x + 3z = 30 )Now, we have two equations (5a and 6a) and three variables, but we also have Equation 4: ( x + y + z = 20 ). So, let's solve this system.From Equation 5a: ( -x + 2y = 25 ) --> Let's express x in terms of y:( x = 2y - 25 )From Equation 6a: ( -2x + 3z = 30 ). Let's substitute x from above:( -2(2y - 25) + 3z = 30 )Simplify:( -4y + 50 + 3z = 30 )( -4y + 3z = -20 ) --> Equation 7: ( -4y + 3z = -20 )Now, from Equation 4: ( x + y + z = 20 ). Substitute x = 2y -25:( (2y -25) + y + z = 20 )Simplify:( 3y -25 + z = 20 )( 3y + z = 45 ) --> Equation 8: ( 3y + z = 45 )Now, we have Equations 7 and 8:Equation 7: ( -4y + 3z = -20 )Equation 8: ( 3y + z = 45 )Let me solve Equation 8 for z:( z = 45 - 3y )Substitute into Equation 7:( -4y + 3(45 - 3y) = -20 )Simplify:( -4y + 135 - 9y = -20 )Combine like terms:( -13y + 135 = -20 )( -13y = -155 )( y = (-155)/(-13) = 155/13 ≈ 11.923 )Wait, but y is supposed to be at most 10. So, y ≈ 11.923 is beyond the maximum allowed. That can't be. So, this suggests that our initial assumption that the maximum is achieved at the interior point (where all constraints are binding except the individual maxima) is incorrect.Therefore, we need to consider that one or more variables are at their maximum.So, perhaps y is at its maximum of 10. Let's try that.If y = 10, then from Equation 5a: ( -x + 2*10 = 25 ) --> ( -x + 20 = 25 ) --> ( -x = 5 ) --> x = -5But x can't be negative. So, that's not possible. Therefore, if y is at 10, x would have to be negative, which isn't allowed. So, perhaps y is less than 10, but x is at its maximum of 10.Wait, let's try setting x = 10.If x = 10, then from Equation 1: ( lambda = 5 - 0.2*10 = 5 - 2 = 3 )From Equation 2: ( lambda = 10 - 0.4y = 3 ) --> ( 10 - 0.4y = 3 ) --> ( -0.4y = -7 ) --> y = 17.5But y can't exceed 10. So, y would have to be 10.But if x =10 and y=10, then z = 20 -10 -10 =0.So, let's check the effectiveness:E_A(10) = 5*10 -0.1*100=50 -10=40E_B(10)=10*10 -0.2*100=100 -20=80E_C(0)=0Total effectiveness=40+80+0=120But maybe we can get a higher effectiveness by not setting x and y to 10.Wait, let's see. Maybe if we reduce y a bit, we can increase z, which might give a higher total effectiveness.Alternatively, perhaps setting z to 10.If z=10, then from Equation 3: ( lambda =8 -0.3*10=8 -3=5 )From Equation 1: ( 5 -0.2x =5 ) --> 0.2x=0 --> x=0From Equation 2: ( 10 -0.4y =5 ) --> 0.4y=5 --> y=12.5, which is over 10. So, not possible.Thus, if z=10, y would have to be 10, and x=0.So, effectiveness:E_A(0)=0E_B(10)=80E_C(10)=8*10 -0.15*100=80 -15=65Total effectiveness=0+80+65=145Wait, that's higher than 120. So, 145 is better.But is that the maximum? Maybe.Wait, let's see. If we set z=10, y=10, x=0, total effectiveness is 145.But perhaps we can have a combination where x is something, y is 10, and z is 10 - x?Wait, no, because x + y + z <=20, but if y=10 and z=10, then x=0.Alternatively, maybe if we don't set y=10, but set z=10, and have x and y less than 10.Wait, let's try another approach.Since the effectiveness functions are concave, the maximum is achieved either at the boundaries or where the derivatives are equal.But since we can't have y=155/13≈11.923, which is beyond 10, we have to consider that y is capped at 10.Similarly, if we set y=10, then from Equation 5a: x=2y -25=20 -25=-5, which is invalid. So, perhaps we need to set x=0.Wait, if x=0, then from Equation 1: λ=5 -0=5From Equation 2: 10 -0.4y =5 --> y=12.5, which is too high.From Equation 3: 8 -0.3z=5 --> 0.3z=3 --> z=10.So, if x=0, y=12.5, z=10, but y can't be 12.5. So, y=10, z=10, x=0, as above.Alternatively, maybe set y=10, z=10, x=0.But let's see if we can get a higher effectiveness by not capping y or z at 10.Wait, but if we don't cap them, the solution goes beyond the constraints. So, perhaps the maximum is indeed at x=0, y=10, z=10, giving total effectiveness of 145.But let me check another scenario. Suppose we set x=10, then y and z must satisfy y + z=10.From Equation 1: λ=5 -0.2*10=3From Equation 2: 10 -0.4y=3 --> y=17.5, which is too high.From Equation 3: 8 -0.3z=3 --> z= (8-3)/0.3=5/0.3≈16.666, which is too high.So, if x=10, then y and z would have to be higher than 10, which is not allowed. So, x=10 is not feasible unless y and z are reduced.Wait, but if x=10, then y + z=10.But from the effectiveness functions, E_B(y) and E_C(z) are both increasing functions up to y=25 and z≈26.666, but constrained at 10.So, to maximize E_B and E_C, we should set y and z as high as possible, i.e., 10 each, but x=0.Wait, but if x=10, y=10, z=0, total effectiveness is 40+80+0=120, which is less than 145.So, 145 is better.Alternatively, what if we set x=5, y=10, z=5.Then, E_A=5*5 -0.1*25=25 -2.5=22.5E_B=10*10 -0.2*100=100 -20=80E_C=8*5 -0.15*25=40 -3.75=36.25Total=22.5+80+36.25=138.75, which is less than 145.Alternatively, x=0, y=10, z=10: 0 +80 +65=145.Alternatively, x=0, y=9, z=11. But z can't exceed 10.Wait, z=10, y=10, x=0 is the maximum possible under constraints.But let's check another point. Suppose x=0, y=10, z=10: total effectiveness 145.Alternatively, x=0, y=9, z=11: but z can't be 11.Alternatively, x=0, y=10, z=10 is the maximum.Wait, but let's see if we can get a higher effectiveness by not capping y or z at 10, but adjusting x, y, z within the constraints.Wait, but the maximum for each is 10, so we can't go beyond that.Alternatively, maybe setting x=0, y=10, z=10 is indeed the maximum.But let me check another approach. Since the effectiveness functions are quadratic, their marginal effectiveness (derivative) decreases as x, y, z increase.So, the marginal effectiveness for A is 5 -0.2x.For B: 10 -0.4y.For C: 8 -0.3z.At the optimal point, the marginal effectiveness should be equal across all supplements, but due to constraints, we might have to set some variables at their maximum.So, if we set x=0, y=10, z=10, then the marginal effectiveness for A is 5, for B is 10 -0.4*10=6, for C is 8 -0.3*10=5.So, the marginal effectiveness for A and C are equal at 5, but B is 6. So, perhaps we can reallocate some units from A to B to increase total effectiveness.But wait, x is already 0, so we can't take from A. Alternatively, take from C and give to B.Wait, if we reduce z by 1, we can increase y by 1 (since x=0, y + z=20, but y and z are capped at 10 each. Wait, no, if x=0, y + z=20, but y and z can't exceed 10 each. So, y=10, z=10 is the maximum.Wait, no, if x=0, y + z=20, but each can be up to 10. So, y=10, z=10 is allowed because 10+10=20.Wait, but in that case, y=10, z=10, x=0 is the only way to reach 20 units with both y and z at 10.So, perhaps that is indeed the optimal.But let me check the marginal effectiveness again.At x=0, y=10, z=10:Marginal A: 5Marginal B: 6Marginal C:5So, since B has higher marginal effectiveness, we might want to allocate more to B, but we can't because y is already at 10.Therefore, we can't increase y further, so we have to leave it as is.Thus, the optimal is x=0, y=10, z=10, with total effectiveness 145.Wait, but let me check another point. Suppose x=0, y=10, z=10: total effectiveness 145.Alternatively, x=0, y=9, z=11: but z can't be 11.Alternatively, x=0, y=10, z=10 is the maximum.Alternatively, what if we set x=0, y=10, z=10: total effectiveness 145.Alternatively, if we set x=0, y=10, z=10, that's the maximum.Wait, but let me think again. The effectiveness function for B is higher than for C. So, perhaps we should prioritize B over C.But since both y and z are capped at 10, and x is 0, we can't do more.Alternatively, if we reduce z below 10, we can increase y beyond 10, but y is capped at 10.So, no, we can't.Therefore, the optimal is x=0, y=10, z=10.Wait, but let me check the effectiveness at x=0, y=10, z=10:E_A=0E_B=10*10 -0.2*100=100 -20=80E_C=8*10 -0.15*100=80 -15=65Total=80+65=145.Alternatively, if we set x=0, y=10, z=10, that's 145.Alternatively, if we set x=0, y=10, z=10, that's the maximum.Wait, but let me check another scenario where x is not zero.Suppose x=5, y=10, z=5.E_A=5*5 -0.1*25=25 -2.5=22.5E_B=80E_C=8*5 -0.15*25=40 -3.75=36.25Total=22.5+80+36.25=138.75 <145.So, less.Alternatively, x=2, y=10, z=8.E_A=10 -0.4=9.6E_B=80E_C=64 -0.15*64=64 -9.6=54.4Total=9.6+80+54.4=144 <145.Still less.Alternatively, x=1, y=10, z=9.E_A=5 -0.1=4.9E_B=80E_C=72 -0.15*81=72 -12.15=59.85Total=4.9+80+59.85≈144.75 <145.Still less.Alternatively, x=0, y=10, z=10:145.Alternatively, x=0, y=9, z=11: invalid.Alternatively, x=0, y=10, z=10 is the maximum.Therefore, the optimal quantities are x=0, y=10, z=10.But wait, let me check if we can have a higher effectiveness by not capping y or z at 10, but adjusting x, y, z within the constraints.Wait, but the maximum for y and z is 10, so we can't go beyond that.Alternatively, perhaps the optimal is not at the corners, but somewhere in between, but due to the constraints, we have to cap y and z at 10.Wait, but earlier when we tried to solve the Lagrangian, we got y≈11.923, which is beyond 10, so we have to cap y at 10, and then see what x and z would be.But when we set y=10, we get x=2*10 -25= -5, which is invalid, so we have to set x=0, and then z=20 -0 -10=10.So, that's consistent.Therefore, the optimal is x=0, y=10, z=10.Now, moving to the second part, where there's an additional constraint: 2x + 3y + z =30.So, now we have two constraints:1. x + y + z ≤202. 2x + 3y + z =30But wait, 2x +3y +z=30 and x+y+z≤20.But if 2x +3y +z=30 and x+y+z≤20, then subtracting the second from the first:(2x +3y +z) - (x + y + z) =30 -20 --> x +2y=10.So, x +2y=10.But also, x + y + z ≤20.But since 2x +3y +z=30, we can express z=30 -2x -3y.Substitute into x + y + z ≤20:x + y + (30 -2x -3y) ≤20Simplify:x + y +30 -2x -3y ≤20(-x -2y) +30 ≤20- x -2y ≤ -10Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality sign reverses):x +2y ≥10But from earlier, x +2y=10.So, the only way both constraints are satisfied is if x +2y=10 and x + y + z=20.Wait, but z=30 -2x -3y.So, substituting x +2y=10 into z:z=30 -2x -3y=30 -2x -3y.But x=10 -2y.So, z=30 -2*(10 -2y) -3y=30 -20 +4y -3y=10 + y.So, z=10 + y.But z must be ≤10, so 10 + y ≤10 --> y ≤0.But y ≥0, so y=0.Thus, y=0, then x=10 -2*0=10.z=10 +0=10.So, x=10, y=0, z=10.But wait, let's check if this satisfies all constraints.x + y + z=10+0+10=20 ≤20: yes.2x +3y +z=20 +0 +10=30: yes.Also, x=10 ≤10, y=0 ≤10, z=10 ≤10: all satisfied.So, the only solution is x=10, y=0, z=10.But let's check the effectiveness:E_A=5*10 -0.1*100=50 -10=40E_B=10*0 -0.2*0=0E_C=8*10 -0.15*100=80 -15=65Total effectiveness=40+0+65=105.But is this the maximum?Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let me think.We have x +2y=10 and z=10 + y.But z must be ≤10, so y must be ≤0, which implies y=0.So, the only solution is x=10, y=0, z=10.But let's see if we can have y>0.Suppose y=1, then x=10 -2*1=8, z=10 +1=11, which is over the limit for z. So, z=10, then y=0.Alternatively, if y=1, z=10, then from x +2y=10, x=10 -2=8.But then z=10, y=1, x=8.Check 2x +3y +z=16 +3 +10=29≠30. So, not satisfying the second constraint.Wait, but z=10, y=1, x=8: 2*8 +3*1 +10=16+3+10=29≠30.So, to satisfy 2x +3y +z=30, with z=10, y=1, x=8, we need 2x +3y +z=30.But 2*8 +3*1 +10=29, which is less than 30. So, we need to adjust.Wait, but if we set z=10, then from 2x +3y +10=30 --> 2x +3y=20.Also, from x +2y=10.So, we have:2x +3y=20x +2y=10Let me solve these two equations.From the second equation: x=10 -2y.Substitute into the first equation:2*(10 -2y) +3y=2020 -4y +3y=2020 -y=20-y=0 --> y=0.Thus, y=0, x=10, z=10.So, indeed, the only solution is x=10, y=0, z=10.Therefore, the optimal quantities under the new constraint are x=10, y=0, z=10, with total effectiveness 105.But wait, is this the maximum? Let me check if there's another way.Suppose we relax the constraints. Wait, but the constraints are strict: 2x +3y +z=30 and x + y + z ≤20.But as we saw, the only way to satisfy both is x=10, y=0, z=10.So, the effectiveness is 105.But let me check if we can have a higher effectiveness by violating the constraints, but I don't think so because constraints are hard.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.Wait, let's try to set up the Lagrangian with both constraints.But since the second constraint is an equality, and the first is an inequality, but in this case, the equality constraint 2x +3y +z=30 and the inequality x + y + z ≤20 are such that the only feasible solution is x=10, y=0, z=10.Therefore, the optimal is x=10, y=0, z=10.But let me check the effectiveness again.E_A=40, E_B=0, E_C=65, total=105.Alternatively, if we could have y>0, but as we saw, it's not possible without violating the constraints.Therefore, the optimal is x=10, y=0, z=10.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a way to have y>0 by adjusting x and z.Wait, suppose y=1, then from x +2y=10, x=8.From 2x +3y +z=30, 16 +3 +z=30 --> z=11, which is over the limit.So, z=10, then 2x +3y=20.With x=8, y=1, 2*8 +3*1=16 +3=19≠20.So, to get 20, we need 2x +3y=20.With x=10 -2y.So, 2*(10 -2y) +3y=20 -->20 -4y +3y=20 -->20 -y=20 --> y=0.Thus, y=0 is the only solution.Therefore, the optimal is x=10, y=0, z=10.So, to summarize:1. Without the additional constraint, the optimal is x=0, y=10, z=10, total effectiveness 145.2. With the additional constraint 2x +3y +z=30, the optimal is x=10, y=0, z=10, total effectiveness 105.But wait, let me check if there's another way to satisfy both constraints with y>0.Wait, suppose we set y=5, then from x +2y=10, x=0.Then, z=10 +y=15, which is over the limit.So, z=10, then 2x +3y=20.With x=0, y=5, 2*0 +3*5=15≠20.So, need 2x +3y=20.With x=0, y=20/3≈6.666, but z=10 +6.666≈16.666>10.So, z=10, then 2x +3y=20.With x=0, y=20/3≈6.666, but z=10.But then, x + y + z=0 +6.666 +10≈16.666≤20: satisfies.But does 2x +3y +z=30?2*0 +3*6.666 +10≈0 +20 +10=30: yes.So, x=0, y≈6.666, z=10.But y can't exceed 10, so y≈6.666 is allowed.Wait, but earlier, when I tried to solve the system, I thought y had to be 0, but maybe I was wrong.Wait, let me re-examine.We have two constraints:1. x +2y=102. 2x +3y +z=30And z=10 +y.But z must be ≤10, so y≤0.Wait, but if z=10 +y, and z≤10, then y≤0.But y≥0, so y=0.But wait, if we don't set z=10 +y, but instead, set z=10, then from 2x +3y +10=30 -->2x +3y=20.And from x +2y=10.So, solving:From x=10 -2y.Substitute into 2x +3y=20:2*(10 -2y) +3y=20 -->20 -4y +3y=20 -->20 -y=20 -->y=0.Thus, y=0, x=10, z=10.But wait, what if we don't set z=10 +y, but instead, set z=10, and then y can be positive.Wait, but from the first constraint, x +2y=10.From the second constraint, 2x +3y +z=30.If z=10, then 2x +3y=20.But x=10 -2y.So, 2*(10 -2y) +3y=20 -->20 -4y +3y=20 -->20 -y=20 -->y=0.Thus, y=0, x=10, z=10.So, the only solution is y=0.Therefore, the optimal is x=10, y=0, z=10.But wait, earlier I thought of setting y=6.666, but that would require z=16.666, which is over the limit.So, the only way to satisfy both constraints is y=0, x=10, z=10.Thus, the optimal is x=10, y=0, z=10.Therefore, the answers are:1. x=0, y=10, z=10.2. x=10, y=0, z=10."},{"question":"As a corporate finance expert, Alex frequently evaluates investment opportunities.

She prepares a solution with 150 milliliters of enzyme, 200 milliliters of substrate, and 50 milliliters of buffer. According to her model, for every 10 milliliters of enzyme, there should be 15 milliliters of substrate and 5 milliliters of buffer to achieve optimal reaction conditions. Has Dr. Smith mixed her solution according to the model's prediction? Calculate the total volumes of enzyme, substrate, and buffer needed based on the model's ratio and compare them with the actual volumes Dr. Smith used.","answer":"First, I need to understand the model's ratio. For every 10 milliliters of enzyme, there should be 15 milliliters of substrate and 5 milliliters of buffer. This means the ratio of enzyme to substrate to buffer is 10:15:5, which simplifies to 2:3:1.Next, I'll determine the scaling factor based on the actual volume of enzyme used. Dr. Smith used 150 milliliters of enzyme. To find out how many times the base ratio is scaled, I'll divide the actual enzyme volume by the enzyme part of the ratio: 150 ÷ 2 = 75.Now, I'll calculate the required volumes for substrate and buffer using this scaling factor. For substrate, it's 3 parts multiplied by 75, which equals 225 milliliters. For buffer, it's 1 part multiplied by 75, resulting in 75 milliliters.Finally, I'll compare these calculated volumes with what Dr. Smith actually used. She used 200 milliliters of substrate instead of the required 225 milliliters and 50 milliliters of buffer instead of 75 milliliters. Since these volumes don't match the model's prediction, Dr. Smith did not mix her solution according to the model's ratio."},{"question":"Emily wants to buy a new bike that costs 180. She has already saved 45. She earns 8 for every pet she walks. If she walks 2 pets each day after school, how many more days will she have to walk pets before she can afford to buy the bike?","answer":"First, I need to determine how much more money Emily needs to buy the bike. The bike costs 180, and she has already saved 45. So, the remaining amount she needs is 180 minus 45, which equals 135.Next, I'll calculate how much Emily earns each day from walking pets. She earns 8 for each pet she walks and walks 2 pets each day. Therefore, her daily earnings are 8 multiplied by 2, totaling 16 per day.Finally, to find out how many more days Emily needs to walk pets to afford the bike, I'll divide the remaining amount she needs (135) by her daily earnings (16). This gives approximately 8.4375 days. Since Emily can't walk pets for a fraction of a day, she will need to work for 9 full days to earn enough money to buy the bike."},{"question":"Professor Sarcasm loves to make a point about practical skills over academic learning. To demonstrate this, he decides to build a bookshelf for his office. He has three different types of wood planks: Type A, Type B, and Type C. - Type A planks are 4 feet long, and he has 5 of them.- Type B planks are 3 feet long, and he has 7 of them.- Type C planks are 2 feet long, and he has 10 of them.Professor Sarcasm sarcastically claims, \\"Who needs philosophy when you can build a bookshelf in a day?!” as he plans to use all the planks to make his bookshelf. If each shelf requires a total of 8 feet of wood, how many full shelves can Professor Sarcasm construct using all the planks?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total length of wood Professor Sarcasm has by calculating the combined length of all the planks.Type A planks are 4 feet long, and there are 5 of them, so the total length for Type A is 4 * 5 = 20 feet.Type B planks are 3 feet long, and there are 7 of them, so the total length for Type B is 3 * 7 = 21 feet.Type C planks are 2 feet long, and there are 10 of them, so the total length for Type C is 2 * 10 = 20 feet.Adding these together, the total length of wood available is 20 + 21 + 20 = 61 feet.Each shelf requires 8 feet of wood. To find out how many full shelves can be constructed, I divide the total length by the length needed per shelf: 61 / 8 = 7.625.Since Professor Sarcasm can only build whole shelves, I take the integer part of the division, which is 7.Therefore, Professor Sarcasm can construct 7 full shelves using all the planks."},{"question":"Dr. Alex, a Psychology PhD candidate, is studying how machine learning algorithms influence human behavior.

Calculate the probability that a randomly selected household from the survey will have between 100 and 140 total interactions.","answer":"Alright, so I've got these two sub-problems to solve. Let me start with the first one.**Sub-problem 1:**We need to find the minimum number of positive interactions ( I_i ) required for a household to be considered successfully integrated. The success is measured by the function ( S_i = frac{2^{C_i}}{P_i} cdot log left( frac{I_i}{T_i} right) ), and the threshold is ( S_i geq 5 ).Given:- ( C_i = 3 ) children- ( P_i = 2 ) parents- ( T_i = 100 ) total interactionsSo, plugging these into the formula:( S_i = frac{2^3}{2} cdot log left( frac{I_i}{100} right) )First, compute ( 2^3 ) which is 8. Then divide by 2, so that's 4. So the equation simplifies to:( S_i = 4 cdot log left( frac{I_i}{100} right) )We need this to be at least 5:( 4 cdot log left( frac{I_i}{100} right) geq 5 )Let me solve for ( log left( frac{I_i}{100} right) ):Divide both sides by 4:( log left( frac{I_i}{100} right) geq frac{5}{4} )Assuming the logarithm is natural (base e), but sometimes in these contexts, it might be base 10. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. Wait, in mathematics, log without a base is often natural log, but in some contexts, it's base 10. Hmm, but in self-help studies, maybe they use base 10? Hmm, not sure. Wait, let me check the units. If it's base 10, the numbers would be smaller, but if it's natural log, the numbers would be larger. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \\"the ratio of positive interactions to total interactions\\", so ( frac{I_i}{T_i} ) is a ratio between 0 and 1, so the log would be negative if it's natural log, but positive if it's base 10? Wait, no, actually, log of a number less than 1 is negative regardless of the base. Wait, but the success function is given as ( S_i = frac{2^{C_i}}{P_i} cdot log left( frac{I_i}{T_i} right) ). So, if ( I_i < T_i ), then ( frac{I_i}{T_i} < 1 ), so log is negative. But the success threshold is ( S_i geq 5 ), which is positive. Hmm, that seems contradictory because if the log is negative, multiplying by a positive number would make ( S_i ) negative, which can't be greater than 5. So, maybe the log is base 10? Wait, no, because even base 10, log of a number less than 1 is negative. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the function. Wait, perhaps the log is of the ratio ( frac{I_i}{T_i} ), but if ( I_i ) is positive interactions, then ( I_i ) must be less than or equal to ( T_i ), so the ratio is between 0 and 1, so log is negative. But the success function is supposed to be positive? Hmm, maybe the log is actually the absolute value? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be ( log left( frac{T_i}{I_i} right) )? Wait, but the problem says ( log left( frac{I_i}{T_i} right) ). Hmm, maybe the function is defined as the log of the ratio, but since it's negative, the success function would be negative, but the threshold is positive. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to double-check.Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be ( log left( frac{T_i}{I_i} right) ). Because if ( I_i ) is positive, and ( T_i ) is total, then ( frac{T_i}{I_i} ) is greater than or equal to 1, so log is positive. That would make sense because then ( S_i ) would be positive. Alternatively, maybe it's the absolute value of the log? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, let's read the problem again: \\"the ratio of positive interactions to total interactions within the household.\\" So, ( frac{I_i}{T_i} ). So, if ( I_i ) is the number of positive interactions, then ( frac{I_i}{T_i} ) is between 0 and 1. So, log of that is negative. So, ( S_i ) would be negative, but the threshold is 5, which is positive. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the function is actually ( log left( frac{T_i}{I_i} right) ), which would be positive if ( I_i < T_i ). Alternatively, maybe it's the absolute value of the log? Or maybe it's a different base where the log is positive? Wait, no, because regardless of the base, log of a number less than 1 is negative.Wait, maybe the function is ( log left( frac{I_i}{T_i} right) ), but with the understanding that it's the absolute value? Or perhaps it's a different kind of log, like the log-odds or something else. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that it's natural log, even though it results in a negative number, but since the threshold is positive, perhaps the function is actually defined as the absolute value? Or maybe the problem has a typo.Alternatively, perhaps the function is ( log left( frac{I_i}{T_i - I_i} right) ), but that's not what's written. Hmm.Wait, maybe I should proceed with the given function, even if it results in a negative number, and see where that takes me. So, ( S_i = 4 cdot log left( frac{I_i}{100} right) geq 5 ). So, solving for ( I_i ):( log left( frac{I_i}{100} right) geq frac{5}{4} )Assuming natural log, let's exponentiate both sides:( frac{I_i}{100} geq e^{5/4} )Compute ( e^{5/4} ). 5/4 is 1.25. ( e^{1.25} ) is approximately 3.490.So, ( I_i geq 100 times 3.490 = 349 ). But wait, ( I_i ) is the number of positive interactions, and ( T_i = 100 ). So, ( I_i ) can't be more than 100. That's impossible. So, that can't be right.Hmm, that suggests that with ( T_i = 100 ), ( I_i ) can't exceed 100, so ( frac{I_i}{100} leq 1 ), so ( log left( frac{I_i}{100} right) leq 0 ). So, ( S_i ) would be non-positive, which can't be greater than or equal to 5. So, that suggests that with ( T_i = 100 ), it's impossible to have ( S_i geq 5 ). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the minimum ( I_i ) required. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the log.Wait, maybe the log is base 10? Let's try that.So, if it's base 10, then:( log_{10} left( frac{I_i}{100} right) geq frac{5}{4} )Which is:( frac{I_i}{100} geq 10^{5/4} )Compute ( 10^{5/4} ). 5/4 is 1.25. ( 10^{1.25} ) is approximately 17.7828.So, ( I_i geq 100 times 17.7828 = 1778.28 ). But again, ( I_i ) can't exceed ( T_i = 100 ). So, that's also impossible.Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the function is actually ( log left( frac{T_i}{I_i} right) ) instead? Let's try that.So, if the function is ( S_i = frac{2^{C_i}}{P_i} cdot log left( frac{T_i}{I_i} right) ), then:( S_i = 4 cdot log left( frac{100}{I_i} right) geq 5 )Assuming natural log:( log left( frac{100}{I_i} right) geq frac{5}{4} )Exponentiate both sides:( frac{100}{I_i} geq e^{5/4} approx 3.490 )So, ( I_i leq frac{100}{3.490} approx 28.65 ). Since ( I_i ) must be an integer, the minimum ( I_i ) would be 29? Wait, but that would make ( S_i = 4 cdot log(100/29) approx 4 cdot log(3.448) approx 4 cdot 1.238 approx 4.95 ), which is just below 5. So, maybe 28?Wait, let's compute ( S_i ) for ( I_i = 28 ):( frac{100}{28} approx 3.571 )( log(3.571) approx 1.273 )So, ( 4 times 1.273 approx 5.092 ), which is just above 5. So, ( I_i = 28 ) would give ( S_i approx 5.092 geq 5 ). So, the minimum ( I_i ) is 28.But wait, the problem didn't specify whether the log is natural or base 10. If it's base 10, let's see:( log_{10}(100/28) approx log_{10}(3.571) approx 0.553 )So, ( 4 times 0.553 approx 2.212 ), which is less than 5. So, that doesn't work.So, if the log is natural, then ( I_i = 28 ) gives ( S_i approx 5.092 geq 5 ). So, that's the minimum.But wait, the problem didn't specify the base of the logarithm. Hmm, that's a problem. Because depending on the base, the result changes. Maybe the function is supposed to be base 10? But as we saw, that doesn't work because ( S_i ) would be too low.Alternatively, maybe the function is using log base 2? Let's try that.If it's log base 2:( log_2(100/28) approx log_2(3.571) approx 1.847 )So, ( 4 times 1.847 approx 7.388 geq 5 ). So, that works, but again, the problem didn't specify.Hmm, this is a bit of a conundrum. But given that in many mathematical contexts, log without a base is natural log, but in some engineering contexts, it's base 10. However, in computer science, it's often base 2. But the problem is about self-help and households, so maybe it's base 10? But as we saw, that doesn't give a feasible result.Alternatively, perhaps the function is actually ( ln left( frac{I_i}{T_i} right) ), but as we saw, that would require ( I_i ) to be greater than ( T_i ), which is impossible. So, perhaps the function is actually ( ln left( frac{T_i}{I_i} right) ), which would make sense because ( T_i ) is total interactions, and ( I_i ) is positive interactions, so ( T_i geq I_i ), so ( frac{T_i}{I_i} geq 1 ), so log is positive.Given that, let's proceed with natural log, as that seems more likely in a mathematical context.So, with ( S_i = 4 cdot ln left( frac{100}{I_i} right) geq 5 ), solving for ( I_i ):( ln left( frac{100}{I_i} right) geq frac{5}{4} )Exponentiate both sides:( frac{100}{I_i} geq e^{5/4} approx 3.490 )So, ( I_i leq frac{100}{3.490} approx 28.65 ). Since ( I_i ) must be an integer, the minimum ( I_i ) is 28. Let's verify:( frac{100}{28} approx 3.571 )( ln(3.571) approx 1.273 )( 4 times 1.273 approx 5.092 geq 5 ). So, yes, 28 is the minimum.But wait, the problem didn't specify the base, so maybe I should assume it's base 10? Let's see:If it's base 10, then:( log_{10} left( frac{100}{I_i} right) geq frac{5}{4} )Which is:( frac{100}{I_i} geq 10^{5/4} approx 17.7828 )So, ( I_i leq frac{100}{17.7828} approx 5.62 ). So, ( I_i = 5 ) would give:( frac{100}{5} = 20 )( log_{10}(20) approx 1.301 )( 4 times 1.301 approx 5.204 geq 5 ). So, ( I_i = 5 ) would suffice. But that seems too low, considering ( T_i = 100 ). Only 5 positive interactions? That seems unlikely, but mathematically, if it's base 10, that's the result.But given that the problem is about positive interactions, which are usually a significant portion, I think the base is more likely natural log. So, I'll proceed with that.Therefore, the minimum ( I_i ) is 28.Wait, but let me double-check. If ( I_i = 28 ), then ( S_i = 4 cdot ln(100/28) approx 4 cdot 1.273 approx 5.092 ), which is just above 5. So, yes, 28 is the minimum.**Sub-problem 2:**We need to find the probability that a randomly selected household has between 100 and 140 total interactions, given that ( T_i ) follows a normal distribution with ( mu = 120 ) and ( sigma = 15 ).So, we're dealing with a normal distribution ( N(120, 15^2) ). We need to find ( P(100 leq T_i leq 140) ).First, we'll convert these values to z-scores.For ( T_i = 100 ):( z_1 = frac{100 - 120}{15} = frac{-20}{15} = -1.333 )For ( T_i = 140 ):( z_2 = frac{140 - 120}{15} = frac{20}{15} = 1.333 )So, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve between ( z = -1.333 ) and ( z = 1.333 ).Using a z-table or calculator, the cumulative probability for ( z = 1.333 ) is approximately 0.9082, and for ( z = -1.333 ) is approximately 0.0918.So, the probability between them is ( 0.9082 - 0.0918 = 0.8164 ).Therefore, the probability is approximately 81.64%.Alternatively, using more precise z-values, since 1.333 is approximately 1.33, which corresponds to 0.9082, and -1.33 corresponds to 0.0918. So, the difference is 0.8164, or 81.64%.So, the probability is about 81.64%.**Final Answer**Sub-problem 1: The minimum number of positive interactions required is boxed{28}.Sub-problem 2: The probability is approximately boxed{0.8164}."},{"question":"Sara Adam, the famous Maldivian actress, recently had a fan meet-and-greet event.

Each participant needs 250 grams, so multiplying 30 by 250 grams gives a total of 7,500 grams, which is equivalent to 7.5 kilograms.Next, I'll consider the yield from each bag of black beans. Each 1-kilogram bag can produce 4 servings of Feijoada. Since each serving is 250 grams, one bag can make 1,000 grams of Feijoada.To find out how many bags Ana needs, I'll divide the total required Feijoada (7.5 kilograms) by the amount one bag can produce (1 kilogram). This calculation shows that Ana needs 7.5 bags. However, since she can't purchase half a bag, she'll need to round up to the next whole number, which is 8 bags.Therefore, Ana should buy 8 bags of black beans to ensure she has enough for all 30 participants."},{"question":"An ambitious PhD candidate is studying the impact of social changes on contemporary Italian Art.

On a weekend, Jamie decides to practice skateboarding for 3 hours each on Saturday and Sunday. During each hour of practice, Jamie manages to perform 15 successful skateboard tricks. However, for every 5 successful tricks, Jamie takes a 2-minute break. If Jamie starts practicing at 10:00 AM each day, at what time will Jamie finish his practice on Sunday?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of hours Jamie practices each day. Jamie practices for 3 hours on both Saturday and Sunday, making a total of 6 hours.Next, I'll calculate the total number of successful tricks Jamie performs. Since Jamie does 15 tricks each hour, over 6 hours, that's 15 tricks/hour × 6 hours = 90 tricks.Now, I need to figure out how many breaks Jamie takes.
