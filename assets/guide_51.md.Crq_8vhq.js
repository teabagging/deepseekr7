All of A, B, and C are different non-zero digits. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the problem as it is:\`\`\`  A B A+ A B C+ A C C-------1416\`\`\`So, each letter represents a digit, and they all have to be different and non-zero. That means A, B, and C can be from 1 to 9, but no two letters can have the same digit.Let me think about how addition works column by column, starting from the rightmost digit (units place) and moving to the left, keeping in mind that there might be carries over to the next column.Let me denote the columns as units, tens, hundreds, and thousands.Starting with the units column:The units digits are A (from ABA), C (from ABC), and C (from ACC). So, adding them together: A + C + C = A + 2C. This sum should give us the units digit of 1416, which is 6. However, there might be a carryover from this addition to the tens column. Let me denote the carryover as k1, which can be 0 or 1 or 2, since the maximum sum without carryover is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27, but in our case, since A and C are single digits, the maximum sum is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27, but since they are different digits, the maximum would be 9 + 8 + 7 = 24, so the carryover can be up to 2.So, the equation for the units place is:A + 2C = 6 + 10*k1Where k1 is the carryover to the tens place, which can be 0, 1, or 2.Moving on to the tens column:The tens digits are B (from ABA), B (from ABC), and C (from ACC). So, adding them together: B + B + C = 2B + C. But we also have to add the carryover k1 from the previous column. So, the total is 2B + C + k1. The tens digit of the sum 1416 is 1, so:2B + C + k1 = 1 + 10*k2Where k2 is the carryover to the hundreds place, which can again be 0, 1, or 2.Next, the hundreds column:The hundreds digits are A (from ABA), A (from ABC), and A (from ACC). So, adding them together: A + A + A = 3A. Adding the carryover k2 from the tens column, we get 3A + k2. The hundreds digit of the sum is 4, so:3A + k2 = 4 + 10*k3Where k3 is the carryover to the thousands place, which can be 0 or 1, since 3A is at most 27 (if A=9), so 3A + k2 is at most 27 + 2 = 29, so k3 can be 0 or 2? Wait, 3A + k2 can be up to 27 + 2 = 29, so the carryover k3 can be 2? Wait, no, because 3A + k2 is equal to 4 + 10*k3. So, 3A + k2 must be between 4 and, say, 4 + 10*2 = 24, but 3A + k2 is at most 27 + 2 = 29, so k3 can be 0, 1, or 2. Hmm, but 3A + k2 = 4 + 10*k3. So, 3A + k2 must be in the range 4 to 24 (if k3=2, 4 + 20=24). So, k3 can be 0, 1, or 2.Finally, the thousands column:The thousands digits are the carryover k3 from the hundreds column. Since the sum is 1416, the thousands digit is 1. So:k3 = 1Because there are no digits beyond the thousands place in the addends, so the carryover k3 must be equal to 1.So, from the thousands place, we have k3 = 1.Now, let me summarize the equations we have:1. Units place: A + 2C = 6 + 10*k12. Tens place: 2B + C + k1 = 1 + 10*k23. Hundreds place: 3A + k2 = 4 + 10*k34. Thousands place: k3 = 1So, starting from the thousands place, we know k3 = 1.Plugging k3 = 1 into the hundreds place equation:3A + k2 = 4 + 10*1 => 3A + k2 = 14So, 3A + k2 = 14Since A is a digit from 1 to 9, let's see possible values for A.3A must be less than or equal to 14 - 0 = 14, so A can be at most 4 (since 3*5=15 >14). So possible A: 1,2,3,4.But A is a non-zero digit, so 1,2,3,4.Let me check each possible A:Case 1: A=4Then, 3*4 + k2 =14 => 12 + k2=14 => k2=2So, k2=2.Case 2: A=33*3 +k2=14 =>9 +k2=14 =>k2=5But k2 is a carryover from the tens place, which can only be 0,1, or 2. So k2=5 is impossible. So A cannot be 3.Case3: A=23*2 +k2=14 =>6 +k2=14 =>k2=8Again, k2=8 is impossible because carryover can only be 0,1,2. So A=2 is invalid.Case4: A=13*1 +k2=14 =>3 +k2=14 =>k2=11Which is impossible, as carryover can't be 11. So A=1 is invalid.Therefore, the only possible value is A=4, with k2=2.So, A=4, k2=2.Now, moving to the tens place equation:2B + C + k1 =1 +10*k2We know k2=2, so:2B + C + k1 =1 +10*2=21So, 2B + C + k1=21Now, let's remember that k1 is the carryover from the units place, which is either 0,1, or 2.So, 2B + C + k1=21But 2B + C can be at most 2*9 +9=27, but since B and C are different digits, and A=4, so B and C can't be 4.Wait, A=4, so B and C are from 1-9 excluding 4.So, 2B + C can be at most 2*9 +9=27, but since B and C are different, it's 2*9 +8=26.But 2B + C +k1=21, so 2B + C=21 -k1.Since k1 can be 0,1,2, so 2B + C=21,20,19.But 2B + C can't be more than 26, so 21,20,19 are all possible.But let's also remember that in the units place, A + 2C =6 +10*k1We have A=4, so 4 + 2C =6 +10*k1Which simplifies to:2C = 2 +10*k1So, 2C = 2 +10*k1Divide both sides by 2:C =1 +5*k1So, C must be 1 +5*k1Since C is a digit from 1-9, and k1 can be 0,1,2, let's see possible C:If k1=0: C=1If k1=1: C=6If k1=2: C=11, which is invalid because C must be a single digit.So, possible C: 1 or 6, with k1=0 or 1.So, two possibilities:1. k1=0, C=12. k1=1, C=6Let me check both cases.Case 1: k1=0, C=1Then, from the tens place equation:2B + C +k1=21 =>2B +1 +0=21 =>2B=20 =>B=10But B must be a single digit, so B=10 is invalid. So this case is impossible.Case 2: k1=1, C=6Then, from the tens place equation:2B + C +k1=21 =>2B +6 +1=21 =>2B +7=21 =>2B=14 =>B=7So, B=7.Now, let's check if all digits are unique and non-zero.A=4, B=7, C=6All are different and non-zero. Good.Now, let me verify the entire addition to make sure.So, ABA is 4 7 4 = 474ABC is 4 7 6 = 476ACC is 4 6 6 = 466Adding them together:474 + 476 + 466Let me compute step by step:474 + 476 = 950950 + 466 = 1416Yes, that's correct.So, the digits are A=4, B=7, C=6.Therefore, the solution is A=4, B=7, C=6.**Final Answer**The values of the digits are (A = boxed{4}), (B = boxed{7}), and (C = boxed{6})."},{"question":" f:R->R  such that :  f(1)=1  and for any  xin R  i)  f(x+5)geq f(x)+5 ii) f(x+1)leq f(x)+1 If  g(x)=f(x)+1-x  find g(2016)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find g(2016) given that g(x) = f(x) + 1 - x. The function f: R → R satisfies two conditions: f(1) = 1, and for any real number x, it must hold that f(x + 5) ≥ f(x) + 5 and f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me write down what I know:1. f(1) = 1.2. For any x, f(x + 5) ≥ f(x) + 5.3. For any x, f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1.4. g(x) = f(x) + 1 - x, so g(2016) = f(2016) + 1 - 2016.So, my goal is to find f(2016) because once I have that, subtracting 2015 from it will give me g(2016). So, how can I find f(2016)?Looking at the conditions given, they seem to relate the function's value at points that are 5 apart and 1 apart. Maybe I can use these inequalities to bound f(2016) in some way.Let me consider the second condition first: f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1. This suggests that the function doesn't increase too quickly. In fact, it can't increase by more than 1 when you move 1 unit to the right. Similarly, the first condition says that f(x + 5) is at least f(x) + 5, meaning that over an interval of 5 units, the function must increase by at least 5. So, over 5 units, it can't increase too slowly either.These two conditions seem to sandwich the function's growth between certain rates. Maybe I can use these to find exact values or at least tight bounds on f(x).Let me try to see if I can find a recursive relationship or something that can help me express f(2016) in terms of f(1). Since 2016 is a multiple of 1, perhaps I can use the second condition repeatedly.Wait, 2016 is 1 + 2015*1, so maybe I can apply the second condition 2015 times starting from f(1). Let's see:Starting with f(1) = 1.Then, f(2) ≤ f(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.Similarly, f(3) ≤ f(2) + 1 ≤ 2 + 1 = 3.Continuing this way, f(4) ≤ 4, f(5) ≤ 5, and so on.So, in general, for any integer n ≥ 1, f(n) ≤ n.But wait, is that the case? Let me check. If I keep applying f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1, then yes, each step adds at most 1, so starting from f(1) = 1, f(2) ≤ 2, f(3) ≤ 3, etc., so f(n) ≤ n for all integers n.But what about the first condition? It says f(x + 5) ≥ f(x) + 5. So, if I take x = 1, then f(6) ≥ f(1) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6.Similarly, x = 2: f(7) ≥ f(2) + 5. But I don't know f(2) exactly, only that f(2) ≤ 2. So, f(7) ≥ f(2) + 5 ≥ (something ≤ 2) + 5. Hmm, that doesn't give me a lower bound on f(7) because f(2) could be less than 2.Wait, maybe I need to combine both conditions. Let me think about how these inequalities can interact.Suppose I have f(x + 5) ≥ f(x) + 5 and f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1. Maybe I can iterate the second condition multiple times to get an upper bound on f(x + 5), and then compare it with the lower bound from the first condition.Let's try that. Starting from f(x), if I apply the second condition five times, I get:f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1f(x + 2) ≤ f(x + 1) + 1 ≤ f(x) + 2f(x + 3) ≤ f(x) + 3f(x + 4) ≤ f(x) + 4f(x + 5) ≤ f(x) + 5So, from the second condition, f(x + 5) ≤ f(x) + 5.But from the first condition, f(x + 5) ≥ f(x) + 5.Therefore, combining both, f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5.Ah! So, for any x, f(x + 5) must equal f(x) + 5.That's a key insight. So, the function f is additive with period 5. That is, every time you increase x by 5, f increases by exactly 5. So, f is linear with slope 1 over intervals of 5.But wait, does that mean f is linear everywhere? Not necessarily, but it has this additive property over steps of 5. Hmm.But also, from the second condition, f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1, which suggests that f can't increase faster than 1 per unit step. But we also have that f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5, which is exactly 1 per unit step over 5 units. So, maybe f is linear with slope 1 everywhere?Wait, let me test that. Suppose f(x) = x + c for some constant c. Then, f(1) = 1 + c = 1, so c = 0. Therefore, f(x) = x.Does this function satisfy both conditions?Check condition i): f(x + 5) = x + 5 = f(x) + 5. So, equality holds, which satisfies the inequality.Condition ii): f(x + 1) = x + 1 = f(x) + 1. Again, equality holds, which satisfies the inequality.So, f(x) = x is a solution. But is it the only solution?Wait, maybe not necessarily. Because the conditions are inequalities, there could be other functions that satisfy them without being strictly linear. For example, suppose f(x) = x + sin(2πx/5). Then, over 5 units, the sine function completes a full period, so f(x + 5) = x + 5 + sin(2π(x + 5)/5) = x + 5 + sin(2πx/5 + 2π) = x + 5 + sin(2πx/5) = f(x) + 5. So, condition i) is satisfied.What about condition ii)? Let's compute f(x + 1) - f(x) = (x + 1 + sin(2π(x + 1)/5)) - (x + sin(2πx/5)) = 1 + sin(2π(x + 1)/5) - sin(2πx/5). The sine terms can vary between -1 and 1, so the difference can be as low as 1 - 2 = -1 and as high as 1 + 2 = 3. But condition ii) requires that f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1, which would mean that f(x + 1) - f(x) ≤ 1. However, in this case, the difference can be up to 3, which violates the condition. So, this function doesn't satisfy condition ii). Therefore, such functions with oscillations might not satisfy both conditions.Alternatively, maybe f(x) is linear with slope 1, but with some bounded perturbations. Hmm, but given that over 5 units, the function must increase exactly by 5, any perturbation would have to cancel out over 5 units. So, if f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5, then any deviation from linearity must be periodic with period 5.But as I saw earlier, such deviations can cause f(x + 1) - f(x) to exceed 1, which violates condition ii). Therefore, perhaps the only function that satisfies both conditions is f(x) = x.Wait, let me test another function. Suppose f(x) = x + c, where c is a constant. Then, f(x + 5) = x + 5 + c = f(x) + 5, so condition i) is satisfied. Also, f(x + 1) = x + 1 + c = f(x) + 1, so condition ii) is also satisfied. So, any linear function with slope 1 satisfies both conditions. But wait, f(1) = 1 + c = 1, so c must be 0. Therefore, the only linear function that satisfies f(1) = 1 is f(x) = x.But could there be a non-linear function that still satisfies both conditions? Let me think.Suppose f(x) = x for all x except at some points where it's slightly less. For example, f(x) = x - ε for some ε > 0 at certain points. But then, when we look at f(x + 5), it would have to be f(x) + 5, so f(x + 5) = (x + 5) - ε = f(x) + 5. But f(x) = x - ε, so f(x) + 5 = x - ε + 5. Therefore, f(x + 5) must equal x + 5 - ε, which is consistent. So, if f(x) is x minus a constant ε everywhere, then f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5. But wait, f(1) would then be 1 - ε, which is not equal to 1 unless ε = 0. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, suppose f(x) is x plus some periodic function with period 5, but as I saw earlier, such functions can cause f(x + 1) - f(x) to exceed 1, which violates condition ii). Therefore, maybe f(x) must be exactly x.Alternatively, maybe f(x) is x plus a function that is 0 on integers but non-zero elsewhere. But then, for x = 1, f(1) = 1, which is good. For x = 2, f(2) ≤ f(1) + 1 = 2, but f(2) could be less than 2. However, from condition i), f(2 + 5) = f(7) ≥ f(2) + 5. But f(7) ≤ 7 because of condition ii). So, f(7) ≤ 7 and f(7) ≥ f(2) + 5. Therefore, 7 ≥ f(2) + 5, which implies f(2) ≤ 2. But we already have f(2) ≤ 2 from condition ii). So, that doesn't give us more information.Wait, but if f(2) ≤ 2 and f(7) ≥ f(2) + 5, then f(7) ≥ f(2) + 5 ≤ 2 + 5 = 7. So, f(7) ≥ 7 and f(7) ≤ 7. Therefore, f(7) must equal 7.Similarly, f(7) = 7. Then, using condition ii), f(8) ≤ f(7) + 1 = 8, and f(12) ≥ f(7) + 5 = 12. But f(12) ≤ 12, so f(12) must equal 12. Continuing this way, f(n) = n for all integers n.So, for integer x, f(x) = x. But what about non-integer x?Wait, let's take x = 1.5. Then, f(1.5 + 5) = f(6.5) ≥ f(1.5) + 5. Also, from condition ii), f(6.5) ≤ f(6) + 0.5. But f(6) = 6, so f(6.5) ≤ 6 + 0.5 = 6.5. Therefore, f(6.5) ≤ 6.5 and f(6.5) ≥ f(1.5) + 5. So, 6.5 ≥ f(1.5) + 5, which implies f(1.5) ≤ 1.5.Similarly, from condition ii), f(1.5) ≤ f(1) + 0.5 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5. So, f(1.5) ≤ 1.5. But also, from condition i), f(1.5 + 5) = f(6.5) ≥ f(1.5) + 5. But f(6.5) ≤ 6.5, so f(1.5) + 5 ≤ 6.5, which gives f(1.5) ≤ 1.5. So, combining both, f(1.5) must equal 1.5.Wait, so f(1.5) = 1.5. Similarly, maybe f(x) = x for all x?Wait, let me test x = 0.5. Then, f(0.5 + 5) = f(5.5) ≥ f(0.5) + 5. Also, f(5.5) ≤ f(5) + 0.5 = 5 + 0.5 = 5.5. So, f(5.5) ≤ 5.5 and f(5.5) ≥ f(0.5) + 5. Therefore, 5.5 ≥ f(0.5) + 5, which implies f(0.5) ≤ 0.5. Also, from condition ii), f(0.5) ≤ f(0) + 0.5. But wait, I don't know f(0). Hmm.Wait, do I have any information about f(0)? Let me think. From condition i), if I take x = -5, then f(0) ≥ f(-5) + 5. But I don't know f(-5). Similarly, from condition ii), f(-4) ≤ f(-5) + 1, but again, I don't know f(-5). Hmm, this seems tricky.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5 for all x. So, f is additive with period 5. So, f(x + 5n) = f(x) + 5n for any integer n. So, if I can express 2016 in terms of 5n + r, where r is the remainder when 2016 is divided by 5, then f(2016) = f(r) + 5n.Wait, 2016 divided by 5 is 403 with a remainder of 1, since 5*403 = 2015, so 2016 = 2015 + 1 = 5*403 + 1. Therefore, f(2016) = f(1) + 5*403 = 1 + 2015 = 2016.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, f(2016) = 2016. Therefore, g(2016) = f(2016) + 1 - 2016 = 2016 + 1 - 2016 = 1.But hold on, is this valid? Because I assumed that f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5, which I derived earlier by combining the two conditions. So, if f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5, then yes, f is linear with slope 1 over intervals of 5, but does that necessarily mean that f(x) = x for all x?Wait, earlier, I thought that f(x) might be equal to x for all x, but I wasn't sure. However, from the above reasoning, since f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5, and using condition ii), we can show that f(x) = x for all x.Wait, let me think again. Suppose f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1 and f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5. Let me consider x as any real number, not just integers.Let me take x = y - 5, so f(y) = f(y - 5) + 5.Similarly, from condition ii), f(y) ≤ f(y - 1) + 1.But f(y - 1) ≤ f(y - 2) + 1, and so on, until f(y - 5) ≤ f(y - 6) + 1.Wait, but f(y) = f(y - 5) + 5, so substituting, f(y) = f(y - 5) + 5 ≤ f(y - 6) + 1 + 5 = f(y - 6) + 6.But also, from condition i), f(y) = f(y - 5) + 5 ≥ f(y - 6) + 5 - 5? Wait, no, condition i) is about f(x + 5) ≥ f(x) + 5, so f(y) = f(y - 5) + 5 ≥ f(y - 5) + 5, which is just an equality.Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me consider that for any x, f(x + 1) ≤ f(x) + 1, and f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5. So, if I write f(x + 5) as f(x + 4 + 1) ≤ f(x + 4) + 1 ≤ f(x + 3) + 2 ≤ ... ≤ f(x) + 5. But we also have f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5. Therefore, all the inequalities must be equalities. So, f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 for all x.Wait, that's a key point. If f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5 and f(x + 5) ≤ f(x) + 5 (from condition ii) applied five times), then f(x + 5) must equal f(x) + 5, and all the intermediate steps must also be equalities. Therefore, f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 for all x.So, f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 for all x. That means f is a function with period 1 additive, i.e., f(x + n) = f(x) + n for any integer n. But combined with f(x + 5) = f(x) + 5, which is a special case of this, it's consistent.Wait, but if f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 for all x, then f is a function with slope 1 everywhere. Because for any x, the difference f(x + 1) - f(x) = 1, which is the definition of a linear function with slope 1. Therefore, f(x) = x + c for some constant c.But we know that f(1) = 1, so plugging in x = 1, f(1) = 1 + c = 1, so c = 0. Therefore, f(x) = x for all x.So, f(x) = x is the only function that satisfies both conditions. Therefore, f(2016) = 2016, and so g(2016) = f(2016) + 1 - 2016 = 2016 + 1 - 2016 = 1.Therefore, the answer is 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"The sum of two positive integers is less than 100, and one is twice the other.

The function f(N) counts the number of non-marked vertices when the process stops. Part (a) asks me to prove that if f(N) = 0, then 2N + 1 must be a prime number. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this.First, let me visualize the setup. We have a regular polygon with 2N sides, so it's like a 2N-gon. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N clockwise, and then from -N to -1 clockwise as well. So, the numbering goes 1, 2, ..., N, -N, -N+1, ..., -2, -1. That means vertex N is next to vertex -N, right? So, it's like a circle with these numbers arranged in that order.Now, the marking process starts at vertex 1. Then, each subsequent step involves moving |ni| vertices away from the current vertex, clockwise if ni is positive and counter-clockwise if ni is negative. So, starting at 1, which is positive, we move 1 vertex clockwise. That would take us to vertex 2. Then, from 2, which is positive, we move 2 vertices clockwise. That would take us to vertex 4. From 4, positive again, move 4 vertices clockwise. Hmm, wait, but the polygon only has 2N vertices, so moving 4 vertices from 4 would take us to vertex 8, but if 8 is beyond N, we have to wrap around to the negative side.Wait, actually, the numbering is 1, 2, ..., N, -N, -N+1, ..., -1. So, moving clockwise from 4 by 4 vertices: let's say N is 5 for example, so the vertices are 1,2,3,4,5,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1. So, moving 4 from 4 would go to 8, but since there are only 10 vertices, 8 would correspond to -2. So, in general, moving k vertices clockwise from a vertex m would be equivalent to (m + k - 1) mod 2N, but adjusted for the numbering.Wait, maybe I should think of the vertices as being labeled from 0 to 2N-1, but then mapped to the given numbering. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the movement as addition modulo 2N, but with the labels adjusted accordingly.Wait, let me think again. The movement is |ni| vertices away, clockwise if ni is positive, counter-clockwise if ni is negative. So, starting at 1, which is positive, we move 1 clockwise to 2. Then, from 2, positive, move 2 clockwise to 4. From 4, positive, move 4 clockwise. If 4 + 4 = 8, but if 8 exceeds N, we have to map it to the negative side. Wait, but how exactly?Wait, perhaps the key is to model the positions as numbers in the set {1, 2, ..., N, -N, -N+1, ..., -1}, and moving k steps clockwise from a vertex m would be equivalent to m + k, but considering the wrap-around. But since the numbering is not linear, it's a circle, so moving k steps from m would be m + k mod 2N, but then mapped back to the numbering.Wait, maybe it's better to assign each vertex a number from 0 to 2N-1, with vertex 1 at position 0, vertex 2 at position 1, ..., vertex N at position N-1, vertex -N at position N, vertex -N+1 at position N+1, ..., vertex -1 at position 2N-1. Then, moving k steps clockwise from position p would be (p + k) mod 2N. Similarly, moving k steps counter-clockwise would be (p - k) mod 2N.But in our problem, the movement is |ni| steps, clockwise if ni is positive, counter-clockwise if ni is negative. So, starting at position 0 (vertex 1), we move 1 step clockwise to position 1 (vertex 2). Then, from position 1, we move 2 steps clockwise to position 3 (vertex 4). Then, from position 3, we move 4 steps clockwise to position 7 (vertex 8, but if N is less than 8, this wraps around). Wait, but in the original numbering, after N comes -N, so position N is vertex -N, position N+1 is vertex -N+1, etc.Wait, maybe I should formalize this. Let me define a function that maps the vertex number to its position. Let’s say vertex k is at position (k - 1) mod 2N for k = 1, 2, ..., N, and vertex -k is at position (N + k - 1) mod 2N for k = 1, 2, ..., N. So, vertex 1 is at position 0, vertex 2 at position 1, ..., vertex N at position N-1, vertex -N at position N, vertex -N+1 at position N+1, ..., vertex -1 at position 2N-1.So, moving |ni| steps clockwise from vertex ni is equivalent to moving |ni| positions forward in the position numbering, which is (current position + |ni|) mod 2N. Similarly, moving counter-clockwise would be (current position - |ni|) mod 2N.But since ni can be positive or negative, the direction is determined by the sign of ni. So, if ni is positive, we move |ni| steps clockwise, which is (current position + |ni|) mod 2N. If ni is negative, we move |ni| steps counter-clockwise, which is (current position - |ni|) mod 2N.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said that in the i+1-th step, we mark the vertex that is |ni| vertices away from vertex ni, counting clockwise if ni is positive and counter-clockwise if ni is negative. So, starting at vertex 1, which is positive, we move 1 step clockwise to vertex 2. Then, from vertex 2, positive, move 2 steps clockwise to vertex 4. From vertex 4, positive, move 4 steps clockwise. If 4 + 4 = 8, but if 8 > N, we have to wrap around.Wait, but in terms of positions, moving 4 steps from position 3 (vertex 4) would take us to position 7, which is vertex 8 if N >=8, but if N is smaller, say N=5, then position 7 would correspond to vertex -3, because position 5 is -5, 6 is -4, 7 is -3.Wait, so perhaps the key is to model the movement as a permutation of the positions, and the marking process is following a cycle in this permutation. If f(N) = 0, that means the entire permutation is a single cycle, so the process visits all vertices before repeating. Therefore, the length of the cycle is 2N, meaning that the permutation is a single cycle of length 2N.But for the permutation to be a single cycle, certain conditions must hold. In this case, the permutation is generated by the function f(x) = x + |x| mod 2N, but with direction depending on the sign of x. Wait, no, actually, the movement is determined by the current vertex's value. So, if the current vertex is k, then the next vertex is k + |k| mod 2N, but adjusted for direction.Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a function on the positions. Let’s denote the position of vertex k as p(k). Then, moving |k| steps clockwise from k would take us to p(k) + |k| mod 2N, which corresponds to vertex m, where p(m) = (p(k) + |k|) mod 2N. Similarly, if k is negative, we move |k| steps counter-clockwise, which is p(k) - |k| mod 2N.But since p(k) is defined as (k - 1) mod 2N for positive k, and (N + k - 1) mod 2N for negative k, we can write p(k) as follows:For k > 0: p(k) = k - 1For k < 0: p(k) = N + (-k) - 1 = N - k - 1Wait, let me check that. For k = 1, p(1) = 0. For k = 2, p(2) = 1. ..., for k = N, p(N) = N - 1. For k = -N, p(-N) = N + N - 1 = 2N - 1? Wait, no, that can't be right because p(-N) should be position N. Wait, maybe I messed up the formula.Wait, let's think again. If we have 2N vertices, numbered 1, 2, ..., N, -N, -N+1, ..., -1. So, vertex 1 is at position 0, vertex 2 at position 1, ..., vertex N at position N-1. Then, vertex -N is at position N, vertex -N+1 at position N+1, ..., vertex -1 at position 2N-1.So, for a positive k, p(k) = k - 1.For a negative k, say k = -m where m is from 1 to N, then p(k) = N + m - 1. Because vertex -m is the m-th vertex after N, so starting from N, which is at position N-1, the next vertex is -N at position N, then -N+1 at N+1, ..., -1 at position 2N-1. So, for k = -m, p(k) = N + (m - 1) = N + m - 1.So, p(k) = k - 1 if k > 0, and p(k) = N + (-k) - 1 if k < 0.Now, when we move |k| steps clockwise from k, we add |k| to p(k). If k is positive, we move clockwise, so next position is p(k) + |k| mod 2N. If k is negative, we move counter-clockwise, so next position is p(k) - |k| mod 2N.But since |k| is just the absolute value, for k positive, it's k, for k negative, it's -k.So, let's formalize the next position function:If current vertex is k (positive), next position is (p(k) + k) mod 2N.If current vertex is k (negative), next position is (p(k) - (-k)) mod 2N = (p(k) + k) mod 2N.Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of whether k is positive or negative, the next position is (p(k) + |k|) mod 2N.Wait, but for negative k, p(k) = N + (-k) - 1, so p(k) + |k| = N + (-k) - 1 + (-k) = N - 2k - 1. Hmm, but that might not be the case.Wait, perhaps I should express the next position in terms of the current vertex's value.Wait, let me think differently. Let's denote the current vertex as k, which can be positive or negative. Then, the next vertex is determined by moving |k| steps in the direction determined by the sign of k.But since the movement is |k| steps, and the direction is clockwise if k is positive, counter-clockwise if k is negative, the next vertex can be expressed as:If k > 0: next vertex is (k + k) mod 2N, but considering the numbering.Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because moving k steps from vertex k, but the numbering is not linear. So, perhaps it's better to model the next vertex as follows:Given the current vertex k, which is at position p(k), moving |k| steps clockwise (if k > 0) or counter-clockwise (if k < 0) would land us at position (p(k) + |k|) mod 2N or (p(k) - |k|) mod 2N, respectively.But then, we need to map this new position back to the vertex number.So, let's define the next vertex function:If k > 0:next_position = (p(k) + k) mod 2NIf next_position < N, then next_vertex = next_position + 1Else, next_vertex = -(next_position - N + 1)If k < 0:next_position = (p(k) - (-k)) mod 2N = (p(k) + k) mod 2NSimilarly, if next_position < N, next_vertex = next_position + 1Else, next_vertex = -(next_position - N + 1)Wait, that seems a bit convoluted, but perhaps it's manageable.Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a function on the integers modulo 2N, where each step is determined by the current value.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the permutation generated by this process. If f(N) = 0, that means the permutation is a single cycle of length 2N, so the process visits all vertices before repeating. For this to happen, the step size must be such that the permutation is a single cycle, which usually requires that the step size is coprime with 2N.Wait, but in our case, the step size isn't fixed; it changes depending on the current vertex. So, it's not a simple step size. Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, perhaps we can model the movement as a function f(k) = k + k mod 2N if k is positive, and f(k) = k - (-k) mod 2N if k is negative. But that might not capture the direction correctly.Wait, let me try to write down the function more carefully.Given the current vertex k, which is either positive or negative, the next vertex is determined by moving |k| steps in the direction determined by the sign of k.So, if k is positive, we move |k| steps clockwise. Since each step is a vertex, moving |k| steps from k would land us at k + |k|, but considering the wrap-around.But wait, the vertices are arranged in a circle, so moving |k| steps from k would be equivalent to (k + |k|) mod 2N, but adjusted for the numbering.Wait, but the numbering is 1, 2, ..., N, -N, -N+1, ..., -1. So, if we move |k| steps from k, we have to consider whether we cross from positive to negative or vice versa.Wait, perhaps it's better to model the entire process as a function on the integers modulo 2N, where each step is determined by the current value.Let me try to formalize this:Let’s denote the current vertex as k, which is an integer in {1, 2, ..., N, -N, -N+1, ..., -1}.We can map each vertex k to an integer in {0, 1, ..., 2N-1} as follows:For k > 0: position(k) = k - 1For k < 0: position(k) = N + (-k) - 1So, position(k) is a bijection between the vertices and the positions 0 to 2N-1.Now, moving |k| steps clockwise from k is equivalent to adding |k| to position(k), modulo 2N.Similarly, moving |k| steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to subtracting |k| from position(k), modulo 2N.But since the direction depends on the sign of k, we have:If k > 0: next_position = (position(k) + k) mod 2NIf k < 0: next_position = (position(k) - (-k)) mod 2N = (position(k) + k) mod 2NWait, that's interesting. So, regardless of whether k is positive or negative, the next position is (position(k) + k) mod 2N.But position(k) is defined as:If k > 0: position(k) = k - 1If k < 0: position(k) = N + (-k) - 1So, let's compute next_position in both cases.Case 1: k > 0next_position = (k - 1 + k) mod 2N = (2k - 1) mod 2NCase 2: k < 0Let k = -m where m > 0position(k) = N + m - 1next_position = (N + m - 1 + (-m)) mod 2N = (N - 1) mod 2NWait, that can't be right. Because if k is negative, say k = -1, then position(k) = N + 1 - 1 = N. Then, next_position = (N + (-1)) mod 2N = N - 1. But according to the formula above, it's (N + m - 1 + (-m)) mod 2N = (N - 1) mod 2N, which is correct.Wait, but for k = -m, next_position = (N + m - 1 + (-m)) mod 2N = (N - 1) mod 2N. So, regardless of m, if k is negative, the next_position is always N - 1.Wait, that seems odd. Let me test with an example. Let N = 5.Vertices: 1,2,3,4,5,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1Positions:1:0, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, -5:5, -4:6, -3:7, -2:8, -1:9Now, starting at 1 (position 0). Since 1 is positive, next_position = (0 + 1) mod 10 = 1, which is vertex 2.From 2 (position 1), positive, next_position = (1 + 2) mod 10 = 3, which is vertex 4.From 4 (position 3), positive, next_position = (3 + 4) mod 10 = 7, which is vertex -3.From -3 (position 7), negative, so next_position = (7 + (-3)) mod 10 = (7 - 3) mod 10 = 4, which is vertex 5.From 5 (position 4), positive, next_position = (4 + 5) mod 10 = 9, which is vertex -1.From -1 (position 9), negative, next_position = (9 + (-1)) mod 10 = 8, which is vertex -2.From -2 (position 8), negative, next_position = (8 + (-2)) mod 10 = 6, which is vertex -4.From -4 (position 6), negative, next_position = (6 + (-4)) mod 10 = 2, which is vertex 3.From 3 (position 2), positive, next_position = (2 + 3) mod 10 = 5, which is vertex -5.From -5 (position 5), negative, next_position = (5 + (-5)) mod 10 = 0, which is vertex 1.So, we've returned to 1, which was already marked. So, the marked vertices are 1,2,4,-3,5,-1,-2,-4,3,-5. So, all 10 vertices are marked, so f(5) = 0.Wait, but 2N + 1 = 11, which is prime. So, that fits part (a).But let me check another example where 2N + 1 is not prime. Let's take N=4, so 2N=8, 2N+1=9, which is not prime.Vertices:1,2,3,4,-4,-3,-2,-1Positions:1:0,2:1,3:2,4:3,-4:4,-3:5,-2:6,-1:7Starting at 1 (position 0). Positive, so next_position = 0 + 1 =1 (vertex 2).From 2 (position1), positive, next_position=1+2=3 (vertex4).From4 (position3), positive, next_position=3+4=7 (vertex -1).From -1 (position7), negative, next_position=7 + (-1)=6 (vertex -2).From -2 (position6), negative, next_position=6 + (-2)=4 (vertex -4).From -4 (position4), negative, next_position=4 + (-4)=0 (vertex1).So, we've returned to 1. Marked vertices:1,2,4,-1,-2,-4. So, f(4)=8 -6=2. So, f(4)=2≠0, which is consistent with 2N+1=9 not being prime.So, in the case where 2N+1 is prime, f(N)=0, and when it's composite, f(N)≠0. So, part (a) is to prove that if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 is prime.So, perhaps the key is that when 2N+1 is prime, the permutation generated by the marking process is a single cycle of length 2N, hence f(N)=0. Conversely, if 2N+1 is composite, the permutation breaks into smaller cycles, leaving some vertices unmarked, so f(N)≠0.But how to formalize this?Wait, perhaps the process can be modeled as a permutation on the set of vertices, and the permutation is a single cycle if and only if 2N+1 is prime.Alternatively, perhaps the process is equivalent to multiplication by 2 modulo 2N+1, which is a well-known permutation that is a single cycle if and only if 2 and 2N+1 are coprime, which they are since 2N+1 is odd. But wait, 2 and 2N+1 are always coprime because 2N+1 is odd, so 2 is invertible modulo 2N+1. But that might not directly apply here.Wait, let me think again. The movement from vertex k is determined by moving |k| steps in a certain direction. But perhaps this can be modeled as a function on the integers modulo 2N+1, or something similar.Wait, another approach: consider the sequence of vertices visited. Each step, the next vertex is determined by the current vertex's value. So, starting at 1, then 2, then 4, then 8, etc., but modulo 2N. Wait, but that might not directly apply.Wait, in the example with N=5, the sequence was 1,2,4,-3,5,-1,-2,-4,3,-5, then back to 1. So, the sequence is 1,2,4,-3,5,-1,-2,-4,3,-5.Wait, let's see the positions in terms of the numbering:1:1, 2:2, 4:4, -3:7, 5:5, -1:9, -2:8, -4:6, 3:3, -5:5.Wait, no, that doesn't seem to follow a simple pattern. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence can be modeled as a linear congruential generator or something similar.Wait, perhaps the key is to note that the movement from k is equivalent to multiplying by 2 modulo (2N+1). Because in the example with N=5, 2N+1=11, which is prime. So, starting at 1, the next is 2, then 4, then 8, then 16 mod 11=5, then 10, then 20 mod11=9, then 18 mod11=7, then 14 mod11=3, then 6, then 12 mod11=1. So, the sequence is 1,2,4,5,10,9,7,3,6,1, which is similar to the marking sequence but not exactly the same.Wait, in the marking process, we had 1,2,4,-3,5,-1,-2,-4,3,-5. So, mapping these to the residues modulo 11:1:1, 2:2, 4:4, -3:8 (since -3 mod11=8), 5:5, -1:10, -2:9, -4:7, 3:3, -5:6.So, the sequence is 1,2,4,8,5,10,9,7,3,6, which is exactly the sequence generated by multiplying by 2 modulo11. So, the marking process is equivalent to multiplying by 2 modulo 2N+1, but with the vertices labeled in a certain way.Wait, that seems promising. So, if we can show that the marking process corresponds to multiplication by 2 modulo 2N+1, then the cycle length would be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1. If 2N+1 is prime, then the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1 divides 2N, and if 2 is a primitive root modulo 2N+1, then the order is 2N, which would mean the cycle covers all residues, hence all vertices are marked, so f(N)=0.But wait, in the example with N=5, 2N+1=11, which is prime, and 2 is a primitive root modulo 11 because the multiplicative order of 2 mod11 is 10, which is 2N. So, the cycle length is 10, which is 2N, so all vertices are marked.Similarly, for N=4, 2N+1=9, which is composite. The multiplicative order of 2 mod9 is 6, since 2^6=64≡1 mod9. So, the cycle length is 6, which is less than 8, so not all vertices are marked, hence f(4)=2.So, perhaps in general, the marking process corresponds to multiplication by 2 modulo 2N+1, and the cycle length is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1. Therefore, if 2N+1 is prime, and 2 is a primitive root modulo 2N+1, then the cycle length is 2N, so all vertices are marked, hence f(N)=0.But wait, not all primes have 2 as a primitive root. For example, 7 is prime, and 2^3=8≡1 mod7, so the order is 3, which is less than 6. So, if N=3, 2N+1=7, which is prime, but the order of 2 mod7 is 3, so the cycle length would be 3, hence f(3)=2N - cycle length=6-3=3.But wait, let me check N=3.Vertices:1,2,3,-3,-2,-1Positions:1:0,2:1,3:2,-3:3,-2:4,-1:5Starting at 1 (position0). Positive, so next_position=0+1=1 (vertex2).From2 (position1), positive, next_position=1+2=3 (vertex-3).From-3 (position3), negative, next_position=3 + (-3)=0 (vertex1).So, the marked vertices are 1,2,-3. Then, we return to1, so f(3)=6-3=3.But 2N+1=7 is prime, yet f(3)=3≠0. So, my earlier assumption that f(N)=0 if and only if 2N+1 is prime is incorrect, because in this case, 2N+1 is prime but f(N)≠0.Wait, that contradicts part (a), which states that if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 is prime. But in this case, f(N)=3≠0, but 2N+1=7 is prime. So, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in mapping the process to multiplication by 2 modulo 2N+1. Let me check again.In the N=5 case, the marking process corresponded to multiplication by 2 modulo11, which is prime, and the cycle length was 10, which is 2N, so f(5)=0.In the N=3 case, 2N+1=7, which is prime, but the cycle length was 3, so f(3)=3≠0.So, perhaps the condition is not just that 2N+1 is prime, but that 2 is a primitive root modulo 2N+1. So, if 2 is a primitive root modulo 2N+1, then the cycle length is 2N, hence f(N)=0. Otherwise, f(N)≠0.But part (a) only states that if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 is prime. It doesn't say the converse. So, perhaps even if 2N+1 is prime, f(N) might not be zero, but if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 must be prime.So, in the N=3 case, f(N)=3≠0, but 2N+1=7 is prime. So, the converse isn't necessarily true, but part (a) is only about the forward direction: if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 is prime.So, perhaps I need to show that if the marking process visits all vertices (f(N)=0), then 2N+1 must be prime.So, suppose that f(N)=0, meaning that the marking process visits all 2N vertices before repeating. Then, the permutation generated by the marking process is a single cycle of length 2N.Now, if 2N+1 were composite, say 2N+1=ab with a,b>1, then perhaps the cycle length would divide φ(2N+1), which is less than 2N, leading to a contradiction. Wait, but φ(2N+1) is the Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers less than 2N+1 that are coprime to it.Wait, perhaps the key is to model the marking process as a permutation whose order is 2N, which would imply that 2N divides the order of the permutation group, which is 2N!. But that might not directly help.Alternatively, perhaps the marking process can be modeled as a function f(k) = 2k mod (2N+1), but adjusted for the vertex numbering.Wait, in the N=5 case, the marking process corresponded to multiplication by 2 modulo11, which is prime, and the cycle length was 10, which is 2N. So, if 2N+1 is prime, and 2 is a primitive root modulo 2N+1, then f(N)=0.But in the N=3 case, 2N+1=7 is prime, but 2 is not a primitive root modulo7, since 2^3=8≡1 mod7, so the cycle length is 3, which is less than 6, so f(N)=3≠0.So, perhaps f(N)=0 if and only if 2 is a primitive root modulo 2N+1, which is prime. Therefore, if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 must be prime, because if 2N+1 were composite, then the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1 would be less than φ(2N+1), which is less than 2N, so the cycle length would be less than 2N, hence f(N)≠0.Wait, but in the N=3 case, 2N+1=7 is prime, but f(N)=3≠0, so the converse isn't true. So, part (a) is only about the forward direction: if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 is prime. So, I need to show that f(N)=0 implies 2N+1 is prime.So, suppose f(N)=0, meaning the marking process visits all 2N vertices. Therefore, the permutation generated by the marking process is a single cycle of length 2N. Now, if 2N+1 were composite, say 2N+1=ab with a,b>1, then perhaps the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1 would divide φ(2N+1), which is less than 2N, leading to a contradiction because the cycle length would be less than 2N, hence f(N)≠0.Wait, but in the N=3 case, 2N+1=7 is prime, yet f(N)=3≠0. So, perhaps the key is that if 2N+1 is prime, then 2 must have order 2N modulo 2N+1, which would imply that 2N divides φ(2N+1)=2N, which is true, but only if 2 is a primitive root modulo 2N+1.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.Suppose that f(N)=0, so the marking process visits all 2N vertices. Therefore, the permutation generated by the marking process is a single cycle of length 2N. Now, consider the function f(k) = 2k mod (2N+1). If 2N+1 is composite, then the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1 is less than 2N, which would mean that the cycle length is less than 2N, hence f(N)≠0. Therefore, if f(N)=0, 2N+1 must be prime.Wait, but in the N=3 case, 2N+1=7 is prime, yet f(N)=3≠0. So, that contradicts this reasoning. Therefore, perhaps the function isn't exactly multiplication by 2 modulo 2N+1, but something else.Wait, perhaps the function is f(k) = 2k mod (2N+1), but with a different mapping between the vertices and the residues.Wait, in the N=5 case, the marking process corresponded to multiplication by 2 modulo11, which is prime, and the cycle length was 10, which is 2N, so f(5)=0.In the N=3 case, 2N+1=7 is prime, but the cycle length was 3, which is less than 6, so f(3)=3≠0.So, perhaps the key is that when 2N+1 is prime, and 2 is a primitive root modulo 2N+1, then f(N)=0. Otherwise, even if 2N+1 is prime, f(N)≠0.But part (a) only states that if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 is prime. It doesn't say the converse. So, perhaps the reasoning is that if 2N+1 is composite, then the cycle length is less than 2N, hence f(N)≠0. Therefore, if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 must be prime.So, to formalize this, suppose that 2N+1 is composite, say 2N+1=ab with a,b>1. Then, the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1 divides φ(2N+1), which is less than 2N, hence the cycle length is less than 2N, so f(N)≠0. Therefore, if f(N)=0, 2N+1 must be prime.Wait, but in the N=3 case, 2N+1=7 is prime, yet f(N)=3≠0, so the converse isn't true. So, part (a) is only about the forward direction, not the converse.Therefore, the answer to part (a) is that if f(N)=0, then 2N+1 must be prime.Now, moving on to part (b): Compute f(1997).So, N=1997, which is a prime number. Wait, 1997 is a prime number. So, 2N+1=2*1997+1=3995. Wait, is 3995 prime?Wait, 3995 divided by 5 is 799, so 3995=5*799. Now, is 799 prime? Let's check. 799 divided by 17 is 47, because 17*47=799. So, 3995=5*17*47, which is composite.So, 2N+1=3995 is composite. Therefore, from part (a), since 2N+1 is composite, f(N)≠0. So, f(1997) is not zero.But we need to compute f(1997). So, perhaps we can model the marking process as multiplication by 2 modulo 3995, and find the cycle length, then f(N)=2N - cycle length.Wait, but in the earlier examples, the cycle length was the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1. So, perhaps f(N)=2N - ord_{2N+1}(2), where ord_{2N+1}(2) is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 2N+1.So, for N=1997, 2N+1=3995=5*17*47. So, we need to compute the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 3995.But since 3995 factors into primes as 5*17*47, the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 3995 is the least common multiple of the multiplicative orders of 2 modulo 5, 17, and 47.So, let's compute ord_5(2), ord_{17}(2), and ord_{47}(2).First, ord_5(2): 2^k ≡1 mod5.2^1=2 mod5≠12^2=4 mod5≠12^3=8≡3 mod5≠12^4=16≡1 mod5. So, ord_5(2)=4.Next, ord_{17}(2): 2^k ≡1 mod17.We know that 2^4=16≡-1 mod17, so 2^8≡1 mod17. So, ord_{17}(2)=8.Next, ord_{47}(2): 2^k ≡1 mod47.We need to find the smallest k such that 2^k ≡1 mod47.We know that 47 is prime, so the multiplicative order of 2 must divide 46.The factors of 46 are 1,2,23,46.Check 2^23 mod47.Compute 2^1=22^2=42^4=162^8=256≡256-5*47=256-235=212^16≡21^2=441≡441-9*47=441-423=182^23=2^16 * 2^7=18*(128 mod47)=18*(128-2*47)=18*(34)=612≡612-13*47=612-611=1 mod47.So, 2^23≡1 mod47. So, ord_{47}(2)=23.Therefore, the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 3995 is lcm(4,8,23)= lcm(8,23)=184.So, the cycle length is 184. Therefore, the number of marked vertices is 184, so f(N)=2N - cycle length=3994 - 184=3810.Wait, but wait, 2N=3994, so f(N)=3994 - 184=3810.But let me verify this with the earlier examples.In N=5, 2N+1=11, which is prime, and ord_{11}(2)=10, so f(N)=10 -10=0, which matches.In N=3, 2N+1=7, ord_7(2)=3, so f(N)=6 -3=3, which matches.In N=4, 2N+1=9=3^2, ord_9(2)=6, so f(N)=8 -6=2, which matches.So, this seems to hold.Therefore, for N=1997, f(N)=2*1997 - ord_{3995}(2)=3994 - 184=3810.Therefore, the answer to part (b) is 3810.But wait, let me double-check the multiplicative order calculations.For 5: ord_5(2)=4, correct.For 17: ord_{17}(2)=8, correct.For 47: ord_{47}(2)=23, correct.So, lcm(4,8,23)= lcm(8,23)=184, correct.Thus, f(1997)=3994 -184=3810.So, the final answer is 3810."},{"question":"The movie \\"Thirty Thousand Miles in Chang'an\\" allows the audience to experience the unique charm of Tang poetry that has been passed down for thousands of years and the beauty of traditional Chinese culture.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the distance formula: √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]. So, in this case, the distance from (0, 5/2) to any point (x, y) on the graph y = x⁴/8 would be √[(x - 0)² + (y - 5/2)²]. Since y is equal to x⁴/8, I can substitute that into the distance formula. So, the distance D would be √[x² + (x⁴/8 - 5/2)²]. Now, to find the minimum distance, I think I need to minimize this function D with respect to x. But, minimizing the square of the distance might be easier because the square root can complicate things when taking derivatives. So, let me define another function, let's call it D², which is equal to x² + (x⁴/8 - 5/2)². This should have its minimum at the same point as D, right?Alright, so now I need to find the derivative of D² with respect to x and set it equal to zero to find the critical points. Let's compute that derivative step by step. First, let me write out D² again: D² = x² + (x⁴/8 - 5/2)². Let me expand the squared term to make differentiation easier. So, (x⁴/8 - 5/2)² is equal to (x⁴/8)² - 2*(x⁴/8)*(5/2) + (5/2)². Calculating each term:- (x⁴/8)² = x⁸/64- 2*(x⁴/8)*(5/2) = 2*(5x⁴)/16 = (10x⁴)/16 = (5x⁴)/8- (5/2)² = 25/4So, putting it all together, D² = x² + x⁸/64 - (5x⁴)/8 + 25/4. Now, let's write that as D² = x⁸/64 - (5x⁴)/8 + x² + 25/4.Now, I need to find d(D²)/dx. Let's compute the derivative term by term:- The derivative of x⁸/64 is (8x⁷)/64 = x⁷/8- The derivative of -(5x⁴)/8 is - (20x³)/8 = - (5x³)/2- The derivative of x² is 2x- The derivative of 25/4 is 0So, putting it all together, d(D²)/dx = x⁷/8 - (5x³)/2 + 2x.To find the critical points, we set this derivative equal to zero:x⁷/8 - (5x³)/2 + 2x = 0Hmm, that's a seventh-degree equation. That seems complicated. Maybe I can factor out an x:x(x⁶/8 - (5x²)/2 + 2) = 0So, one solution is x = 0. Let me check what the distance is at x = 0. Plugging x = 0 into y = x⁴/8 gives y = 0. So, the point is (0, 0). The distance from (0, 5/2) to (0, 0) is √[(0 - 0)² + (0 - 5/2)²] = √[0 + 25/4] = 5/2. Hmm, that's 2.5. Is that the minimum? Maybe, but let's check the other critical points.So, the other factor is x⁶/8 - (5x²)/2 + 2 = 0. Let me set z = x², so the equation becomes z³/8 - (5z)/2 + 2 = 0. Multiplying both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:z³ - 20z + 16 = 0So, we have a cubic equation: z³ - 20z + 16 = 0. Let me try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16.Testing z = 1: 1 - 20 + 16 = -3 ≠ 0z = 2: 8 - 40 + 16 = -16 ≠ 0z = 4: 64 - 80 + 16 = 0. Oh, z = 4 is a root!So, we can factor out (z - 4) from the cubic. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.Dividing z³ - 20z + 16 by (z - 4):Using synthetic division:4 | 1  0  -20  16        4   16  -16      1  4   -4   0So, the cubic factors as (z - 4)(z² + 4z - 4) = 0.Therefore, the solutions are z = 4 and z = [-4 ± √(16 + 16)]/2 = [-4 ± √32]/2 = [-4 ± 4√2]/2 = -2 ± 2√2.Since z = x², z must be non-negative. So, z = 4 and z = -2 + 2√2. Let's compute -2 + 2√2:√2 is approximately 1.414, so 2√2 ≈ 2.828. Then, -2 + 2.828 ≈ 0.828, which is positive. So, z = 4 and z ≈ 0.828.So, the solutions for z are 4 and -2 + 2√2. Therefore, x² = 4 or x² = -2 + 2√2.Thus, x = ±2 or x = ±√(-2 + 2√2). Let me compute √(-2 + 2√2):First, compute -2 + 2√2 ≈ -2 + 2.828 ≈ 0.828, so √0.828 ≈ 0.91.So, x ≈ ±0.91. So, we have critical points at x = 0, x = ±2, and x ≈ ±0.91.Now, let's compute the distance at each of these critical points.First, x = 0: As before, the distance is 5/2 = 2.5.Next, x = 2: Let's compute y = (2)^4 /8 = 16/8 = 2. So, the point is (2, 2). The distance from (0, 5/2) is √[(2 - 0)^2 + (2 - 5/2)^2] = √[4 + ( -1/2)^2] = √[4 + 1/4] = √[17/4] ≈ √4.25 ≈ 2.0616.Similarly, x = -2: Since the function y = x⁴/8 is even, the distance will be the same as for x = 2, so also approximately 2.0616.Now, let's compute for x ≈ 0.91. Let me compute more accurately. Since z = -2 + 2√2 ≈ -2 + 2.8284 ≈ 0.8284, so x² = 0.8284, so x ≈ ±√0.8284 ≈ ±0.91.Let me compute y = x⁴ /8. So, x⁴ = (x²)^2 = (0.8284)^2 ≈ 0.686. So, y ≈ 0.686 /8 ≈ 0.08575.So, the point is approximately (0.91, 0.08575). Now, let's compute the distance from (0, 5/2) which is (0, 2.5). So, the distance is √[(0.91 - 0)^2 + (0.08575 - 2.5)^2] ≈ √[0.8281 + ( -2.41425)^2] ≈ √[0.8281 + 5.828] ≈ √[6.6561] ≈ 2.58.Wait, that's actually larger than 2.5. Hmm, that's strange. So, the distance at x ≈ 0.91 is approximately 2.58, which is larger than the distance at x=0, which is 2.5. So, that suggests that x=0 is a local minimum, but is it the global minimum?Wait, but we have another critical point at x ≈ 0.91, but the distance there is higher. So, perhaps the minimum distance is at x=0, but let me double-check.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing y. Let me compute x⁴ /8 more accurately. So, x ≈ 0.91, so x² ≈ 0.8281, then x⁴ ≈ (0.8281)^2 ≈ 0.6859, so y ≈ 0.6859 /8 ≈ 0.0857. So, that's correct.Then, the distance squared is x² + (y - 5/2)^2 ≈ 0.8281 + (0.0857 - 2.5)^2 ≈ 0.8281 + (-2.4143)^2 ≈ 0.8281 + 5.828 ≈ 6.6561, so square root is ≈ 2.58, which is indeed larger than 2.5.Wait, but that seems contradictory because when I computed the derivative, I found critical points at x=0, x=±2, and x≈±0.91. But the distance at x=0 is 2.5, at x=±2 is approximately 2.06, which is less than 2.5. So, perhaps x=0 is not the minimum, but x=±2 gives a smaller distance.Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier in thinking that x=0 is a critical point with distance 2.5, but actually, x=±2 gives a smaller distance. So, perhaps the minimum distance is approximately 2.06, which is √(17/4) = √17 / 2 ≈ 4.123 / 2 ≈ 2.0615.Wait, but let me compute the exact value. So, at x=2, the point is (2, 2). The distance squared is (2)^2 + (2 - 5/2)^2 = 4 + (-1/2)^2 = 4 + 1/4 = 17/4. So, the distance is √(17/4) = √17 / 2.Similarly, at x=-2, the point is (-2, 2), and the distance is the same.But wait, earlier, when I computed the derivative, I found critical points at x=0, x=±2, and x≈±0.91. But when I computed the distance at x≈0.91, I got a larger distance, so perhaps x=±2 are the minima.Wait, but let me check the second derivative to confirm whether these points are minima or maxima.Alternatively, maybe I can analyze the behavior of the function D².Wait, but before that, let me think about the graph of y = x⁴/8. It's a U-shaped curve that's flatter near the origin and becomes steeper as |x| increases. The point (0, 5/2) is above the origin on the y-axis. So, the closest point on the curve might be somewhere near the origin, but perhaps not exactly at x=0.Wait, but according to the critical points, x=0 is a critical point, but when I checked the distance there, it's 2.5, which is larger than the distance at x=±2, which is √17 / 2 ≈ 2.06. So, perhaps the minimum distance is at x=±2.But wait, let me check the derivative again. The derivative of D² is x⁷/8 - (5x³)/2 + 2x. At x=0, the derivative is 0, as we saw. At x=2, let's compute the derivative:x=2: (2)^7 /8 - (5*(2)^3)/2 + 2*(2) = 128/8 - (40)/2 + 4 = 16 - 20 + 4 = 0. So, that's correct, it's a critical point.Similarly, at x≈0.91, let's plug into the derivative:x≈0.91: (0.91)^7 /8 - (5*(0.91)^3)/2 + 2*(0.91). Let me compute each term:(0.91)^7 ≈ 0.91^2=0.8281, 0.91^4≈0.8281^2≈0.6859, 0.91^6≈0.6859*0.8281≈0.568, 0.91^7≈0.568*0.91≈0.518. So, 0.518 /8 ≈0.06475.Next term: (5*(0.91)^3)/2. (0.91)^3≈0.91*0.8281≈0.7535. So, 5*0.7535≈3.7675, divided by 2≈1.88375.Third term: 2*0.91≈1.82.So, total derivative ≈0.06475 -1.88375 +1.82≈0.06475 -1.88375 +1.82≈(0.06475 +1.82) -1.88375≈1.88475 -1.88375≈0.001. Hmm, that's approximately zero, which makes sense because x≈0.91 is a critical point.But when I computed the distance at x≈0.91, it was approximately 2.58, which is larger than at x=0 and x=±2. So, perhaps x=0 is a local maximum, and x=±2 are minima.Wait, but how can x=0 be a local maximum? Let me think about the behavior of D² near x=0.If I take x approaching 0 from the right, say x=0.1, then y = (0.1)^4 /8 ≈0.000125. So, the distance squared is (0.1)^2 + (0.000125 - 2.5)^2 ≈0.01 + ( -2.499875)^2≈0.01 + 6.249≈6.259. So, distance is ≈2.5018, which is slightly larger than 2.5.Similarly, at x=0, it's exactly 2.5. So, as x increases from 0, the distance squared first increases, reaches a maximum at some point, then decreases to a minimum at x≈0.91, but wait, no, earlier we saw that at x≈0.91, the distance is about 2.58, which is larger than 2.5. Hmm, that's confusing.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the critical points. Let me plot the derivative or analyze the sign changes.The derivative d(D²)/dx = x⁷/8 - (5x³)/2 + 2x.Let me factor it as x(x⁶/8 - (5x²)/2 + 2) = 0.We found the roots at x=0 and x=±2, and x≈±0.91.Now, let's analyze the sign of the derivative around these points.For x < -2: Let's pick x=-3.Compute each term:x⁷/8: (-3)^7 is negative, so negative /8 is negative.- (5x³)/2: x³ is negative, so -5x³ is positive, divided by 2 is positive.2x: negative.So, overall: negative + positive + negative. It's unclear, perhaps. Let me compute numerically:x=-3:x⁷/8 = (-2187)/8 ≈ -273.375- (5x³)/2 = - (5*(-27))/2 = - (-135)/2 = 67.52x = 2*(-3) = -6Total: -273.375 +67.5 -6 ≈ -211.875 < 0So, derivative is negative for x < -2.Between x=-2 and x≈-0.91: Let's pick x=-1.x=-1:x⁷/8 = (-1)^7 /8 = -1/8 ≈ -0.125- (5x³)/2 = - (5*(-1))/2 = 5/2 = 2.52x = 2*(-1) = -2Total: -0.125 +2.5 -2 ≈0.375 >0So, derivative is positive between x=-2 and x≈-0.91.Between x≈-0.91 and x=0: Let's pick x=-0.5.x=-0.5:x⁷/8 ≈ (-0.5)^7 /8 ≈ (-0.0078125)/8 ≈ -0.0009766- (5x³)/2 ≈ - (5*(-0.125))/2 ≈ 0.625/2 ≈0.31252x ≈2*(-0.5)= -1Total ≈ -0.0009766 +0.3125 -1 ≈-0.6885 <0So, derivative is negative between x≈-0.91 and x=0.Similarly, for x >0:Between x=0 and x≈0.91: Let's pick x=0.5.x=0.5:x⁷/8 ≈0.5^7 /8 ≈0.0078125 /8≈0.0009766- (5x³)/2 ≈- (5*(0.125))/2≈-0.625/2≈-0.31252x≈1Total≈0.0009766 -0.3125 +1≈0.6885 >0So, derivative is positive between x=0 and x≈0.91.Between x≈0.91 and x=2: Let's pick x=1.x=1:x⁷/8 =1/8≈0.125- (5x³)/2≈-5/2≈-2.52x=2Total≈0.125 -2.5 +2≈-0.375 <0So, derivative is negative between x≈0.91 and x=2.For x >2: Let's pick x=3.x=3:x⁷/8≈2187/8≈273.375- (5x³)/2≈- (5*27)/2≈-135/2≈-67.52x≈6Total≈273.375 -67.5 +6≈211.875 >0So, derivative is positive for x >2.Putting this all together, the derivative changes sign as follows:- For x < -2: negative- Between -2 and -0.91: positive- Between -0.91 and 0: negative- Between 0 and 0.91: positive- Between 0.91 and 2: negative- For x >2: positiveSo, the critical points at x=-2 and x=2 are points where the derivative changes from positive to negative (at x=-2) and from negative to positive (at x=2). Wait, actually, looking at the sign changes:At x=-2: derivative goes from negative (x < -2) to positive (between -2 and -0.91). So, x=-2 is a local minimum.At x=-0.91: derivative goes from positive to negative, so x=-0.91 is a local maximum.At x=0: derivative goes from negative (x <0) to positive (x >0), so x=0 is a local minimum.Wait, that can't be, because at x=0, the distance is 2.5, but at x=2, it's approximately 2.06, which is smaller. So, perhaps x=0 is a local minimum, but not the global minimum.Wait, but according to the sign changes, x=-2 and x=2 are points where the derivative changes from positive to negative (for x=-2) and negative to positive (for x=2). Wait, no, let me correct that.Wait, for x=-2: derivative goes from negative (x < -2) to positive (between -2 and -0.91). So, at x=-2, the function D² changes from decreasing to increasing, so x=-2 is a local minimum.Similarly, at x=-0.91: derivative goes from positive to negative, so x=-0.91 is a local maximum.At x=0: derivative goes from negative (x <0) to positive (x >0), so x=0 is a local minimum.At x=0.91: derivative goes from positive to negative, so x=0.91 is a local maximum.At x=2: derivative goes from negative (x <2) to positive (x >2), so x=2 is a local minimum.So, in terms of minima, we have local minima at x=-2, x=0, and x=2.Wait, but that's conflicting with the distances we computed earlier. Because at x=0, the distance is 2.5, at x=±2, it's √17 /2 ≈2.06, which is smaller. So, perhaps x=0 is a local minimum, but not the global minimum.Wait, but how can x=0 be a local minimum if the distance there is larger than at x=±2? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the derivative's sign changes.Wait, let me think again. The derivative d(D²)/dx is the rate of change of D² with respect to x. So, when the derivative is positive, D² is increasing, and when it's negative, D² is decreasing.So, for x < -2: derivative is negative, so D² is decreasing as x increases towards -2.At x=-2: derivative is zero, and then for x between -2 and -0.91, derivative is positive, so D² starts increasing.Similarly, at x=-0.91: derivative is zero, and then for x between -0.91 and 0, derivative is negative, so D² is decreasing.At x=0: derivative is zero, and then for x between 0 and 0.91, derivative is positive, so D² is increasing.At x=0.91: derivative is zero, and then for x between 0.91 and 2, derivative is negative, so D² is decreasing.At x=2: derivative is zero, and then for x >2, derivative is positive, so D² is increasing.So, putting this together:- For x < -2: D² decreasing towards x=-2- x=-2: local minimum- Between -2 and -0.91: D² increasing- x=-0.91: local maximum- Between -0.91 and 0: D² decreasing towards x=0- x=0: local minimum- Between 0 and 0.91: D² increasing- x=0.91: local maximum- Between 0.91 and 2: D² decreasing towards x=2- x=2: local minimum- For x >2: D² increasingSo, in terms of minima, we have local minima at x=-2, x=0, and x=2.But when we compute the distances:- At x=-2 and x=2: distance ≈2.06- At x=0: distance=2.5So, x=0 is a local minimum, but it's higher than the minima at x=±2. So, the global minima are at x=±2, with distance √17 /2.Wait, but let me check another point beyond x=2, say x=3. The distance squared would be 3² + (3⁴/8 - 5/2)^2 =9 + (81/8 - 5/2)^2. 81/8 is 10.125, 5/2 is 2.5, so 10.125 -2.5=7.625. So, (7.625)^2≈58.14, so distance squared≈9 +58.14≈67.14, distance≈8.195, which is much larger.Similarly, as x approaches infinity, y =x⁴/8 goes to infinity, so the distance will also go to infinity. So, the function D² has minima at x=±2, which are lower than the local minimum at x=0.Therefore, the minimum distance is √17 /2, achieved at x=±2.Wait, but let me confirm by checking another point near x=2, say x=1.9.Compute y = (1.9)^4 /8 ≈ (13.0321)/8≈1.629. Then, distance squared is (1.9)^2 + (1.629 -2.5)^2≈3.61 + (-0.871)^2≈3.61 +0.758≈4.368, so distance≈2.09, which is larger than √17 /2≈2.06.Similarly, at x=2.1, y=(2.1)^4 /8≈(19.4481)/8≈2.431. Distance squared≈(2.1)^2 + (2.431 -2.5)^2≈4.41 + (-0.069)^2≈4.41 +0.00476≈4.41476, distance≈2.101, which is again larger than √17 /2.So, it seems that x=±2 indeed give the minimal distance.Wait, but earlier, when I computed the distance at x≈0.91, I got approximately 2.58, which is larger than 2.5, which is the distance at x=0. So, x=0 is a local minimum, but not the global minimum.Therefore, the minimal distance is √17 /2, achieved at x=±2.Wait, but let me make sure that there's no other critical point with a smaller distance. We found critical points at x=0, x=±2, and x≈±0.91. We saw that x=±2 give the smallest distance, so that's the answer.Alternatively, maybe I can use calculus to confirm that x=±2 are the points of minima.Wait, let me compute the second derivative at x=2 to check concavity.First, the first derivative is d(D²)/dx = x⁷/8 - (5x³)/2 + 2x.The second derivative is d²(D²)/dx² = (7x⁶)/8 - (15x²)/2 + 2.At x=2:(7*(2)^6)/8 - (15*(2)^2)/2 + 2 = (7*64)/8 - (15*4)/2 + 2 = (448)/8 - 60/2 + 2 = 56 -30 +2 =28.Since the second derivative is positive at x=2, the function D² is concave upward there, confirming that x=2 is a local minimum.Similarly, at x=0:Second derivative at x=0 is 0 -0 +2=2>0, so x=0 is also a local minimum, but as we saw, it's higher than the minima at x=±2.Therefore, the minimal distance is √17 /2, achieved at x=±2.Wait, but let me just confirm by plugging x=2 back into the original distance formula.Point on the curve: (2, 2). Distance from (0, 5/2):√[(2 -0)^2 + (2 - 2.5)^2] =√[4 + (-0.5)^2] =√[4 +0.25] =√4.25=√(17/4)=√17 /2≈2.0616.Yes, that's correct.So, after all this, I think the minimal distance is √17 /2.**Final Answer**The minimum distance is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{17}}{2}}."},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow{m}=(1,2) and overrightarrow{n}=(a,-1), if overrightarrow{m} perp overrightarrow{n}, find the value of the real number a.","answer":"To determine the value of ( a ) that makes the vectors ( overrightarrow{m} = (1, 2) ) and ( overrightarrow{n} = (a, -1) ) perpendicular, I start by recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero.The dot product of ( overrightarrow{m} ) and ( overrightarrow{n} ) is calculated as:[overrightarrow{m} cdot overrightarrow{n} = (1)(a) + (2)(-1) = a - 2]Setting this equal to zero for perpendicularity:[a - 2 = 0]Solving for ( a ) gives:[a = 2]"},{"question":"How many two-digit numbers have at least one digit that is smaller than the corresponding digit in the number 35?For example, the numbers 17 and 21 qualify, whereas the numbers 36 and 48 do not.","answer":"To determine how many two-digit numbers have at least one digit smaller than the corresponding digit in 35, I'll break down the problem by analyzing each digit position separately.First, I'll consider the tens place.

Six people randomly seat themselves in the chairs. Each person randomly chooses either to set their feet on the floor, to cross their legs to the right, or to cross their legs to the left.  There is only a problem if two people sitting next to each other have the person on the right crossing their legs to the left and the person on the left crossing their legs to the right.  The probability that this will **not** happen is given by  frac{m}{n}  where  m  and  n  are relatively prime positive integers. Find  m+n .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where six chairs are in a row, and six people randomly sit down. Each person then randomly chooses one of three options: sit with feet on the floor, cross their legs to the right, or cross their legs to the left. The problem arises if two people sitting next to each other have the person on the right crossing their legs to the left and the person on the left crossing their legs to the right. We need to find the probability that this problematic situation does **not** happen, and express it as a reduced fraction (frac{m}{n}), then find (m + n).Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, the seating arrangement is random. So, six people can sit in any order, which is (6!) ways. But since each person independently chooses their leg position, the total number of possible scenarios is (6! times 3^6). However, since the seating arrangement is random, maybe we can consider it as a permutation, but perhaps the leg positions are independent of the seating. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as two separate processes: seating and leg crossing.But wait, the problem is about adjacent people having a specific leg crossing combination. So, regardless of who sits where, the key is the leg positions of adjacent people. Therefore, maybe the seating arrangement doesn't affect the probability because each person is equally likely to sit anywhere, and their leg positions are independent. So perhaps the seating arrangement is just a distraction, and we can focus on the leg positions.Wait, no, actually, the seating is random, so the permutation of people doesn't affect the leg crossing choices because each person chooses independently. So the probability might just depend on the leg crossing choices, regardless of who is sitting where. So maybe we can model this as a sequence of six people, each with three choices, and we need to count the number of sequences where no two adjacent people have the left person crossing right and the right person crossing left.Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of length 6 where each element is one of three states: floor (F), right cross (R), or left cross (L), and we don't have the substring \\"RL\\" anywhere in the sequence. Then, the total number of sequences is (3^6), and the number of valid sequences is the number we need to compute.So, the probability we want is (frac{text{Number of valid sequences}}{3^6}).So, now, the problem is similar to counting the number of ternary strings of length 6 without the substring \\"RL\\". Hmm, this seems like a problem that can be approached using recursion or dynamic programming.Let me think about how to model this. Let's denote (a_n) as the number of valid sequences of length (n) ending with F, (b_n) as ending with R, and (c_n) as ending with L. Then, the total number of valid sequences of length (n) is (a_n + b_n + c_n).Now, we need to find recurrence relations for (a_n), (b_n), and (c_n).First, for (a_n): If a sequence ends with F, the previous character can be anything, because F doesn't impose any restrictions. So, (a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}).Similarly, for (b_n): If a sequence ends with R, the previous character can be F or R, but not L, because if the previous character was L, then we would have \\"LR\\", which is not the problematic substring. Wait, actually, the problematic substring is \\"RL\\", so having \\"LR\\" is fine. So, actually, the only restriction is that we cannot have \\"RL\\". So, if a sequence ends with R, the previous character can be F, R, or L, except that if the previous character was L, then we would have \\"LR\\", which is okay. Wait, no, the problematic substring is \\"RL\\", so if we have R at position (n), the previous character at position (n-1) can be anything except L? Wait, no, because \\"RL\\" is problematic, so if the previous character is R, then we have \\"RR\\", which is fine. If the previous character is F, we have \\"FR\\", which is fine. If the previous character is L, we have \\"LR\\", which is fine. So, actually, (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}). Wait, that can't be, because that would imply (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}), which is the same as (a_n). That seems incorrect because if we have a sequence ending with R, the previous can be anything, but actually, no, because \\"RL\\" is the problematic substring. So, if the previous character is L, then we have \\"RL\\", which is bad. So, actually, if we are ending with R, the previous character cannot be L. Therefore, (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}), because the previous character can be F or R, but not L.Similarly, for (c_n): If a sequence ends with L, the previous character can be F or L, but not R, because if the previous character was R, then we have \\"RL\\", which is problematic. So, (c_n = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}).So, to summarize:- (a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1})- (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})- (c_n = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1})Now, we need initial conditions. For (n = 1), each sequence of length 1 can end with F, R, or L, so:- (a_1 = 1)- (b_1 = 1)- (c_1 = 1)So, the total number of sequences for (n=1) is 3, which is correct.Let me compute these step by step up to (n=6).For (n=1):- (a_1 = 1)- (b_1 = 1)- (c_1 = 1)- Total: 3For (n=2):- (a_2 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3)- (b_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2)- (c_2 = a_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 = 2)- Total: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7For (n=3):- (a_3 = a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7)- (b_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 3 + 2 = 5)- (c_3 = a_2 + c_2 = 3 + 2 = 5)- Total: 7 + 5 + 5 = 17For (n=4):- (a_4 = a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 7 + 5 + 5 = 17)- (b_4 = a_3 + b_3 = 7 + 5 = 12)- (c_4 = a_3 + c_3 = 7 + 5 = 12)- Total: 17 + 12 + 12 = 41For (n=5):- (a_5 = a_4 + b_4 + c_4 = 17 + 12 + 12 = 41)- (b_5 = a_4 + b_4 = 17 + 12 = 29)- (c_5 = a_4 + c_4 = 17 + 12 = 29)- Total: 41 + 29 + 29 = 99For (n=6):- (a_6 = a_5 + b_5 + c_5 = 41 + 29 + 29 = 99)- (b_6 = a_5 + b_5 = 41 + 29 = 70)- (c_6 = a_5 + c_5 = 41 + 29 = 70)- Total: 99 + 70 + 70 = 239So, the total number of valid sequences is 239.Wait, but hold on, the total number of sequences is (3^6 = 729). So, the probability is (frac{239}{729}).But wait, let me check my calculations again because 239 seems a bit low. Let me recount the steps:Starting with (n=1):- (a_1 = 1), (b_1 = 1), (c_1 = 1), total = 3.(n=2):- (a_2 = 3), (b_2 = 2), (c_2 = 2), total = 7.(n=3):- (a_3 = 7), (b_3 = 5), (c_3 = 5), total = 17.(n=4):- (a_4 = 17), (b_4 = 12), (c_4 = 12), total = 41.(n=5):- (a_5 = 41), (b_5 = 29), (c_5 = 29), total = 99.(n=6):- (a_6 = 99), (b_6 = 70), (c_6 = 70), total = 239.Yes, that seems consistent. So, 239 valid sequences.Therefore, the probability is (frac{239}{729}).But wait, is 239 and 729 relatively prime? Let's check.729 divided by 239: 239*3=717, 729-717=12. So, 729 = 239*3 + 12.Then, 239 divided by 12: 12*19=228, 239-228=11.12 divided by 11: 11*1=11, remainder 1.11 divided by 1: remainder 0. So, GCD is 1. Therefore, 239 and 729 are coprime.Thus, the probability is (frac{239}{729}), so (m = 239), (n = 729), and (m + n = 239 + 729 = 968).Wait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake in the recurrence relations. Let me double-check.The problem is that we cannot have \\"RL\\" as a substring. So, when building the sequence, if the previous character is R, the next character cannot be L. So, when considering (c_n) (ending with L), the previous character cannot be R. So, (c_n = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}), which is correct because the previous can be F or L.Similarly, when building (b_n) (ending with R), the previous character can be F or R, but not L, because if the previous was L, then we would have \\"LR\\", which is allowed. Wait, no, the problematic substring is \\"RL\\", so having \\"LR\\" is fine. So, actually, if we end with R, the previous can be F, R, or L, except that if the previous was L, we have \\"LR\\", which is okay. So, why did I think (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})?Wait, no, actually, if we have a sequence ending with R, the only restriction is that the previous character cannot be L, because \\"RL\\" is bad. Wait, no, \\"RL\\" is bad, so if we have R at position (n), the previous character at (n-1) can be anything except L? No, wait, if the previous character is L, then we have \\"RL\\", which is bad. So, actually, if we are ending with R, the previous character cannot be L. Therefore, (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}), because the previous can be F or R, but not L.Similarly, if we are ending with L, the previous character cannot be R, because \\"RL\\" is bad. So, (c_n = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}), because the previous can be F or L, but not R.Wait, that makes sense. So, the recurrence relations are correct.Therefore, the calculations are correct, leading to 239 valid sequences.But, just to be thorough, let me think of another way to model this.Alternatively, we can model this as a finite automaton where the states represent the last action. The states are:- State F: last action was F- State R: last action was R- State L: last action was LBut with the constraint that we cannot have \\"RL\\". So, transitions:From F:- Can go to F, R, or L.From R:- Can go to F, R, but not L (since R followed by L is bad).From L:- Can go to F, L, but not R (since L followed by R would create \\"LR\\", which is allowed, but wait, no, the problematic is \\"RL\\", not \\"LR\\". So, actually, from L, we can go to R, because \\"LR\\" is fine. Wait, no, the problem is only \\"RL\\", so \\"LR\\" is allowed. So, from L, we can go to F, R, or L.Wait, hold on, this is conflicting with my previous reasoning.Wait, if the problematic substring is \\"RL\\", then \\"LR\\" is allowed. So, from L, we can go to R without any problem. So, actually, the only forbidden transition is from R to L.Therefore, the states and transitions are:- From F: can go to F, R, L- From R: can go to F, R, but not L- From L: can go to F, R, LTherefore, the number of valid sequences can be modeled with these transitions.So, let me model this as a state machine:Define:- (F_n): number of sequences of length (n) ending with F- (R_n): number of sequences of length (n) ending with R- (L_n): number of sequences of length (n) ending with LThen, the recurrence relations are:- (F_n = F_{n-1} + R_{n-1} + L_{n-1})- (R_n = F_{n-1} + R_{n-1})- (L_n = F_{n-1} + R_{n-1} + L_{n-1})Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, in this case, from L, you can go to F, R, or L, so (L_n = F_{n-1} + R_{n-1} + L_{n-1}). Similarly, from R, you can go to F or R, so (R_n = F_{n-1} + R_{n-1}). From F, you can go to F, R, or L, so (F_n = F_{n-1} + R_{n-1} + L_{n-1}).Wait, but that seems different from my initial recurrence. Wait, in my initial recurrence, I had:- (a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1})- (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})- (c_n = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1})Which is the same as this.So, in this case, (F_n = a_n), (R_n = b_n), (L_n = c_n). So, the recurrence is consistent.Therefore, the previous calculations hold.Thus, the number of valid sequences is 239, total sequences is 729, so the probability is (frac{239}{729}), which simplifies to itself since GCD(239,729)=1. Therefore, (m + n = 239 + 729 = 968).Wait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe using inclusion-exclusion. Let me see if I can compute the number of sequences without \\"RL\\" using inclusion-exclusion.The total number of sequences is (3^6 = 729).The number of sequences that have at least one \\"RL\\" substring. We need to subtract these from the total.But inclusion-exclusion can get complicated because overlapping substrings can occur.Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation method, which gave 239, so the probability is (frac{239}{729}).But just to be thorough, let me compute the number of sequences with at least one \\"RL\\" and see if 729 - 239 = 490 is equal to the number of sequences with at least one \\"RL\\".Alternatively, let me compute the number of sequences with at least one \\"RL\\" using inclusion-exclusion.First, the number of positions where \\"RL\\" can occur. In a sequence of 6, there are 5 adjacent pairs: positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6.Let (A_i) be the set of sequences where the (i)-th and ((i+1))-th positions form \\"RL\\".We need to compute (|A_1 cup A_2 cup A_3 cup A_4 cup A_5|).By inclusion-exclusion:(|A_1 cup dots cup A_5| = sum |A_i| - sum |A_i cap A_j| + sum |A_i cap A_j cap A_k| - dots + (-1)^{m+1} |A_1 cap dots cap A_m|).First, compute (|A_i|): For each (A_i), the pair at positions (i) and (i+1) is \\"RL\\". The rest of the 4 positions can be anything, so each has 3 choices. So, (|A_i| = 3^{4} = 81). There are 5 such (A_i), so the first term is (5 times 81 = 405).Next, compute (|A_i cap A_j|): This depends on whether (i) and (j) are adjacent or not.Case 1: (j = i + 1). Then, (A_i cap A_j) requires that positions (i, i+1, i+2) form \\"RLR\\". Because (A_i) requires positions (i, i+1) as \\"RL\\", and (A_j) requires positions (i+1, i+2) as \\"RL\\". So, the overlapping position (i+1) must be both \\"L\\" (from (A_i)) and \\"R\\" (from (A_j)), which is impossible. Therefore, (|A_i cap A_j| = 0) when (j = i + 1).Case 2: (j neq i + 1). Then, the two pairs don't overlap, so the number of sequences is (3^{6 - 4} = 3^{2} = 9). Because we fix two non-overlapping pairs as \\"RL\\", and the remaining 2 positions can be anything.How many such pairs (i, j) are there where (j neq i + 1)? For each (i), the number of (j) such that (j neq i + 1) is 4. Since there are 5 (A_i), the total number of non-overlapping pairs is (5 times 4 / 2 = 10). Wait, no, actually, the number of unordered pairs is (C(5, 2) = 10). Out of these, how many are adjacent? For 5 elements, the number of adjacent pairs is 4 (since 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5). So, the number of non-adjacent pairs is 10 - 4 = 6.Each non-adjacent pair contributes (3^{2} = 9) sequences. So, the total for (|A_i cap A_j|) is (6 times 9 = 54).Thus, the second term in inclusion-exclusion is (-54).Now, moving on to the third term: (|A_i cap A_j cap A_k|). Again, this depends on the positions.Case 1: All three (A_i, A_j, A_k) are non-overlapping. Then, the number of sequences is (3^{6 - 6} = 1), since we fix three non-overlapping pairs as \\"RL\\". But in 6 positions, we can have at most two non-overlapping \\"RL\\" pairs, because each \\"RL\\" takes two positions. So, three non-overlapping pairs would require 6 positions, but since we have 5 pairs, it's impossible to have three non-overlapping \\"RL\\" pairs. Therefore, (|A_i cap A_j cap A_k| = 0) for three non-overlapping pairs.Case 2: Some overlapping. For example, two overlapping and one separate. But in reality, since \\"RL\\" is two characters, overlapping would require that the second \\"RL\\" starts at position (i+1), but as we saw before, overlapping \\"RL\\" pairs lead to a contradiction because position (i+1) must be both \\"L\\" and \\"R\\".Therefore, any intersection of three (A_i)s would require at least two overlapping \\"RL\\" pairs, which is impossible. Therefore, all (|A_i cap A_j cap A_k| = 0).Similarly, higher-order intersections are also zero.Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion formula stops at the second term.Thus, the total number of sequences with at least one \\"RL\\" is (405 - 54 = 351).Therefore, the number of sequences without any \\"RL\\" is (729 - 351 = 378).Wait, hold on, that's conflicting with my earlier result of 239. So, which one is correct?Wait, this is concerning. The inclusion-exclusion method gave me 378, while the recurrence method gave me 239. There must be a mistake somewhere.Wait, let's check the inclusion-exclusion calculations again.First, (|A_i| = 81) for each of the 5 pairs, so total first term is 405.Then, for the intersections (|A_i cap A_j|):- If (i) and (j) are adjacent, then (|A_i cap A_j| = 0), as previously established.- If (i) and (j) are non-adjacent, then (|A_i cap A_j| = 3^{6 - 4} = 9). How many such pairs? As above, 6.So, total second term is (6 times 9 = 54). So, inclusion-exclusion gives (405 - 54 = 351).But wait, is that correct? Because in inclusion-exclusion, the second term is the sum over all pairs (|A_i cap A_j|), which is 54, but since it's subtracted, it's -54.But wait, the inclusion-exclusion formula is:(|A_1 cup dots cup A_5| = sum |A_i| - sum |A_i cap A_j| + sum |A_i cap A_j cap A_k| - dots)So, it's 405 - 54 + 0 - 0 + ... = 351.Therefore, the number of sequences with at least one \\"RL\\" is 351, so the number without any \\"RL\\" is 729 - 351 = 378.But this contradicts the recurrence result of 239.Wait, so which one is correct?Alternatively, maybe my inclusion-exclusion is wrong because when two \\"RL\\"s are non-overlapping, the number of fixed positions is 4, so the remaining 2 positions are free, so (3^2 = 9), which is correct. But is that all?Wait, no, actually, when we have two non-overlapping \\"RL\\"s, the number of sequences is 9, but in reality, the two \\"RL\\"s are fixed, and the other positions can be anything, so yes, 9.But wait, in the inclusion-exclusion, the second term subtracts all the overlaps, but in reality, when you have two \\"RL\\"s, they might interfere with each other in more complex ways.Wait, no, actually, in inclusion-exclusion, the second term subtracts all the pairwise intersections, which in this case are either 0 or 9. So, the calculation seems correct.But then why does the recurrence method give a different answer?Wait, let me check the recurrence again.Wait, in the recurrence, I considered (a_n), (b_n), (c_n) as ending with F, R, L respectively, with the constraint that \\"RL\\" is forbidden.But in the inclusion-exclusion, I considered the total number of sequences without \\"RL\\" as 378.But 378 is not equal to 239, so one of the methods must be wrong.Wait, let me compute the number for a smaller n, say n=2.For n=2, total sequences: 9.Number of sequences without \\"RL\\": all except \\"RL\\", which is 1. So, 8.But according to the recurrence:At n=2:- (a_2 = 3), (b_2 = 2), (c_2 = 2), total = 7.Wait, but according to inclusion-exclusion, the number should be 8.So, discrepancy here.Wait, so which one is correct?Wait, for n=2, the forbidden sequence is \\"RL\\", so the number of allowed sequences is 9 - 1 = 8.But according to the recurrence, it's 7. So, the recurrence is wrong.Wait, that must mean that my recurrence is incorrect.Wait, why?Looking back, for n=2:- (a_2 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3)- (b_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2)- (c_2 = a_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 = 2)- Total: 7But the actual number is 8.So, the recurrence is undercounting.Therefore, my initial recurrence is wrong.Wait, why?Because when I defined (b_n) as sequences ending with R, and (c_n) as sequences ending with L, but in reality, the forbidden substring is \\"RL\\", so the only restriction is that after an R, you cannot have an L.But in the recurrence, I considered that (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}), because after R, you can't have L. But actually, when building (b_n), you can have any sequence ending with F or R, and then append R.Similarly, for (c_n), you can have any sequence ending with F or L, and then append L.But wait, in that case, the recurrence is correct, but why does it undercount for n=2?Wait, for n=2, the forbidden sequence is \\"RL\\", which is one sequence. So, total allowed is 8.But according to the recurrence, it's 7. So, the recurrence is wrong.Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the recurrence, I'm not considering that after an L, you can have an R, but in the forbidden substring, \\"RL\\" is forbidden, but \\"LR\\" is allowed.Wait, but in the recurrence, (c_n = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}), meaning that after L, you can only append F or L, but actually, you can append R as well, because \\"LR\\" is allowed.Wait, hold on, that's the mistake.Because the forbidden substring is \\"RL\\", so after an R, you cannot have an L. But after an L, you can have anything, including R.Therefore, in the recurrence, (c_n) should be (a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}), because after an L, you can append F, R, or L.Similarly, (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}), because after an R, you cannot append L.Wait, so my initial recurrence was wrong.I think I confused the constraints.Let me re-examine.The forbidden substring is \\"RL\\", so:- After an R, you cannot have an L.- After an L, you can have anything (F, R, L).Therefore, the recurrence should be:- (a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}) (since after F, you can have anything)- (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) (after R, you can have F or R, but not L)- (c_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}) (after L, you can have anything)Wait, that's different from before. So, in my initial recurrence, I had (c_n = a_{n-1} + c_{n-1}), which was incorrect. It should be (c_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}).Similarly, (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}).Therefore, my initial recurrence was wrong because I restricted (c_n) incorrectly.Therefore, let's redefine the recurrence:- (a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1})- (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})- (c_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1})With initial conditions:- (a_1 = 1), (b_1 = 1), (c_1 = 1)Let me recalculate the values with this corrected recurrence.For (n=1):- (a_1 = 1)- (b_1 = 1)- (c_1 = 1)- Total: 3For (n=2):- (a_2 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3)- (b_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2)- (c_2 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3)- Total: 3 + 2 + 3 = 8Which matches the inclusion-exclusion result for (n=2). Good.For (n=3):- (a_3 = a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 3 + 2 + 3 = 8)- (b_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 3 + 2 = 5)- (c_3 = a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 3 + 2 + 3 = 8)- Total: 8 + 5 + 8 = 21For (n=4):- (a_4 = a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 8 + 5 + 8 = 21)- (b_4 = a_3 + b_3 = 8 + 5 = 13)- (c_4 = a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 8 + 5 + 8 = 21)- Total: 21 + 13 + 21 = 55For (n=5):- (a_5 = a_4 + b_4 + c_4 = 21 + 13 + 21 = 55)- (b_5 = a_4 + b_4 = 21 + 13 = 34)- (c_5 = a_4 + b_4 + c_4 = 21 + 13 + 21 = 55)- Total: 55 + 34 + 55 = 144For (n=6):- (a_6 = a_5 + b_5 + c_5 = 55 + 34 + 55 = 144)- (b_6 = a_5 + b_5 = 55 + 34 = 89)- (c_6 = a_5 + b_5 + c_5 = 55 + 34 + 55 = 144)- Total: 144 + 89 + 144 = 377Wait, so the total number of valid sequences is 377.But according to inclusion-exclusion, it was 378. Hmm, close but not the same. Wait, 377 vs 378.Wait, let me check the inclusion-exclusion again.Wait, for (n=6), total sequences: 729.Number of sequences with at least one \\"RL\\": 351.Therefore, number without \\"RL\\": 729 - 351 = 378.But according to the corrected recurrence, it's 377.Hmm, discrepancy of 1.Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion is wrong because when subtracting overlaps, maybe we missed something.Wait, let me recalculate the inclusion-exclusion for (n=6).First, (|A_i| = 81) for each of the 5 positions, so 5*81=405.Next, (|A_i cap A_j|):- If (i) and (j) are adjacent, (|A_i cap A_j| = 0).- If (i) and (j) are non-adjacent, (|A_i cap A_j| = 9).Number of non-adjacent pairs: C(5,2) - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6.So, total intersections: 6*9=54.Thus, inclusion-exclusion gives 405 - 54 = 351.Therefore, the number without \\"RL\\" is 729 - 351 = 378.But according to the corrected recurrence, it's 377.Hmm, so which one is correct?Wait, let me manually compute for (n=3).For (n=3), total sequences: 27.Forbidden sequences are those containing \\"RL\\".How many sequences have \\"RL\\"?Possible positions for \\"RL\\":- Positions 1-2: Then, the third position can be anything: 3 sequences.- Positions 2-3: Then, the first position can be anything: 3 sequences.But the sequence \\"RLR\\" is counted twice, so total forbidden sequences: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.Therefore, allowed sequences: 27 - 5 = 22.But according to the recurrence, for (n=3), total is 21.Hmm, discrepancy again.Wait, so inclusion-exclusion gives 22, recurrence gives 21.Wait, so perhaps inclusion-exclusion is correct, and the recurrence is wrong.Wait, but for (n=2), the recurrence was correct after correction.Wait, let me think again.Wait, for (n=3), the forbidden sequences are those containing \\"RL\\" as a substring.So, sequences like \\"RLF\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\", \\"FRL\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\".Wait, no, in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are:- \\"RLF\\": positions 1-2 are \\"RL\\"- \\"RLR\\": positions 1-2 are \\"RL\\"- \\"RLC\\": positions 1-2 are \\"RL\\"- \\"FRL\\": positions 2-3 are \\"RL\\"- \\"RLR\\": positions 2-3 are \\"RL\\" (but already counted)- \\"RLC\\": positions 2-3 are \\"RL\\" (already counted)Wait, so actually, the forbidden sequences are:- \\"RLF\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\", \\"FRL\\"So, total 4 forbidden sequences.Therefore, allowed sequences: 27 - 4 = 23.But according to inclusion-exclusion, it was 22, and according to recurrence, 21.Wait, now I'm confused.Wait, let me list all forbidden sequences for (n=3):1. \\"RLF\\"2. \\"RLR\\"3. \\"RLC\\"4. \\"FRL\\"5. \\"LRL\\" (Wait, is \\"LRL\\" forbidden? It contains \\"RL\\" starting at position 2.Yes, \\"LRL\\" has \\"RL\\" at positions 2-3.So, \\"LRL\\" is forbidden.Similarly, \\"RRL\\" is forbidden because it has \\"RL\\" at positions 2-3.Wait, no, \\"RRL\\" is \\"R\\", \\"R\\", \\"L\\". It has \\"RL\\" at positions 2-3.So, \\"RRL\\" is forbidden.Similarly, \\"RLR\\" is forbidden because it has \\"RL\\" at positions 1-2 and 2-3.Wait, so forbidden sequences are:1. \\"RLF\\"2. \\"RLR\\"3. \\"RLC\\"4. \\"FRL\\"5. \\"LRL\\"6. \\"RRL\\"So, total 6 forbidden sequences.Therefore, allowed sequences: 27 - 6 = 21.Which matches the recurrence result.But inclusion-exclusion gave 22. So, inclusion-exclusion was wrong.Wait, why?Because in inclusion-exclusion, for (n=3), the number of forbidden sequences is:- (|A_1| = 3) (positions 1-2 as \\"RL\\", third position free)- (|A_2| = 3) (positions 2-3 as \\"RL\\", first position free)- (|A_1 cap A_2| = 1) (sequence \\"RLR\\")So, total forbidden sequences: (|A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 cap A_2| = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5).But actually, we have 6 forbidden sequences, so inclusion-exclusion is undercounting.Wait, that's because in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are \\"RLF\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\", \\"FRL\\", \\"LRL\\", \\"RRL\\". So, 6 sequences.But according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 5.So, inclusion-exclusion is missing one.Wait, why?Because in inclusion-exclusion, we considered only two sets (A_1) and (A_2), but in reality, for (n=3), the forbidden substrings can be in positions 1-2 or 2-3, but when both are forbidden, their intersection is only \\"RLR\\".But in reality, the forbidden sequences are:- From (A_1): \\"RLF\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\"- From (A_2): \\"FRL\\", \\"LRL\\", \\"RRL\\"So, total 6 sequences, but inclusion-exclusion counts 3 + 3 - 1 = 5, missing one.Wait, that's because in inclusion-exclusion, we have (|A_1 cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 cap A_2|). So, 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. But in reality, (A_1) and (A_2) are overlapping in \\"RLR\\", so the total forbidden sequences are 5, but in reality, we have 6 forbidden sequences.Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, \\"RLR\\" is the only overlapping sequence, so the total forbidden sequences should be 3 + 3 - 1 = 5, but in reality, we have 6 forbidden sequences.Wait, that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are 5, not 6.Wait, let me list them:1. \\"RLF\\"2. \\"RLR\\"3. \\"RLC\\"4. \\"FRL\\"5. \\"LRL\\"6. \\"RRL\\"Wait, so 6 forbidden sequences.But according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 5. So, why is that?Because in inclusion-exclusion, (|A_1 cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 cap A_2| = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5). But in reality, we have 6 forbidden sequences. So, inclusion-exclusion is undercounting by 1.Wait, that suggests that inclusion-exclusion is not accounting for some forbidden sequences.Wait, no, actually, in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are exactly those in (A_1) or (A_2). So, (A_1) has 3 sequences, (A_2) has 3 sequences, and their intersection is 1 sequence. So, total forbidden sequences are 5, not 6. So, why do I think there are 6?Wait, let me list them:From (A_1):1. \\"RLF\\"2. \\"RLR\\"3. \\"RLC\\"From (A_2):4. \\"FRL\\"5. \\"LRL\\"6. \\"RRL\\"Wait, but \\"RRL\\" is in (A_2), but does \\"RRL\\" contain \\"RL\\"? Yes, at positions 2-3.But in (A_2), we fix positions 2-3 as \\"RL\\", so the first position can be anything. So, \\"RRL\\" is in (A_2), as the first position is \\"R\\".Similarly, \\"FRL\\" is in (A_2), with first position \\"F\\".\\"LRL\\" is in (A_2), with first position \\"L\\".So, indeed, (A_2) has 3 sequences: \\"FRL\\", \\"LRL\\", \\"RRL\\".Similarly, (A_1) has 3 sequences: \\"RLF\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\".Their intersection is \\"RLR\\", which is in both (A_1) and (A_2).Therefore, total forbidden sequences: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.But when I list them, I get 6. So, which one is wrong?Wait, no, \\"RLR\\" is in both (A_1) and (A_2), so when we list them, it's:From (A_1): \\"RLF\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\"From (A_2): \\"FRL\\", \\"LRL\\", \\"RRL\\"So, total unique forbidden sequences: 6.But according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 5. So, why?Because in inclusion-exclusion, we have:(|A_1 cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 cap A_2| = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5)But in reality, the union is 6. So, that suggests that inclusion-exclusion is wrong, which can't be.Wait, no, actually, in reality, \\"RLR\\" is the only overlapping sequence, so the total forbidden sequences should be 5, not 6. But when I list them, I see 6. So, perhaps I'm overcounting.Wait, \\"RLR\\" is the same as \\"RLR\\", so it's only one sequence. So, the forbidden sequences are:1. \\"RLF\\"2. \\"RLR\\"3. \\"RLC\\"4. \\"FRL\\"5. \\"LRL\\"6. \\"RRL\\"Wait, that's 6 sequences. So, inclusion-exclusion is undercounting by 1.Wait, that suggests that my inclusion-exclusion approach is flawed.Alternatively, perhaps my understanding of the forbidden sequences is wrong.Wait, no, the forbidden substring is \\"RL\\", so any occurrence of \\"RL\\" in the sequence makes it forbidden. So, in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are those that have \\"RL\\" starting at position 1 or 2.Therefore, the forbidden sequences are:- Starting at 1: \\"RLF\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\"- Starting at 2: \\"FRL\\", \\"LRL\\", \\"RRL\\"So, 6 sequences.But inclusion-exclusion counts 5. So, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is not the right approach here because of overlapping substrings.Wait, in inclusion-exclusion, we considered (A_1) and (A_2), but in reality, the forbidden sequences are 6, so inclusion-exclusion is not accounting for something.Wait, no, actually, in inclusion-exclusion, (|A_1 cup A_2|) is the number of sequences where \\"RL\\" occurs at least once in positions 1-2 or 2-3. So, it should be 6, but according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 5. So, something is wrong.Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that (|A_i cap A_j| = 1) is incorrect.Wait, for (n=3), (|A_1 cap A_2|) is the number of sequences where both \\"RL\\" occurs at positions 1-2 and 2-3. So, the sequence must be \\"RLR\\". So, only one sequence.Therefore, inclusion-exclusion gives (|A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 cap A_2| = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5), but in reality, there are 6 forbidden sequences.Wait, that suggests that inclusion-exclusion is missing one forbidden sequence.Wait, but according to the definition, (A_1) and (A_2) cover all forbidden sequences. So, why is there a discrepancy?Wait, perhaps because in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are 6, but inclusion-exclusion counts 5, which suggests that there might be an error in the inclusion-exclusion approach.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are 6, but according to the inclusion-exclusion, it's 5, so the inclusion-exclusion is missing one.Wait, but according to the definition, (A_1) and (A_2) should cover all forbidden sequences, so why is it missing one?Wait, no, in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are exactly those in (A_1) or (A_2). So, (A_1) has 3, (A_2) has 3, overlapping at 1, so total 5. So, why do I think there are 6?Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.Wait, \\"RLF\\", \\"RLR\\", \\"RLC\\" are in (A_1).\\"FRL\\", \\"LRL\\", \\"RRL\\" are in (A_2).So, that's 6 sequences, but \\"RLR\\" is in both (A_1) and (A_2), so the total unique forbidden sequences are 5.Wait, no, \\"RLR\\" is one sequence, but when we list them, it's:1. \\"RLF\\"2. \\"RLR\\"3. \\"RLC\\"4. \\"FRL\\"5. \\"LRL\\"6. \\"RRL\\"So, 6 sequences. Therefore, inclusion-exclusion is wrong.Wait, but according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 5. So, that suggests that the inclusion-exclusion is not accounting for all forbidden sequences.Wait, perhaps the problem is that in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are 6, but inclusion-exclusion counts 5, so it's undercounting.Therefore, inclusion-exclusion is not the right approach here because of some overlapping issue.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in inclusion-exclusion, we considered only two sets, but in reality, for (n=3), the forbidden sequences can be in two different positions, but their intersection is only one sequence, so it's correct.Wait, but in reality, we have 6 forbidden sequences, so inclusion-exclusion is wrong.Wait, no, actually, in (n=3), the forbidden sequences are 6, but according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 5. So, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is not the correct method here.Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption is wrong, and the recurrence is correct.Wait, for (n=3), the recurrence gives 21 allowed sequences, which is 27 - 6 = 21. So, that's correct.But inclusion-exclusion gives 22, which is wrong.Therefore, inclusion-exclusion is not the right approach here, probably because of overlapping substrings in a way that inclusion-exclusion doesn't account for.Therefore, the recurrence is correct, and the inclusion-exclusion was wrong.Therefore, going back, for (n=6), the recurrence gives 377 allowed sequences.But according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 378.But in (n=3), the recurrence is correct, inclusion-exclusion is wrong.Therefore, the recurrence is the correct method.Therefore, the number of allowed sequences is 377, so the probability is (frac{377}{729}).But wait, 377 and 729: Let's check if they are coprime.729 divided by 377: 377*1=377, 729-377=352377 divided by 352: 352*1=352, 377-352=25352 divided by 25: 25*14=350, 352-350=225 divided by 2: 2*12=24, 25-24=12 divided by 1: remainder 0.So, GCD is 1. Therefore, (frac{377}{729}) is reduced.Therefore, (m = 377), (n = 729), so (m + n = 377 + 729 = 1106).But wait, in the corrected recurrence, for (n=6), the total is 377, but in the inclusion-exclusion, it's 378.But since for (n=3), the recurrence was correct, and inclusion-exclusion was wrong, I think the recurrence is correct.Therefore, the probability is (frac{377}{729}), so (m + n = 1106).But wait, hold on, in the corrected recurrence, for (n=6), the total is 377, but according to the initial recurrence (which was wrong), it was 239.But in the corrected recurrence, it's 377.Wait, but in the earlier step-by-step, I had:For (n=6):- (a_6 = 144)- (b_6 = 89)- (c_6 = 144)- Total: 144 + 89 + 144 = 377Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the probability is (frac{377}{729}), so (m + n = 377 + 729 = 1106).But wait, the problem statement says \\"the probability that this will **not** happen\\". So, if the recurrence counts the number of sequences without \\"RL\\", which is 377, then the probability is (frac{377}{729}).But wait, in the initial problem, the people are sitting in chairs, and each person chooses independently. So, the total number of possible scenarios is (6! times 3^6), but since the seating is random, the leg positions are independent of the seating. So, the probability is just based on the leg positions, regardless of who sits where.Therefore, the probability is (frac{377}{729}), so (m + n = 1106).But wait, in the problem statement, it's six chairs, six people randomly seat themselves, each person randomly chooses one of three options. So, the total number of possible scenarios is (6! times 3^6), but since the seating is random, the leg positions are independent, so the probability is just based on the leg positions, which is (frac{377}{729}).Therefore, the answer is 1106.But wait, in the initial problem, it's six chairs, six people randomly seat themselves, each person randomly chooses one of three options. So, the total number of possible scenarios is (6! times 3^6), but since the seating is random, the leg positions are independent, so the probability is just based on the leg positions, which is (frac{377}{729}).Therefore, the answer is 1106.But wait, let me check the recurrence once more.Wait, for (n=1), total is 3.For (n=2), total is 8.For (n=3), total is 21.For (n=4), total is 55.For (n=5), total is 144.For (n=6), total is 377.Yes, this seems to follow the pattern of the number of ternary strings avoiding \\"RL\\".Alternatively, this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but in base 3.Wait, actually, the recurrence for (a_n) is (a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}), but since (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}) and (c_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}), we can see that (c_n = a_n), because (c_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} = a_n).Similarly, (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}).Therefore, we can write:- (a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1} = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})- (b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1})Let me write down the terms:For (n=1):- (a_1 = 1)- (b_1 = 1)For (n=2):- (a_2 = 2a_1 + b_1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3)- (b_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2)For (n=3):- (a_3 = 2a_2 + b_2 = 2*3 + 2 = 8)- (b_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 3 + 2 = 5)For (n=4):- (a_4 = 2a_3 + b_3 = 2*8 + 5 = 21)- (b_4 = a_3 + b_3 = 8 + 5 = 13)For (n=5):- (a_5 = 2a_4 + b_4 = 2*21 + 13 = 55)- (b_5 = a_4 + b_4 = 21 + 13 = 34)For (n=6):- (a_6 = 2a_5 + b_5 = 2*55 + 34 = 144)- (b_6 = a_5 + b_5 = 55 + 34 = 89)Total: (a_6 + b_6 + c_6 = 144 + 89 + 144 = 377)Yes, that's consistent.Therefore, the number of valid sequences is 377, so the probability is (frac{377}{729}), which simplifies to itself, so (m + n = 377 + 729 = 1106).Therefore, the answer is (boxed{1106}).**Final Answer**boxed{1106}"},{"question":"What is 11111111_2+111111_2?

Hmm, okay. So this is a complex fraction divided by another complex fraction. I think the best approach is to simplify each part step by step.First, let me recall that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, the entire expression can be rewritten as:[frac{left(a^{2}-b^{2}right)left(a^{2}+sqrt[3]{b^{2}}+a sqrt[3]{b}right)}{a sqrt[3]{b}+a sqrt{a}-b sqrt[3]{b}-sqrt{a b^{2}}} times frac{a sqrt[3]{b}-sqrt[6]{a^{3} b^{2}}-sqrt[3]{b^{2}}+a sqrt{a}}{a^{3}-b}]So, now I have two fractions multiplied together. Let me see if I can factor or simplify the numerators and denominators.Starting with the first numerator: (a² - b²). I know that a² - b² factors into (a - b)(a + b). So, that's a start.Next, the second part of the first numerator is (a² + ∛(b²) + a∛b). Hmm, that looks a bit like a sum of cubes or something similar. Wait, let me think. The sum of cubes formula is a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²). But here, I have a² + ∛(b²) + a∛b. Maybe it's a similar structure.Let me denote x = a and y = ∛b. Then, the expression becomes x² + y² + xy. Hmm, that's x² + xy + y², which is actually the same as (x³ - y³)/(x - y). Wait, is that right? Let me check:(x - y)(x² + xy + y²) = x³ + x²y + xy² - x²y - xy² - y³ = x³ - y³. Yes, that's correct. So, x² + xy + y² = (x³ - y³)/(x - y). So, substituting back, x = a, y = ∛b, so:a² + a∛b + (∛b)² = (a³ - (∛b)³)/(a - ∛b) = (a³ - b)/(a - ∛b).Wait, that's interesting. So, the second factor in the first numerator simplifies to (a³ - b)/(a - ∛b). So, putting it all together, the first numerator is (a² - b²)(a² + ∛b² + a∛b) = (a - b)(a + b) * (a³ - b)/(a - ∛b).So, that's the first numerator. Now, looking at the denominator of the first fraction: a∛b + a√a - b∛b - √(ab²). Let me try to factor this.Looking at the terms:a∛b + a√a - b∛b - √(ab²)I can factor out terms:First, group the first two terms and the last two terms:(a∛b + a√a) - (b∛b + √(ab²))Factor out 'a' from the first group and 'b' from the second group:a(∛b + √a) - b(∛b + √(ab²)/b)Wait, let's see. Let me factor each group:First group: a(∛b + √a)Second group: b(∛b + √(a b²)/b). Wait, √(ab²) is √a * b, right? Because √(ab²) = √a * √(b²) = √a * b. So, √(ab²) = b√a.So, the second group is b(∛b + √a). Therefore, the denominator becomes:a(∛b + √a) - b(∛b + √a) = (a - b)(∛b + √a)Ah, nice! So, the denominator simplifies to (a - b)(∛b + √a). So, putting it all together, the first fraction simplifies to:[(a - b)(a + b) * (a³ - b)/(a - ∛b)] / [(a - b)(∛b + √a)]We can cancel out (a - b) from numerator and denominator:[(a + b) * (a³ - b)/(a - ∛b)] / (∛b + √a)So, now we have:[(a + b)(a³ - b)] / [(a - ∛b)(∛b + √a)]Hmm, let's see if we can factor (a³ - b). That's a difference of cubes, so it factors into (a - ∛b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)²). So, (a³ - b) = (a - ∛b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2).So, substituting that in, the numerator becomes:(a + b)(a - ∛b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2)And the denominator is (a - ∛b)(∛b + √a). So, we can cancel out (a - ∛b) from numerator and denominator:[(a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2)] / (∛b + √a)So, now we have:(a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) / (∛b + √a)Hmm, let me see if I can factor the numerator further or if the denominator can be related to the numerator.Looking at the denominator: ∛b + √a. Let me denote x = ∛b and y = √a. Then, the denominator is x + y.Looking at the numerator: (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2). Let's see, a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2 is similar to the earlier expression. Wait, if I set z = a and w = ∛b, then a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2 = z² + zw + w², which is equal to (z³ - w³)/(z - w). So, that's (a³ - (∛b)^3)/(a - ∛b) = (a³ - b)/(a - ∛b). Wait, but we already factored that earlier.But in the numerator, we have (a + b) times that. So, perhaps another approach.Wait, let me think. The denominator is ∛b + √a, which is x + y. The numerator is (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2). Maybe I can express a + b in terms of x and y?Wait, a is 4.91 and b is 0.09, but maybe symbolically, a + b is just a + b. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.Alternatively, maybe we can factor the numerator in terms of the denominator.Wait, let's see:(a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) = (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2)Is there a way to write this as something times (∛b + √a)? Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out something else.Wait, let me compute the denominator: ∛b + √a. Let me compute that with the given values, but maybe it's better to keep it symbolic for now.Alternatively, maybe I can write the numerator as (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) = (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2). Hmm, perhaps not.Wait, maybe I can factor the numerator as (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) = (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) = (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2). Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe let's try to compute the numerator and denominator separately.Wait, let me see. The numerator is (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) and the denominator is (∛b + √a). Maybe I can perform polynomial division or see if (∛b + √a) is a factor.Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) and see if it can be expressed in terms of (∛b + √a). Hmm, not sure.Wait, maybe let's think about the second fraction in the original expression. The second fraction is:(a³ - b) / [a∛b - √[6]{a³b²} - ∛b² + a√a]So, let me try to simplify that denominator as well.Denominator of the second fraction: a∛b - √[6]{a³b²} - ∛b² + a√a.Let me see if I can factor this.First, let me note that √[6]{a³b²} is equal to (a³b²)^{1/6} = a^{1/2}b^{1/3} = √a * ∛b.Similarly, ∛b² is (∛b)^2.So, substituting back, the denominator becomes:a∛b - √a∛b - (∛b)^2 + a√aSo, let's write it as:a∛b - √a∛b - (∛b)^2 + a√aNow, let's group terms:Group the first two terms: a∛b - √a∛b = ∛b(a - √a)Group the last two terms: - (∛b)^2 + a√a = a√a - (∛b)^2So, the denominator is:∛b(a - √a) + (a√a - (∛b)^2)Hmm, maybe factor further.Looking at the first group: ∛b(a - √a) = ∛b * √a(√a - 1) [since a - √a = √a(√a - 1)]Similarly, the second group: a√a - (∛b)^2 = √a * a - (∛b)^2 = √a * a - (∛b)^2Wait, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps factor out √a from the second group:a√a - (∛b)^2 = √a(a) - (∛b)^2Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe factor the entire denominator as:∛b(a - √a) + (a√a - (∛b)^2) = ∛b(a - √a) + a√a - (∛b)^2Hmm, maybe factor out (a - ∛b) or something.Alternatively, let me denote x = ∛b and y = √a. Then, the denominator becomes:x(a - y) + y a - x²But a is a variable, so maybe not helpful.Wait, let me substitute x = ∛b and y = √a, then:Denominator = x(a - y) + y a - x² = x a - x y + y a - x²Hmm, let's rearrange:= (x a + y a) - (x y + x²) = a(x + y) - x(y + x) = (a - x)(x + y)Ah! That's nice. So, denominator = (a - x)(x + y) where x = ∛b and y = √a.So, substituting back, denominator = (a - ∛b)(∛b + √a)So, the denominator of the second fraction is (a - ∛b)(∛b + √a). Therefore, the second fraction is:(a³ - b) / [(a - ∛b)(∛b + √a)]But earlier, we saw that (a³ - b) factors into (a - ∛b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2). So, substituting that in, the second fraction becomes:[(a - ∛b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2)] / [(a - ∛b)(∛b + √a)] = (a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) / (∛b + √a)So, the second fraction simplifies to (a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) / (∛b + √a)Therefore, going back to the entire expression, which was:First fraction * reciprocal of second fraction = [First fraction] * [Second fraction's reciprocal]But wait, actually, initially, we had:First fraction : Second fraction = First fraction * reciprocal of Second fractionBut we simplified the first fraction to:[(a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2)] / (∛b + √a)And the second fraction simplified to:(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) / (∛b + √a)So, the entire expression is:[ (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) / (∛b + √a) ] * [ (∛b + √a) / (a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) ]Ah, now I see that (a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) cancels out, and (∛b + √a) cancels out as well. So, we are left with just (a + b).So, the entire expression simplifies to (a + b).Wow, that's a significant simplification. So, regardless of the complexity, it all reduces to a + b.Therefore, substituting the given values, a = 4.91 and b = 0.09, we have:a + b = 4.91 + 0.09 = 5.00So, the value of the expression is 5.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Factored the first numerator: (a² - b²) = (a - b)(a + b). Then, the second factor was recognized as (a³ - b)/(a - ∛b). So, numerator became (a - b)(a + b)(a³ - b)/(a - ∛b).2. Denominator of the first fraction was factored into (a - b)(∛b + √a). So, after canceling (a - b), we had (a + b)(a³ - b)/(a - ∛b) divided by (∛b + √a).3. Then, (a³ - b) was factored into (a - ∛b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2), so numerator became (a + b)(a - ∛b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2), denominator was (a - ∛b)(∛b + √a). Canceling (a - ∛b), we had (a + b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2)/(∛b + √a).4. Then, moving to the second fraction, denominator was factored into (a - ∛b)(∛b + √a), and numerator was (a³ - b) = (a - ∛b)(a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2). So, the second fraction simplified to (a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2)/(∛b + √a).5. Therefore, when multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction, the (a² + a∛b + (∛b)^2) and (∛b + √a) terms canceled out, leaving just (a + b).6. Substituting a = 4.91 and b = 0.09, we get 4.91 + 0.09 = 5.00.Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 5."},{"question":"With line segments a = 16, b = 13, c = 10, and d = 6 as sides, such that a parallel c, form a quadrilateral. How many such quadrilaterals can be formed?(A) One;(B) Two;(C) Three;(D) Infinitely many;(E) Cannot be formed.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to form a quadrilateral with four line segments: a = 16, b = 13, c = 10, and d = 6. The condition is that sides a and c are parallel. The question is asking how many such quadrilaterals can be formed, and the options are one, two, three, infinitely many, or cannot be formed. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon, and for it to be valid, the sum of any three sides must be greater than the fourth side. But wait, actually, that's the triangle inequality. For quadrilaterals, the sum of any three sides must be greater than the fourth side as well. So, let me check if these sides satisfy that condition.Let me list the sides: 16, 13, 10, and 6.Check 16 + 13 + 10 > 6: 39 > 6, which is true.Check 16 + 13 + 6 > 10: 35 > 10, true.Check 16 + 10 + 6 > 13: 32 > 13, true.Check 13 + 10 + 6 > 16: 29 > 16, true.Okay, so all the quadrilateral inequalities are satisfied. So, in theory, a quadrilateral can be formed with these sides.But now, the additional condition is that sides a and c are parallel. So, sides of length 16 and 10 must be parallel. Hmm, how does that affect the number of possible quadrilaterals?I think when two sides are parallel, the quadrilateral is a trapezoid. So, we're talking about trapezoids here. Now, in a trapezoid, the two non-parallel sides are called the legs, and the parallel sides are called the bases.So, in this case, sides a = 16 and c = 10 are the bases, and sides b = 13 and d = 6 are the legs. Wait, but actually, in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides, so in this case, sides b and d are the legs.But hold on, can we have a trapezoid with legs of lengths 13 and 6? I think so, as long as the other conditions are satisfied.But how many different trapezoids can we form with these sides? Hmm, I think it depends on the lengths of the sides and whether they can form different configurations.I remember that when you have two sides parallel, the distance between them (the height) can vary, but in this case, since all sides are fixed, maybe the number of possible trapezoids is limited.Wait, maybe it's about the order of the sides. So, in a quadrilateral, the sides are connected in order, so the sides a, b, c, d must be connected in sequence. So, if a and c are parallel, then the sides b and d are the legs connecting them.But depending on how we arrange the sides, maybe we can have different trapezoids.Wait, but the sides are fixed in length, so maybe the number of trapezoids depends on the possible configurations where a and c are parallel.Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible trapezoids can be determined by considering the triangle inequality for the legs and the difference in lengths of the bases.Let me recall that in a trapezoid, the legs must satisfy the condition that the sum of the lengths of the legs must be greater than the difference of the lengths of the bases.Wait, is that correct? Let me think.In a trapezoid, if you have two bases of lengths a and c, and legs of lengths b and d, then the legs must be able to connect the two bases. So, the legs must satisfy that the sum of the lengths of the legs is greater than the difference of the lengths of the bases.So, the formula is: |a - c| < b + d.Wait, is that the case? Let me check.Yes, actually, in a trapezoid, the legs must be able to reach from one base to the other. So, the sum of the lengths of the legs must be greater than the difference of the lengths of the bases.So, in this case, |16 - 10| = 6. Then, the sum of the legs is 13 + 6 = 19. Since 19 > 6, that condition is satisfied.But does this condition ensure that only one trapezoid can be formed? Or can multiple trapezoids be formed?Wait, actually, in a trapezoid, if you fix the lengths of the bases and the legs, the trapezoid is uniquely determined up to congruence. So, maybe only one trapezoid can be formed.But wait, no, actually, depending on the angles, you can have different trapezoids with the same side lengths but different angles, making them non-congruent.Wait, but if all sides are fixed, then the trapezoid is determined uniquely. Because if you fix the lengths of all sides, then the shape is fixed, right? Because in a trapezoid, once you fix the lengths of the two bases and the two legs, the angles are determined.Wait, but actually, that might not be the case. Because in a trapezoid, the legs can be slanting in different ways, but if the lengths are fixed, then the angles are fixed as well.Wait, let me think about it differently. If I have two parallel sides, 16 and 10, and the legs are 13 and 6, can I arrange them in two different ways?Wait, perhaps if I switch the legs, but since the legs are of different lengths, 13 and 6, switching them would result in a different trapezoid.Wait, but in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides, so if I have sides a=16, b=13, c=10, d=6, then the sides are connected as a-b-c-d-a.So, sides a and c are parallel, so sides b and d are the legs. So, the legs are fixed as 13 and 6. So, you can't really switch them because the sides are in a specific order.Wait, but maybe you can arrange the sides in a different order, such that a and c are still parallel, but the legs are arranged differently.Wait, but the sides are given as a=16, b=13, c=10, d=6. So, the order is fixed as a, b, c, d. So, sides a and c are opposite each other, so they can be made parallel.But in a quadrilateral, the order of sides matters. So, if I fix the order as a, b, c, d, then sides a and c are opposite, and if they are parallel, then it's a trapezoid.But is it possible to arrange the sides in a different order such that a and c are still parallel?Wait, but the problem says \\"with line segments a=16, b=13, c=10, and d=6 as sides, such that a parallel c, form a quadrilateral.\\" So, it doesn't specify the order of the sides, just that a and c are parallel.So, perhaps the sides can be arranged in different orders, as long as a and c are parallel.So, in that case, maybe there are multiple quadrilaterals possible, depending on the order of the sides.Wait, so if I fix a and c as parallel, then the other sides can be arranged in different ways.So, for example, one possibility is a, b, c, d, with a and c parallel, and sides b and d as legs.Another possibility is a, d, c, b, with a and c parallel, and sides d and b as legs.But since sides b and d are different lengths, 13 and 6, these would result in different trapezoids.Wait, but in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. So, if I arrange the sides as a, b, c, d, then legs are b and d. If I arrange them as a, d, c, b, then legs are d and b, which is the same as before.Wait, so maybe the order doesn't matter because the legs are still the same.Wait, but actually, in terms of the trapezoid, the legs are connected to the bases. So, if I switch the order, maybe the angles change.Wait, perhaps the trapezoid can be convex or concave, but since all sides are positive lengths, it's convex.Wait, maybe it's about the direction in which the legs are slanting. So, if I have a longer leg on one side or the other, it can create different trapezoids.Wait, but in reality, if the lengths of the legs and the bases are fixed, the trapezoid is uniquely determined. Because the legs have fixed lengths, and the bases have fixed lengths, so the angles are fixed.Wait, but actually, no. Because in a trapezoid, the legs can be arranged in two different ways: either both legs leaning to the same side, or one leg leaning left and the other leaning right, but since the lengths are different, this might result in different trapezoids.Wait, maybe not. Because if you have two legs of different lengths, the trapezoid is uniquely determined.Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should draw a diagram or use some formulas.Wait, another approach: in a trapezoid, the distance between the two bases is the height. The height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem if we know the difference in the lengths of the bases and the lengths of the legs.So, let me denote the two bases as a = 16 and c = 10. The difference in their lengths is 16 - 10 = 6.Now, if we imagine the trapezoid, the longer base is 16, the shorter is 10. So, if we extend the non-parallel sides, they will form triangles on either end.Wait, actually, the legs are the non-parallel sides, so each leg forms a triangle with the difference in the bases.Wait, so the projection of each leg onto the base will account for the difference in the lengths of the bases.So, the total difference is 6, so each leg will have a horizontal component that adds up to 6.So, if we denote the horizontal components of the legs as x and y, then x + y = 6.And the vertical components (the heights) of both legs must be equal because the distance between the two bases is the same.So, for leg b = 13, the horizontal component is x, and the vertical component is h, so x² + h² = 13².Similarly, for leg d = 6, the horizontal component is y, and the vertical component is h, so y² + h² = 6².And we know that x + y = 6.So, we have the system of equations:1. x + y = 62. x² + h² = 1693. y² + h² = 36Subtracting equation 3 from equation 2:x² - y² = 169 - 36 = 133Which can be written as (x - y)(x + y) = 133We know that x + y = 6, so (x - y)*6 = 133Therefore, x - y = 133 / 6 ≈ 22.1667But x + y = 6 and x - y ≈ 22.1667Adding these two equations:2x ≈ 28.1667 => x ≈ 14.0833But x is supposed to be a horizontal component, which is less than the length of the leg, which is 13. But 14.0833 is greater than 13, which is impossible because x² + h² = 13², so x cannot exceed 13.Wait, that can't be. So, this suggests that there is no solution, meaning that such a trapezoid cannot be formed.But wait, that contradicts our earlier conclusion that the quadrilateral inequalities are satisfied.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.Let me go through it again.We have:1. x + y = 62. x² + h² = 1693. y² + h² = 36Subtracting equation 3 from equation 2:x² - y² = 133Which is (x - y)(x + y) = 133We know x + y = 6, so:(x - y)*6 = 133 => x - y = 133 / 6 ≈ 22.1667But then, solving for x and y:From x + y = 6 and x - y ≈ 22.1667Adding the two equations:2x ≈ 28.1667 => x ≈ 14.0833But x is the horizontal component of leg b = 13, so x must satisfy x ≤ 13, but 14.0833 > 13, which is impossible.Therefore, this suggests that such a trapezoid cannot exist.Wait, but earlier I thought that the quadrilateral inequalities were satisfied, so a quadrilateral can be formed. But with the condition that a and c are parallel, it seems that it's impossible because the horizontal component x exceeds the length of the leg.Hmm, so maybe the answer is that it cannot be formed.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the order of the sides.In the problem, it says \\"with line segments a = 16, b = 13, c = 10, and d = 6 as sides, such that a parallel c, form a quadrilateral.\\"So, maybe the sides are not necessarily in the order a, b, c, d. Maybe they can be arranged differently as long as a and c are parallel.So, perhaps, instead of having sides a, b, c, d, we can arrange them as a, d, c, b, or some other order.Wait, but in a quadrilateral, the sides are connected in a cyclic order. So, if a and c are parallel, they must be opposite sides.So, the quadrilateral would have sides a, b, c, d in order, with a and c opposite and parallel.Alternatively, it could be a, d, c, b, but in that case, a and c are still opposite and parallel.Wait, but in both cases, the legs would be b and d, so the same as before.So, regardless of the order, the legs are still 13 and 6, and the bases are 16 and 10.So, the same problem arises: when trying to compute the horizontal components, x and y, we end up with x ≈ 14.0833, which is longer than the leg itself, which is 13.Therefore, such a trapezoid cannot exist.Wait, but that contradicts the quadrilateral inequality, which said that a quadrilateral can be formed.Hmm, maybe the issue is that when a and c are parallel, the other sides cannot satisfy the necessary conditions for a trapezoid.Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is not a trapezoid but another type of quadrilateral where a and c are parallel, but it's not a trapezoid because maybe the other sides are not legs.Wait, no, in a quadrilateral, if two sides are parallel, it's called a trapezoid.So, if a and c are parallel, it's a trapezoid, and the other sides are legs.But in this case, the legs cannot satisfy the necessary conditions because the horizontal component exceeds the leg length.Therefore, such a trapezoid cannot be formed.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the difference in the bases is 6.Wait, the longer base is 16, the shorter is 10, so the difference is 6. So, when you extend the non-parallel sides, the total overhang on both sides is 6.But if the legs are 13 and 6, then the horizontal components x and y must add up to 6.But as we saw, x ≈14.0833, which is impossible.Wait, maybe I should consider that the longer base is 16, and the shorter is 10, so the difference is 6, but maybe the overhang is distributed differently.Wait, but in reality, the overhang depends on the angles of the legs.Wait, perhaps if I arrange the trapezoid such that one leg is much steeper than the other, so that the horizontal components add up to 6.But even so, the horizontal component of the leg with length 13 cannot exceed 13, and similarly for the leg with length 6.Wait, let me think about the maximum possible horizontal component for each leg.For leg b = 13, the maximum horizontal component is 13 (if the leg is horizontal), but in reality, it's slanting upwards, so the horizontal component is less than 13.Similarly, for leg d = 6, the maximum horizontal component is 6.So, the total maximum horizontal component is 13 + 6 = 19, but we only need 6.Wait, so that's not the issue.Wait, but in our calculation, we found that x ≈14.0833, which is more than 13, which is the length of leg b.So, that suggests that such a trapezoid cannot exist.Therefore, the answer is that it cannot be formed.But wait, let me check another approach.Maybe instead of assuming that the trapezoid is convex, it could be concave.But in a concave trapezoid, one of the angles is greater than 180 degrees, but I don't know if that affects the horizontal components.Wait, but even in a concave trapezoid, the legs still have to connect the two bases, so the horizontal components would still have to add up to the difference in the bases.So, the same problem would occur.Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is not convex, but I don't think that changes the horizontal component calculation.Wait, perhaps I should consider that the difference in the bases is 6, so the total horizontal projection needed is 6.But the legs are 13 and 6, so their horizontal projections must add up to 6.But if we denote x as the horizontal projection of leg b =13, and y as the horizontal projection of leg d=6, then x + y =6.But also, the vertical projections must be equal, since the height of the trapezoid is the same.So, for leg b: x² + h² =13²For leg d: y² + h² =6²Subtracting the two equations:x² - y² =169 -36=133Which factors into (x - y)(x + y)=133We know that x + y=6, so (x - y)*6=133 => x - y=133/6≈22.1667So, x + y=6 and x - y≈22.1667Adding these two equations:2x≈28.1667 =>x≈14.0833But x is the horizontal projection of leg b=13, which must satisfy x ≤13, but 14.0833>13, which is impossible.Therefore, such a trapezoid cannot exist.Therefore, the answer is (E) Cannot be formed.But wait, the quadrilateral inequalities were satisfied, so a quadrilateral can be formed, but with a and c not necessarily parallel.But the problem specifies that a and c must be parallel, so if that condition cannot be satisfied, then the quadrilateral cannot be formed.Therefore, the answer is (E).But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the order of the sides.Suppose instead that the sides are arranged as a, b, c, d, but with a and c not being opposite sides.Wait, but in a quadrilateral, opposite sides are the ones that don't intersect. So, if a and c are parallel, they must be opposite sides.Therefore, the sides must be arranged such that a and c are opposite, so the order is a, b, c, d, or a, d, c, b.But in either case, the legs are b and d, which are 13 and 6.So, regardless of the order, the same problem occurs.Therefore, it's impossible to form such a trapezoid.Hence, the answer is (E) Cannot be formed.But wait, the options were (A) One; (B) Two; (C) Three; (D) Infinitely many; (E) Cannot be formed.So, the answer is (E).But wait, let me check another approach. Maybe the trapezoid is not required to have the legs on the same side.Wait, but in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides, so they must be on the same side, connecting the two bases.Wait, no, actually, in a trapezoid, the legs are the sides that are not parallel, so they connect the two bases, but they can be on different sides.Wait, but regardless, the horizontal projections must add up to the difference in the bases.So, I think the conclusion remains the same.Therefore, the answer is (E) Cannot be formed."},{"question":"Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve y=x^{2}+3x at x=2.","answer":"To find the slope of the tangent line to the curve ( y = x^2 + 3x ) at ( x = 2 ), I need to determine the derivative of the function with respect to ( x ). The derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve.First, I'll find the derivative of ( y ) with respect to ( x ). Using basic differentiation rules, the derivative of ( x^2 ) is ( 2x ) and the derivative of ( 3x ) is ( 3 ). Adding these together, the derivative ( y' ) is ( 2x + 3 ).Next, I'll substitute ( x = 2 ) into the derivative to find the slope at that specific point.

Then, a point was placed between each pair of neighboring points, and this operation was repeated once more. As a result, there were 101 points. How many points were initially marked?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Several points were marked on a line. Then, a point was placed between each pair of neighboring points, and this operation was repeated once more. As a result, there were 101 points. How many points were initially marked?Hmm, let me try to understand. So, initially, there are some points on a line. Let's say the number of points is n. Then, between each pair of neighboring points, a new point is placed. So, if there are n points, there are (n - 1) gaps between them. Placing a point in each gap would add (n - 1) points, right? So after the first operation, the total number of points becomes n + (n - 1) = 2n - 1.Wait, let me verify that. If I have, say, 2 points, then placing a point between them would give me 3 points. So, 2n - 1 when n=2 is 3, which is correct. Similarly, if I have 3 points, there are 2 gaps, so adding 2 points gives me 5 points. 2n - 1 when n=3 is 5, which is also correct. Okay, so the formula seems right.Now, the operation is repeated once more. So, starting from 2n - 1 points, we perform the same operation again. Let's denote the number of points after the first operation as m = 2n - 1. Then, the number of gaps between these m points is (m - 1). So, adding a point in each gap would add (m - 1) points, making the total number of points after the second operation equal to m + (m - 1) = 2m - 1.Substituting m = 2n - 1, the total number of points after the second operation is 2*(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 2 - 1 = 4n - 3.According to the problem, after two operations, the total number of points is 101. So, we can set up the equation:4n - 3 = 101Now, solving for n:4n = 101 + 34n = 104n = 104 / 4n = 26So, the initial number of points marked was 26.Wait, let me check this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 26 points:First operation: 2*26 - 1 = 52 - 1 = 51 points.Second operation: 2*51 - 1 = 102 - 1 = 101 points.Yes, that's correct. So, 26 points initially.But just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. Maybe using a different approach to confirm.Suppose we model the number of points after each operation. Let’s denote the number of points after k operations as P(k). Then, each operation adds a point between every pair of neighboring points, which effectively doubles the number of points minus one. So, the recurrence relation is P(k+1) = 2*P(k) - 1.Given that P(0) = n, the initial number of points.After the first operation, P(1) = 2n - 1.After the second operation, P(2) = 2*(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 2 - 1 = 4n - 3.We know that P(2) = 101, so 4n - 3 = 101, which gives n = 26 as before.Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of intervals. Each time we add points, we're effectively subdividing each interval into two. So, starting with n points, which create (n - 1) intervals. After one operation, each interval is split into two, so the number of intervals becomes 2*(n - 1). Thus, the number of points becomes (2*(n - 1)) + 1 = 2n - 1.After the second operation, each of those 2*(n - 1) intervals is split again, so the number of intervals becomes 4*(n - 1). Therefore, the number of points is 4*(n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 4 + 1 = 4n - 3. Which is the same as before.So, 4n - 3 = 101, so n = (101 + 3)/4 = 104/4 = 26.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can think about how each operation affects the number of intervals. Let me try that.Starting with n points, we have (n - 1) intervals. After the first operation, each interval is split into two, so the number of intervals becomes 2*(n - 1). Therefore, the number of points is (2*(n - 1)) + 1 = 2n - 1.After the second operation, each of those 2*(n - 1) intervals is split again, so the number of intervals becomes 4*(n - 1). Thus, the number of points is 4*(n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 4 + 1 = 4n - 3.Again, same result. So, 4n - 3 = 101, so n = 26.I think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the initial number of points was 26.**Final Answer**The initial number of points marked was boxed{26}."},{"question":"Given that the function f(x) = 2g(x) - x² is an odd function, and g(-1) = -1, find the value of f(1).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the function f(x) is defined as 2g(x) minus x squared, and it's given that f(x) is an odd function. Also, we know that g(-1) is equal to -1. The question is asking me to find the value of f(1). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let's recall what an odd function is. An odd function satisfies the property that f(-x) is equal to -f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I plug in -x into the function, it's the same as multiplying the original function by -1. That's a key property we can use here.Given that f(x) = 2g(x) - x², and f is odd, so f(-x) = -f(x). Let me write that out:f(-x) = 2g(-x) - (-x)²But (-x) squared is just x squared, so that simplifies to:f(-x) = 2g(-x) - x²On the other hand, since f is odd, f(-x) should also equal -f(x). Let's compute -f(x):-f(x) = -[2g(x) - x²] = -2g(x) + x²So, putting it together, we have:2g(-x) - x² = -2g(x) + x²Hmm, okay, that's an equation involving g(-x) and g(x). Let me rearrange this equation to solve for g(-x). Let's move all terms to one side:2g(-x) - x² + 2g(x) - x² = 0Wait, actually, that might not be the best approach. Let me instead bring all terms to one side step by step.Starting from:2g(-x) - x² = -2g(x) + x²Let me add 2g(x) to both sides:2g(-x) - x² + 2g(x) = x²Then, add x² to both sides:2g(-x) + 2g(x) = 2x²Hmm, okay, so that simplifies to:2[g(-x) + g(x)] = 2x²Divide both sides by 2:g(-x) + g(x) = x²So, we have that g(-x) + g(x) equals x squared. That's a useful relationship. It tells us that the sum of g at x and g at -x is equal to x squared.Now, we know that g(-1) is given as -1. Let's plug x = 1 into the equation we just derived:g(-1) + g(1) = (1)² = 1We know that g(-1) is -1, so substituting that in:-1 + g(1) = 1Solving for g(1):g(1) = 1 + 1 = 2Okay, so g(1) is 2. Now, we need to find f(1). Let's recall the definition of f(x):f(x) = 2g(x) - x²So, plugging x = 1 into this:f(1) = 2g(1) - (1)² = 2*2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3So, f(1) is 3. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I started by recalling that an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x).2. I substituted -x into f(x) and simplified, leading me to an equation involving g(-x) and g(x).3. I rearranged the equation to find that g(-x) + g(x) = x².4. Plugging x = 1 into this equation, I used the given value of g(-1) to solve for g(1).5. Finally, I substituted g(1) back into the expression for f(1) to find the result.Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in the reasoning or calculations.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(1) ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"A positive number is divisible by both 3 and 4.

I need to figure out which of these functions are invertible and then find the product of their labels. The domain of function (3) is given as {-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. Hmm, okay.First, I remember that a function is invertible if it is one-to-one, meaning that each input has a unique output and each output comes from exactly one input. In other words, the function must pass the horizontal line test. If any horizontal line intersects the graph of the function more than once, then the function is not one-to-one and therefore not invertible.So, I need to analyze each function one by one.Starting with function (2). The Asymptote code shows that it's defined as f(x) = x² - 2x. Let me visualize this. It's a quadratic function, so its graph is a parabola. Since the coefficient of x² is positive, it opens upwards. The vertex of this parabola can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a). Here, a = 1 and b = -2, so x = -(-2)/(2*1) = 2/2 = 1. So, the vertex is at x = 1. Plugging back into f(x), f(1) = 1 - 2 = -1. So, the vertex is at (1, -1).Since it's a parabola opening upwards, it will have a minimum at (1, -1). Now, does this function pass the horizontal line test? Well, parabolas are symmetric about their vertex. So, if I draw a horizontal line above the vertex, it will intersect the parabola at two points. For example, the line y = 0 will intersect the parabola at two points: solving x² - 2x = 0 gives x(x - 2) = 0, so x = 0 and x = 2. Therefore, the function is not one-to-one over its entire domain, which is all real numbers unless restricted. Since the Asymptote code draws it from x = -2 to x = 4, which is a restricted domain. Wait, does the domain affect invertibility?Yes, it does. If the domain is restricted such that the function is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, then it can be invertible. Let me check the function f(x) = x² - 2x on the interval from -2 to 4.The vertex is at x = 1, so from x = -2 to x = 1, the function is decreasing, and from x = 1 to x = 4, it's increasing. So, the function first decreases from (-2, f(-2)) to (1, -1), then increases from (1, -1) to (4, f(4)). So, on the interval [-2, 4], the function is not strictly increasing or decreasing. Therefore, it's not one-to-one over this interval. Hence, function (2) is not invertible.Wait, but maybe the function is invertible if we restrict the domain further? But in this case, the Asymptote code draws the function from -2 to 4, so I think we have to consider that as the domain. So, function (2) is not invertible because it's not one-to-one over its given domain.Moving on to function (3). The domain is given as {-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. So, it's a discrete set of points. The graph is plotted with dots at these x-values. Let me see the coordinates: (-5, 3), (-4, 5), (-3, 1), (-2, 0), (-1, 2), (0, -4), (1, -3), (2, -2). So, each x-value maps to a unique y-value. Since each input has a unique output, and since the function is defined only on these discrete points, it's automatically one-to-one because there are no two different x-values mapping to the same y-value. Let me check the y-values: 3, 5, 1, 0, 2, -4, -3, -2. All of these are unique. So, function (3) is invertible because it's one-to-one.Next, function (4). The Asymptote code defines it as h(x) = -atan(x). So, arctangent function with a negative sign. Let me recall that the arctangent function, atan(x), is a strictly increasing function with a horizontal asymptote at y = π/2 as x approaches infinity and y = -π/2 as x approaches negative infinity. So, h(x) = -atan(x) would be a strictly decreasing function, because of the negative sign. Its graph would go from π/2 at x = -infty to -π/2 at x = infty, but flipped because of the negative sign.Wait, actually, h(x) = -atan(x) would have a horizontal asymptote at y = -π/2 as x approaches infinity and y = π/2 as x approaches negative infinity. So, it's a strictly decreasing function. Since it's strictly decreasing over its entire domain, which is all real numbers, it is one-to-one. Therefore, function (4) is invertible.Lastly, function (5). The Asymptote code defines it as k(x) = 4/x. So, this is a hyperbola. Let me recall that k(x) = 4/x is a hyperbola with two branches, one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant. The function is defined for all x except x = 0. Now, is this function one-to-one? Let's see.For x > 0, as x increases, k(x) decreases, approaching zero. For x < 0, as x becomes more negative, k(x) also approaches zero from the negative side. So, the function is strictly decreasing on its entire domain, except at x = 0 where it's undefined. Since it's strictly decreasing on both intervals (-infty, 0) and (0, infty), but across the entire domain, is it one-to-one?Wait, actually, if we consider the entire domain, which is all real numbers except zero, the function is one-to-one because each x maps to a unique y, and each y (except zero) maps back to a unique x. However, in the Asymptote code, it's drawn as two separate branches, one from x = -8 to x = -0.5, and another from x = 0.5 to x = 8. So, the function is plotted on two intervals: (-8, -0.5) and (0.5, 8). So, is this function invertible?Since on each of these intervals, the function is strictly decreasing, so on each interval, it's one-to-one. However, if we consider the entire function, it's also one-to-one because the outputs from the two branches don't overlap. The left branch (negative x) gives negative y-values, and the right branch (positive x) gives positive y-values. So, overall, the function is one-to-one.Wait, but actually, when considering invertibility, if the function is one-to-one over its entire domain, then it's invertible. So, since k(x) = 4/x is one-to-one over its entire domain (all real numbers except zero), it is invertible. Its inverse would be k^{-1}(x) = 4/x as well, because swapping x and y gives x = 4/y, so y = 4/x.Wait, hold on. Let me verify that. If k(x) = 4/x, then to find the inverse, we set y = 4/x, swap x and y: x = 4/y, then solve for y: y = 4/x. So, yes, the inverse is the same function. So, function (5) is invertible.Wait, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawn from x = -8 to x = -0.5 and from x = 0.5 to x = 8. So, is the function defined on two separate intervals? Or is it defined on the entire domain except zero? The Asymptote code draws it on two separate intervals, but the function itself is defined on all real numbers except zero. So, if the function is plotted on two separate intervals, does that affect invertibility?Hmm, invertibility depends on the function being one-to-one over its entire domain. Since k(x) = 4/x is one-to-one over its entire domain, even though it's plotted in two separate pieces, it's still invertible. So, function (5) is invertible.Wait, but sometimes when a function is split into two separate pieces, people might think it's not invertible, but as long as the entire function is one-to-one, it's invertible. So, yes, function (5) is invertible.So, summarizing:Function (2): Not invertible.Function (3): Invertible.Function (4): Invertible.Function (5): Invertible.Therefore, the invertible functions are (3), (4), and (5). Their labels are 3, 4, and 5.Wait, hold on. The question says \\"the product of the labels of the functions which are invertible.\\" So, labels are 3, 4, and 5. So, the product is 3 * 4 * 5.But wait, let me double-check function (5). I thought it was invertible because it's one-to-one, but sometimes when functions have asymptotes or are split into branches, people might question invertibility. But as I thought earlier, since it's one-to-one over its entire domain, it's invertible.But let me think again. The function k(x) = 4/x is indeed invertible because it's strictly decreasing over its entire domain, and it's bijective from (-infty, 0) to (-infty, 0) and from (0, infty) to (0, infty). So, yes, it's invertible.So, functions (3), (4), and (5) are invertible. Their labels are 3, 4, and 5. So, the product is 3 * 4 * 5 = 60.Wait, but hold on. Let me check function (3) again. It's a discrete function with domain {-5, -4, ..., 2} and each x maps to a unique y. So, it's one-to-one because all y-values are unique. So, yes, invertible.Function (4) is h(x) = -atan(x), which is strictly decreasing, so invertible.Function (5) is k(x) = 4/x, which is invertible as discussed.So, the product is 3 * 4 * 5 = 60.But wait, hold on. The problem says \\"the product of the labels of the functions which are invertible.\\" So, if functions (3), (4), and (5) are invertible, then the labels are 3, 4, 5. So, 3 * 4 * 5 is 60. But let me check the Asymptote code again.Looking back at the Asymptote code:Function (2): f(x) = x² - 2x, drawn from x = -2 to 4.Function (3): Discrete points with given coordinates.Function (4): h(x) = -atan(x), drawn from x = -8 to 8.Function (5): k(x) = 4/x, drawn from x = -8 to -0.5 and x = 0.5 to 8.So, function (5) is drawn on two separate intervals, but as I thought earlier, it's still invertible because it's one-to-one over its entire domain.Wait, but let me think about function (5). If we consider the entire function, it's one-to-one, but if we only consider the drawn parts, which are two separate branches, does that affect invertibility? Hmm, invertibility is about the function as a whole, not just the parts that are drawn. So, since the function is one-to-one over its entire domain, it's invertible regardless of how it's drawn.Therefore, functions (3), (4), and (5) are invertible. So, the product is 3 * 4 * 5 = 60.Wait, but hold on. Let me check function (2) again. I thought it's not invertible because it's a parabola, but maybe if the domain is restricted, it can be invertible. Wait, the Asymptote code draws it from x = -2 to x = 4. So, is that domain restriction enough to make it invertible?Function (2): f(x) = x² - 2x. The vertex is at x = 1, so from x = -2 to x = 1, it's decreasing, and from x = 1 to x = 4, it's increasing. So, on the interval [-2, 4], it's not strictly increasing or decreasing. Therefore, it's not one-to-one. For example, f(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2*(-2) = 4 + 4 = 8. f(4) = 16 - 8 = 8. So, f(-2) = f(4) = 8, meaning two different x-values map to the same y-value. Therefore, function (2) is not invertible.So, yeah, function (2) is not invertible.Therefore, only functions (3), (4), and (5) are invertible. So, their labels are 3, 4, and 5. The product is 3 * 4 * 5 = 60.Wait, but hold on. The problem says \\"the product of the labels of the functions which are invertible.\\" So, if the invertible functions are (3), (4), and (5), then their labels are 3, 4, 5. So, 3 * 4 * 5 is 60.But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me think about function (3). It's a finite set of points, each x maps to a unique y, so it's invertible. Function (4) is strictly decreasing, so invertible. Function (5) is strictly decreasing on its entire domain, so invertible. Function (2) is a parabola, not invertible over its given domain.Therefore, the invertible functions are (3), (4), and (5). Their labels are 3, 4, 5. So, the product is 3 * 4 * 5 = 60.But wait, hold on. Let me check function (5) again. The function k(x) = 4/x is invertible, but sometimes people might confuse it with functions that aren't one-to-one. But in this case, since it's strictly decreasing over its entire domain, it's invertible.Wait, but sometimes when a function has asymptotes, people might think it's not invertible, but that's not the case. The key is whether it's one-to-one, which it is.So, yeah, I think I'm confident that functions (3), (4), and (5) are invertible, so the product is 60.**Final Answer**boxed{60}"},{"question":"Given a linear function y=frac{5}{3}x+2, when -3leqslant xleqslant 3, the maximum value of y is ____.","answer":"To determine the maximum value of the linear function ( y = frac{5}{3}x + 2 ) within the interval ( -3 leq x leq 3 ), I will evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval.First, I'll substitute ( x = -3 ) into the function:[y = frac{5}{3}(-3) + 2 = -5 + 2 = -3]Next, I'll substitute ( x = 3 ) into the function:[y = frac{5}{3}(3) + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7]Comparing the two results, the maximum value of ( y ) within the given interval is 7."},{"question":"Calculate |1-sqrt{3}|-sqrt{3}(sqrt{3}+1).","answer":"First, I recognize that the expression involves absolute value and square roots, so I'll need to handle each part carefully.I'll start by evaluating the absolute value term ( |1 - sqrt{3}| ).

The definitions are given as:- ( m = frac{a + 2}{a + 3} )- ( n = frac{a + 1}{a + 2} )- ( p = frac{a}{a + 1} )Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. Since ( a < -3 ), that means ( a ) is a negative number less than -3. So, ( a ) is something like -4, -5, etc. Maybe I can plug in a specific value for ( a ) to see how ( m ), ( n ), and ( p ) behave. But before I do that, maybe I should analyze the expressions algebraically.First, let's note that since ( a < -3 ), the denominators in each fraction are:- For ( m ): ( a + 3 ). Since ( a < -3 ), ( a + 3 < 0 ).- For ( n ): ( a + 2 ). Similarly, ( a + 2 < -1 ), so also negative.- For ( p ): ( a + 1 ). ( a + 1 < -2 ), so negative as well.So all denominators are negative. The numerators:- For ( m ): ( a + 2 ). Since ( a < -3 ), ( a + 2 < -1 ), so negative.- For ( n ): ( a + 1 ). ( a + 1 < -2 ), so negative.- For ( p ): ( a ). ( a ) is negative.So all numerators are negative, and all denominators are negative. Therefore, each fraction ( m ), ( n ), ( p ) is positive because a negative divided by a negative is positive. So, all three are positive numbers. Now, I need to figure out which one is the largest.Maybe I can compare them two at a time. Let's start by comparing ( m ) and ( n ).So, ( m = frac{a + 2}{a + 3} ) and ( n = frac{a + 1}{a + 2} ). Let's see which one is bigger.To compare ( m ) and ( n ), I can subtract them:( m - n = frac{a + 2}{a + 3} - frac{a + 1}{a + 2} )To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator, which would be ( (a + 3)(a + 2) ). So:( m - n = frac{(a + 2)^2 - (a + 1)(a + 3)}{(a + 3)(a + 2)} )Let me compute the numerator:( (a + 2)^2 = a^2 + 4a + 4 )( (a + 1)(a + 3) = a^2 + 4a + 3 )Subtracting the second from the first:( (a^2 + 4a + 4) - (a^2 + 4a + 3) = 1 )So, the numerator is 1, and the denominator is ( (a + 3)(a + 2) ). Since ( a < -3 ), both ( a + 3 ) and ( a + 2 ) are negative, so their product is positive. Therefore, ( m - n = frac{1}{text{positive}} = ) positive. So, ( m > n ).Okay, so ( m ) is greater than ( n ). Now, let's compare ( m ) and ( p ).( m = frac{a + 2}{a + 3} ) and ( p = frac{a}{a + 1} ).Again, subtract them:( m - p = frac{a + 2}{a + 3} - frac{a}{a + 1} )Common denominator is ( (a + 3)(a + 1) ):( m - p = frac{(a + 2)(a + 1) - a(a + 3)}{(a + 3)(a + 1)} )Compute numerator:( (a + 2)(a + 1) = a^2 + 3a + 2 )( a(a + 3) = a^2 + 3a )Subtracting:( (a^2 + 3a + 2) - (a^2 + 3a) = 2 )So numerator is 2, denominator is ( (a + 3)(a + 1) ). Again, ( a < -3 ), so ( a + 3 < 0 ) and ( a + 1 < -2 ), so denominator is positive. Therefore, ( m - p = frac{2}{text{positive}} = ) positive. So, ( m > p ).So, so far, ( m ) is greater than both ( n ) and ( p ). Therefore, ( m ) is the greatest.Wait, but let me just verify this with an example. Let me pick a value for ( a ) less than -3, say ( a = -4 ).Compute ( m = frac{-4 + 2}{-4 + 3} = frac{-2}{-1} = 2 )Compute ( n = frac{-4 + 1}{-4 + 2} = frac{-3}{-2} = 1.5 )Compute ( p = frac{-4}{-4 + 1} = frac{-4}{-3} approx 1.333 )So, indeed, ( m = 2 ) is greater than ( n = 1.5 ) and ( p approx 1.333 ). So, ( m ) is the greatest.Let me try another value, say ( a = -5 ):( m = frac{-5 + 2}{-5 + 3} = frac{-3}{-2} = 1.5 )( n = frac{-5 + 1}{-5 + 2} = frac{-4}{-3} approx 1.333 )( p = frac{-5}{-5 + 1} = frac{-5}{-4} = 1.25 )Again, ( m = 1.5 ) is greater than ( n approx 1.333 ) and ( p = 1.25 ).Wait a second, when ( a = -5 ), ( m = 1.5 ), which is still greater than ( n ) and ( p ). So, seems consistent.But just to make sure, let me try ( a = -10 ):( m = frac{-10 + 2}{-10 + 3} = frac{-8}{-7} approx 1.1429 )( n = frac{-10 + 1}{-10 + 2} = frac{-9}{-8} = 1.125 )( p = frac{-10}{-10 + 1} = frac{-10}{-9} approx 1.1111 )Again, ( m approx 1.1429 ) is greater than ( n = 1.125 ) and ( p approx 1.1111 ).So, in all these cases, ( m ) is the greatest. So, seems like ( m ) is always the greatest.But just to be thorough, let me try to see if this holds as ( a ) approaches negative infinity.As ( a ) becomes very large in magnitude negative, each of these fractions can be approximated.For ( m = frac{a + 2}{a + 3} approx frac{a}{a} = 1 ), but more precisely, it's ( 1 - frac{1}{a + 3} ). Since ( a ) is negative, ( a + 3 ) is negative, so ( frac{1}{a + 3} ) is negative, so ( m approx 1 + frac{1}{|a + 3|} ), which is slightly greater than 1.Similarly, ( n = frac{a + 1}{a + 2} approx 1 - frac{1}{a + 2} approx 1 + frac{1}{|a + 2|} ), which is slightly greater than 1, but since ( |a + 2| > |a + 3| ), the term ( frac{1}{|a + 2|} ) is smaller than ( frac{1}{|a + 3|} ). Therefore, ( m ) is slightly greater than ( n ).Similarly, ( p = frac{a}{a + 1} approx 1 - frac{1}{a + 1} approx 1 + frac{1}{|a + 1|} ). Since ( |a + 1| > |a + 2| > |a + 3| ), the term ( frac{1}{|a + 1|} ) is the smallest, so ( p ) is the closest to 1, making ( m > n > p ).Therefore, regardless of how large ( |a| ) is, as long as ( a < -3 ), ( m ) is the greatest.Wait, but let me think again. When ( a ) approaches -3 from the left, say ( a = -3.1 ):( m = frac{-3.1 + 2}{-3.1 + 3} = frac{-1.1}{-0.1} = 11 )( n = frac{-3.1 + 1}{-3.1 + 2} = frac{-2.1}{-1.1} approx 1.909 )( p = frac{-3.1}{-3.1 + 1} = frac{-3.1}{-2.1} approx 1.476 )Wow, so when ( a ) is just slightly less than -3, ( m ) becomes very large, approaching infinity as ( a ) approaches -3 from the left. So, in this case, ( m ) is way larger than ( n ) and ( p ).But when ( a ) is much less than -3, say ( a = -100 ):( m = frac{-100 + 2}{-100 + 3} = frac{-98}{-97} approx 1.0103 )( n = frac{-100 + 1}{-100 + 2} = frac{-99}{-98} approx 1.0102 )( p = frac{-100}{-100 + 1} = frac{-100}{-99} approx 1.0101 )So, here, ( m approx 1.0103 ), ( n approx 1.0102 ), ( p approx 1.0101 ). So, ( m ) is still the greatest, but only slightly.So, regardless of how close ( a ) is to -3 or how far it is, ( m ) is always the greatest. Therefore, the conclusion is that ( m ) is the greatest among ( m ), ( n ), and ( p ).Just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe cross-multiplying to compare the fractions.Comparing ( m ) and ( n ):( m = frac{a + 2}{a + 3} ) vs. ( n = frac{a + 1}{a + 2} )Cross-multiplying:( (a + 2)(a + 2) ) vs. ( (a + 1)(a + 3) )Which is ( (a + 2)^2 ) vs. ( (a + 1)(a + 3) )Compute both:( (a + 2)^2 = a^2 + 4a + 4 )( (a + 1)(a + 3) = a^2 + 4a + 3 )So, ( (a + 2)^2 - (a + 1)(a + 3) = 1 ), which is positive. Therefore, ( (a + 2)^2 > (a + 1)(a + 3) ), so ( m > n ).Similarly, comparing ( m ) and ( p ):( m = frac{a + 2}{a + 3} ) vs. ( p = frac{a}{a + 1} )Cross-multiplying:( (a + 2)(a + 1) ) vs. ( a(a + 3) )Compute both:( (a + 2)(a + 1) = a^2 + 3a + 2 )( a(a + 3) = a^2 + 3a )Subtracting:( (a^2 + 3a + 2) - (a^2 + 3a) = 2 ), which is positive. Therefore, ( (a + 2)(a + 1) > a(a + 3) ), so ( m > p ).Therefore, algebraically, ( m ) is greater than both ( n ) and ( p ). So, the conclusion is consistent.I think I've thoroughly checked this from multiple angles: algebraically, numerically with specific examples, and even considered the behavior as ( a ) approaches -3 and as ( a ) becomes very large in magnitude. In all cases, ( m ) comes out as the greatest. So, I feel confident that ( m ) is indeed the greatest among the three.**Final Answer**The greatest among ( m, n, p ) is boxed{m}."},{"question":"If you want to buy 40 bottles of Coca-Cola, each priced at 2.8 yuan, estimate how many 20-yuan banknotes are needed.

He drives 35 miles in the first hour, but realizes that he will be 1 hour late if he continues at this speed.

How many miles is the airport from his home?textbf{(A) }140qquad textbf{(B) }175qquad textbf{(C) }210qquad textbf{(D) }245qquad textbf{(E) }280qquad","answer":"Okay, so David is driving to the airport. In the first hour, he drives 35 miles. Hmm, that means his speed is 35 miles per hour during that first hour. But then he realizes that if he continues at this speed, he'll be 1 hour late. So, he decides to increase his speed by 15 mph for the rest of the trip and ends up arriving 30 minutes early. We need to find the total distance from his home to the airport.Let me break this down. Let's denote the total distance as D miles. He already drove 35 miles in the first hour, so the remaining distance is D - 35 miles.If he continues at 35 mph, he'll be 1 hour late. So, let's figure out how long it would take him to drive the remaining distance at 35 mph. The time would be (D - 35)/35 hours. So, the total time if he continues at 35 mph would be 1 hour (the first part) plus (D - 35)/35 hours. But this would make him 1 hour late.On the other hand, when he increases his speed by 15 mph, his new speed becomes 35 + 15 = 50 mph. So, the time taken for the remaining distance at 50 mph is (D - 35)/50 hours. Therefore, the total time he actually took is 1 hour plus (D - 35)/50 hours, and this made him arrive 30 minutes early.So, let's denote the scheduled time to reach the airport as T hours. Then, if he continues at 35 mph, his total time would be T + 1, and if he drives the rest at 50 mph, his total time is T - 0.5.So, we can set up two equations based on these scenarios.First scenario: Total time at 35 mph for the remaining distance is T + 1.So, 1 + (D - 35)/35 = T + 1.Wait, hold on, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.Actually, the scheduled time T is the time he is supposed to take to reach on time. So, if he drives the first hour at 35 mph, and then continues at 35 mph, he would take longer than scheduled, specifically 1 hour more. So, the total time in that case is T + 1.Similarly, when he increases his speed, his total time is T - 0.5.So, let's write the equations.First, the time if he continues at 35 mph:Total time = 1 + (D - 35)/35 = T + 1.Wait, that can't be right because if he continues at 35 mph, the total time is 1 + (D - 35)/35, which is equal to T + 1. So, that equation is:1 + (D - 35)/35 = T + 1.Simplify this: subtract 1 from both sides, we get (D - 35)/35 = T.So, T = (D - 35)/35.Second scenario: he drives the first hour at 35 mph, then the rest at 50 mph, arriving 30 minutes early. So, total time is 1 + (D - 35)/50 = T - 0.5.So, we have two equations:1. T = (D - 35)/352. 1 + (D - 35)/50 = T - 0.5Now, substitute T from the first equation into the second equation.So, 1 + (D - 35)/50 = (D - 35)/35 - 0.5Let me write this out:1 + (D - 35)/50 = (D - 35)/35 - 0.5Now, let's solve for D.First, let's get rid of the fractions by finding a common denominator. The denominators are 50 and 35. The least common multiple of 50 and 35 is 350.Multiply every term by 350 to eliminate denominators:350*1 + 350*(D - 35)/50 = 350*(D - 35)/35 - 350*0.5Simplify each term:350*1 = 350350*(D - 35)/50 = 7*(D - 35) because 350/50 = 7350*(D - 35)/35 = 10*(D - 35) because 350/35 = 10350*0.5 = 175So, substituting back:350 + 7*(D - 35) = 10*(D - 35) - 175Now, let's expand the terms:350 + 7D - 245 = 10D - 350 - 175Simplify both sides:Left side: 350 - 245 = 105, so 105 + 7DRight side: 10D - 350 - 175 = 10D - 525So, equation becomes:105 + 7D = 10D - 525Let's bring all terms to one side. Subtract 7D from both sides:105 = 3D - 525Add 525 to both sides:105 + 525 = 3D630 = 3DDivide both sides by 3:D = 210So, the total distance is 210 miles.Wait, let me verify this because 210 is one of the options, option C.Let me check the calculations again to make sure.So, D = 210.First hour: 35 miles, so remaining distance is 210 - 35 = 175 miles.If he continued at 35 mph, time taken for remaining distance is 175 / 35 = 5 hours. So total time would be 1 + 5 = 6 hours. He would be 1 hour late, so scheduled time T is 6 - 1 = 5 hours.Alternatively, when he increases speed to 50 mph, time taken for remaining distance is 175 / 50 = 3.5 hours. So total time is 1 + 3.5 = 4.5 hours, which is 30 minutes early, so scheduled time is 4.5 + 0.5 = 5 hours. That matches.So, yes, D = 210 is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Let P be a point in coordinate space, where all the coordinates of P are positive.

Direction cosines are the cosines of the angles that a line makes with each of the coordinate axes.

Yeah, I think that's correct because it's related to the fact that the vector is a unit vector when normalized.So, if that's the case, I can plug in the known values of cos α and cos β and solve for cos γ.Let me write that down:cos² α + cos² β + cos² γ = 1Plugging in the given values:(1/3)² + (1/5)² + cos² γ = 1Calculating each term:1/9 + 1/25 + cos² γ = 1Now, I need to compute 1/9 + 1/25. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 25 is 225.So, 1/9 is equal to 25/225, and 1/25 is equal to 9/225. Adding them together:25/225 + 9/225 = 34/225So, now the equation becomes:34/225 + cos² γ = 1Subtracting 34/225 from both sides:cos² γ = 1 - 34/225Calculating 1 as 225/225:cos² γ = 225/225 - 34/225 = 191/225Therefore, cos γ is the square root of 191/225. Since all coordinates of P are positive, the angle γ is between 0 and 90 degrees, so cos γ is positive.So, cos γ = sqrt(191)/15.Wait, let me double-check that. sqrt(191) is approximately 13.82, and 15 is 15, so sqrt(191)/15 is approximately 0.921, which is less than 1, so that makes sense.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations:1. Direction cosines: yes, cos α = x/|OP|, etc.2. Sum of squares: yes, cos² α + cos² β + cos² γ = 1.3. Plugging in 1/3 and 1/5: correct.4. Calculating 1/9 + 1/25: 25/225 + 9/225 = 34/225. Correct.5. 1 - 34/225 = 191/225. Correct.6. Square root of 191/225 is sqrt(191)/15. Correct.So, I think that's the right answer. Let me just write it in LaTeX.**Final Answer**boxed{dfrac{sqrt{191}}{15}}"},{"question":"In a certain ellipse, the center is at (-3,1), one focus is at (-3,0), and one endpoint of a semi-major axis is at (-3,3).  Find the semi-minor axis of the ellipse.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an ellipse, and I need to find the semi-minor axis. Let me try to remember what I know about ellipses. An ellipse is like a stretched-out circle, right? It has a center, two foci, and major and minor axes. The major axis is the longest diameter, and the minor axis is the shortest diameter. The semi-major axis is half of the major axis, and the semi-minor axis is half of the minor axis.The problem gives me the center of the ellipse, which is at (-3, 1). That's good to know because it tells me where the ellipse is located on the coordinate plane. Then it says one focus is at (-3, 0). Hmm, so the focus is also at (-3, something). That means the major axis must be vertical because both the center and the focus have the same x-coordinate. If the major axis were horizontal, the focus would have the same y-coordinate as the center but a different x-coordinate.Next, it mentions one endpoint of a semi-major axis is at (-3, 3). So, the semi-major axis goes from the center to this point. Let me visualize this. The center is at (-3, 1), and the endpoint is at (-3, 3). So, moving from the center to ( -3, 3), that's a distance of 2 units upwards. Since this is the endpoint of the semi-major axis, that means the length of the semi-major axis, usually denoted as 'a', is 2. So, a = 2.Now, I remember that in an ellipse, the distance from the center to each focus is denoted as 'c'. So, let's find 'c'. The center is at (-3, 1), and the focus is at (-3, 0). The distance between these two points is the absolute difference in the y-coordinates because the x-coordinates are the same. So, |1 - 0| = 1. Therefore, c = 1.I also recall that in an ellipse, the relationship between a, b (the semi-minor axis), and c is given by the equation:a² = b² + c²Wait, no, actually, it's c² = a² - b². Let me double-check that. Yes, since c is the distance from the center to the focus, and a is the semi-major axis, then c² = a² - b². So, rearranging that, we can solve for b²:b² = a² - c²We already know that a = 2 and c = 1, so let's plug those values in:b² = (2)² - (1)² = 4 - 1 = 3Therefore, b = sqrt(3). So, the semi-minor axis is sqrt(3). Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here.First, the center is at (-3, 1). The focus is at (-3, 0), so the distance c is 1. The endpoint of the semi-major axis is at (-3, 3), so the distance from the center is 2, which is a. Then, using the formula c² = a² - b², we get 1 = 4 - b², so b² = 3, so b = sqrt(3). That seems right.Wait, just to be thorough, let me think about the orientation of the ellipse. Since the major axis is vertical, the major axis is along the y-axis direction. So, the standard form of the ellipse equation would be:((x - h)²)/b² + ((y - k)²)/a² = 1Where (h, k) is the center. So, plugging in the values, it would be:((x + 3)²)/b² + ((y - 1)²)/4 = 1And since c² = a² - b², we have 1 = 4 - b², so b² = 3. Therefore, b is sqrt(3). So, yes, that's consistent.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the semi-minor axis is sqrt(3).**Final Answer**The semi-minor axis of the ellipse is boxed{sqrt{3}}."},{"question":"Several natural numbers were written on the board, with the difference between any two neighboring numbers being the same. Kolya replaced different digits with different letters, and identical digits with identical letters. Restore the original numbers if the following are written on the board: Т, ЕЛ, ЕК, ЛА, СС.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where several natural numbers were written on the board, and the difference between any two neighboring numbers is the same. That means it's an arithmetic sequence, right? So, the numbers increase by a constant difference each time.Kolya replaced different digits with different letters and identical digits with identical letters. So, each letter represents a unique digit, and the same letter represents the same digit throughout. The numbers written on the board are: Т, ЕЛ, ЕК, ЛА, СС.First, let me note down the given numbers:1. Т2. ЕЛ3. ЕК4. ЛА5. ССEach of these is a number, with the first one being a single-digit number, and the rest being two-digit numbers.Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote the common difference as 'd'. So, the sequence is:Term 1: ТTerm 2: Т + d = ЕЛTerm 3: ЕЛ + d = ЕКTerm 4: ЕК + d = ЛАTerm 5: ЛА + d = ССSo, each subsequent term is the previous term plus d.Given that these are numbers, each term must be a valid number with digits represented by the given letters.Let me assign variables to each letter:Let’s denote:Т = tЕ = eЛ = lК = kА = aС = sSo, the terms become:1. t2. 10e + l3. 10e + k4. 10l + a5. 10s + s = 11sSo, the sequence is:t, 10e + l, 10e + k, 10l + a, 11sAnd the differences between consecutive terms are equal, so:(10e + l) - t = d(10e + k) - (10e + l) = k - l = d(10l + a) - (10e + k) = 10l + a - 10e - k = d11s - (10l + a) = dSo, we have four expressions for d:1. d = 10e + l - t2. d = k - l3. d = 10l + a - 10e - k4. d = 11s - 10l - aSince all these equal d, they must equal each other.So, let's set them equal:From 1 and 2:10e + l - t = k - lSo, 10e + l - t = k - lLet me rearrange:10e + l - t - k + l = 010e + 2l - t - k = 0Equation A: 10e + 2l = t + kFrom 2 and 3:k - l = 10l + a - 10e - kBring all terms to left:k - l - 10l - a + 10e + k = 02k - 11l - a + 10e = 0Equation B: 10e + 2k = 11l + aFrom 3 and 4:10l + a - 10e - k = 11s - 10l - aBring all terms to left:10l + a - 10e - k - 11s + 10l + a = 020l + 2a - 10e - k - 11s = 0Equation C: 20l + 2a - 10e - k = 11sSo now we have three equations:A: 10e + 2l = t + kB: 10e + 2k = 11l + aC: 20l + 2a - 10e - k = 11sAlso, remember that all letters represent unique digits, so t, e, l, k, a, s are all distinct digits from 0 to 9.Additionally, since these are numbers, the first digit cannot be zero. So, t, e, l, a, s cannot be zero.So, t, e, l, k, a, s ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, and all distinct.Also, the numbers on the board are:t (single-digit), 10e + l, 10e + k, 10l + a, 11s.So, let's think about the possible values.First, term 1 is t, a single-digit number. Term 2 is 10e + l, which is a two-digit number. So, t must be less than 10e + l.Similarly, term 5 is 11s, which is a two-digit number, so s must be at least 1, making 11s at least 11.So, the sequence is increasing, as each term is the previous plus d.So, t < 10e + l < 10e + k < 10l + a < 11s.So, t is a single-digit number, and 10e + l is a two-digit number, so t must be less than 10e + l.Which is obvious because t is single-digit and 10e + l is two-digit.So, let's see if we can find possible values.Let me think about the differences.From equation 2: d = k - lSo, d must be equal to k - l.Since d is a positive integer (as the sequence is increasing), k > l.So, k = l + d.Also, from equation 1: d = 10e + l - tSo, t = 10e + l - dBut since t is a single-digit number, t must be less than 10.So, 10e + l - d < 10Which implies that d > 10e + l - 10But since d is positive, and e is at least 1, 10e is at least 10, so 10e + l is at least 11.So, 10e + l - d < 10 => d > 10e + l - 10But since d = k - l, and k = l + d, so k = l + d.So, substituting into equation A: 10e + 2l = t + kBut k = l + d, so:10e + 2l = t + l + dSimplify:10e + l = t + dBut from equation 1: d = 10e + l - tSo, substituting d into the above equation:10e + l = t + (10e + l - t)Which simplifies to 10e + l = 10e + lSo, that's an identity, which doesn't give us new information.So, moving on.From equation B: 10e + 2k = 11l + aBut k = l + d, so:10e + 2(l + d) = 11l + aSimplify:10e + 2l + 2d = 11l + aBring terms to left:10e + 2d = 9l + aEquation B1: 10e + 2d = 9l + aFrom equation C: 20l + 2a - 10e - k = 11sAgain, k = l + d, so:20l + 2a - 10e - (l + d) = 11sSimplify:19l + 2a - 10e - d = 11sEquation C1: 19l + 2a - 10e - d = 11sSo, now we have equations B1 and C1.Equation B1: 10e + 2d = 9l + aEquation C1: 19l + 2a - 10e - d = 11sLet me try to express a from equation B1:From B1: a = 10e + 2d - 9lSubstitute a into C1:19l + 2(10e + 2d - 9l) - 10e - d = 11sSimplify:19l + 20e + 4d - 18l - 10e - d = 11sCombine like terms:(19l - 18l) + (20e - 10e) + (4d - d) = 11sSo:l + 10e + 3d = 11sEquation D: l + 10e + 3d = 11sSo, now we have equation D: l + 10e + 3d = 11sAlso, from equation 1: d = 10e + l - tBut t is a single-digit number, so t = 10e + l - d < 10So, 10e + l - d < 10 => d > 10e + l - 10But d is positive, so 10e + l - d must be positive as well because t is a natural number.So, 10e + l - d ≥ 1So, d ≤ 10e + l - 1So, d is between (10e + l - 10) and (10e + l - 1)But since d must be an integer, let's see.Also, from equation 2: d = k - l, and k and l are digits, so d must be less than 9 (since k and l are digits from 1-9, and k > l, so maximum d is 8 (if k=9, l=1))So, d ∈ {1,2,...,8}Also, from equation D: l + 10e + 3d = 11sSince s is a digit, 11s is between 11 and 99.So, l + 10e + 3d must be between 11 and 99.But l and e are digits from 1-9, so l + 10e is at least 11 (if e=1, l=1) and at most 99 (if e=9, l=9). But 3d is at least 3 and at most 24.So, l + 10e + 3d is between 14 and 123, but since 11s is at most 99, l + 10e + 3d ≤ 99.So, l + 10e + 3d ≤ 99.Also, s must be a digit, so s = (l + 10e + 3d)/11 must be an integer.So, l + 10e + 3d must be divisible by 11.So, (l + 10e + 3d) mod 11 = 0Which is equivalent to (l + 10e + 3d) ≡ 0 mod 11Let me note that 10 ≡ -1 mod 11, so 10e ≡ -e mod 11Similarly, 3d ≡ 3d mod 11So, l - e + 3d ≡ 0 mod 11So, l - e + 3d ≡ 0 mod 11Which gives:l ≡ e - 3d mod 11Since l and e are digits from 1-9, and d is from 1-8, let's see possible values.So, l = e - 3d + 11k, where k is integer.But since l must be between 1 and 9, let's see possible k.If k=0: l = e - 3dBut e and d are positive integers, so e - 3d must be at least 1.But since d is at least 1, 3d is at least 3, so e must be at least 4 for l to be positive.But e is a digit from 1-9, so e can be 4-9.But let's check if l = e - 3d is between 1-9.If k=1: l = e - 3d + 11Since l must be ≤9, e - 3d +11 ≤9 => e -3d ≤ -2 => e ≤ 3d -2But e is at least 1, so 3d -2 ≥1 => d ≥1, which is always true.But e must be ≤3d -2.Given that e is a digit, 3d -2 must be ≤9 => 3d ≤11 => d ≤3 (since d is integer)So, if d=1: e ≤1, but e is at least 1, so e=1Then l =1 -3*1 +11=9So, l=9Similarly, d=2: e ≤4So, e can be 1,2,3,4Then l= e -6 +11= e +5So, l would be e+5, which must be ≤9, so e ≤4So, e=1: l=6e=2: l=7e=3: l=8e=4: l=9d=3: e ≤7So, l=e -9 +11=e +2Which must be ≤9, so e ≤7So, e=1: l=3e=2: l=4e=3: l=5e=4: l=6e=5: l=7e=6: l=8e=7: l=9d=4: e ≤10, but e is a digit, so e=1-9But l=e -12 +11=e -1Which must be ≥1, so e≥2So, e=2: l=1e=3: l=2...e=9: l=8But l must be unique, so we have to check for uniqueness.But let's see, for each d, we can have possible e and l.But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to try possible values for d.Since d is from 1-8, let's try each d and see if we can find suitable e and l.Starting with d=1:From equation D: l +10e +3*1=11s => l +10e +3=11sAlso, from equation l ≡ e -3*1 mod11 => l ≡ e -3 mod11But l and e are digits, so l = e -3 or l = e -3 +11But l must be between 1-9.Case 1: l = e -3Then, since l ≥1, e must be ≥4So, e=4: l=1e=5: l=2e=6: l=3e=7: l=4e=8: l=5e=9: l=6Then, from equation D: l +10e +3=11sSo, let's compute l +10e +3 for each e:e=4, l=1: 1 +40 +3=44=11*4 => s=4But e=4 and s=4 would conflict since all letters must represent different digits. So, invalid.e=5, l=2: 2 +50 +3=55=11*5 => s=5Again, e=5 and s=5 conflict. Invalid.e=6, l=3: 3 +60 +3=66=11*6 => s=6Conflict between e=6 and s=6. Invalid.e=7, l=4:4 +70 +3=77=11*7 => s=7Conflict between e=7 and s=7. Invalid.e=8, l=5:5 +80 +3=88=11*8 => s=8Conflict between e=8 and s=8. Invalid.e=9, l=6:6 +90 +3=99=11*9 => s=9Conflict between e=9 and s=9. Invalid.So, all cases for d=1 lead to conflict between e and s. So, d=1 is invalid.Case 2: l = e -3 +11= e +8But l must be ≤9, so e +8 ≤9 => e ≤1But e is at least 1, so e=1, l=9Then, from equation D: l +10e +3=9 +10 +3=22=11*2 => s=2So, s=2Now, check uniqueness: e=1, l=9, s=2, d=1So far, digits used:1,2,9Now, let's see if we can find other digits.From equation A:10e +2l = t +ke=1, l=9: 10*1 +2*9=10+18=28= t +kSo, t +k=28But t is a single-digit number, so t ≤9, so k=28 -t ≥19But k is a digit, so k ≤9.

Form the equationC_{10}^{7} p^{7} q^{3}=C_{10}^{6} p^{6} q^{4}from which it follows: 120 p=210 q ; frac{p}{q}=frac{7}{4} ; p=frac{7}{11}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem here. It says that the probabilities of getting heads and tails are p and q respectively, where q is 1 minus p. Then, it forms an equation using combinations:C(10,7) * p^7 * q^3 = C(10,6) * p^6 * q^4From this equation, it follows that 120p = 210q, then p/q = 7/4, and finally p = 7/11.Hmm, let me try to understand how they got from the equation to the value of p. I think this is related to binomial probabilities, right? Because we're dealing with combinations and powers of p and q.First, let me recall that C(n,k) is the combination formula, which is n! / (k!(n - k)!).So, C(10,7) is 10! / (7! * 3!) and C(10,6) is 10! / (6! * 4!). Let me compute those values.C(10,7) = 10! / (7! * 3!) = (10*9*8)/(3*2*1) = 120.Similarly, C(10,6) = 10! / (6! * 4!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.Okay, so the equation becomes:120 * p^7 * q^3 = 210 * p^6 * q^4Now, I need to solve for p. Let me try to simplify this equation.First, I can divide both sides by p^6 to reduce the exponents:120 * p^(7-6) * q^3 = 210 * q^4Which simplifies to:120 * p * q^3 = 210 * q^4Now, I can divide both sides by q^3, assuming q is not zero, which makes sense because if q were zero, we wouldn't have any tails, and the problem wouldn't make much sense.So, dividing both sides by q^3:120 * p = 210 * qNow, I can write this as:120p = 210qI can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 30:(120/30)p = (210/30)qWhich simplifies to:4p = 7qSo, 4p = 7q.But since q is 1 - p, I can substitute q with (1 - p):4p = 7(1 - p)Let me expand the right side:4p = 7 - 7pNow, I can bring all the p terms to one side:4p + 7p = 7Which gives:11p = 7So, solving for p:p = 7/11Alright, that makes sense. So, p is 7/11. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Calculated C(10,7) and C(10,6) correctly: 120 and 210. That seems right.2. Plugged them into the equation: 120p^7q^3 = 210p^6q^4. Correct.3. Divided both sides by p^6: 120p q^3 = 210 q^4. That seems fine.4. Divided both sides by q^3: 120p = 210 q. Yes, as long as q ≠ 0, which it isn't.5. Simplified 120p = 210q by dividing both sides by 30: 4p = 7q. Correct.6. Substituted q with (1 - p): 4p = 7(1 - p). That's right.7. Expanded and solved for p: 4p = 7 - 7p → 11p = 7 → p = 7/11. Perfect.So, all the steps check out. Therefore, p is indeed 7/11. I think that's the correct answer.Just to make sure, let me think about the context. This equation is equating the probabilities of getting 7 heads and 3 tails to getting 6 heads and 4 tails in 10 trials. So, it's like saying the probability of 7 heads is equal to the probability of 6 heads. That happens when p is greater than 0.5, which 7/11 is approximately 0.636, so that makes sense. If p were 0.5, the probabilities would be equal at the middle term, but since we're equating 7 and 6, p has to be higher to make the 7 heads probability catch up with the 6 heads probability. So, 7/11 is reasonable.Another way to think about it is that the ratio of p to q is 7 to 4, which is 7/11 to 4/11. So, p is 7/11, which is more than half, as expected.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The probability ( p ) is boxed{dfrac{7}{11}}."},{"question":"Given is a rectangle with perimeter  x  cm and side lengths in a  1:2  ratio. Suppose that the area of the rectangle is also  x   text{cm}^2 . Determine all possible values of  x .","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a rectangle. The perimeter is x cm, and the sides are in a 1:2 ratio. Also, the area is x cm². I need to find all possible values of x. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the rectangle. Since the sides are in a 1:2 ratio, that means one side is twice as long as the other. Let me denote the shorter side as 'a' cm. Then, the longer side would be '2a' cm. So, the sides are a and 2a.Now, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). In this case, that would be 2*(a + 2a). Let me compute that:Perimeter = 2*(a + 2a) = 2*(3a) = 6a cm.But the problem says the perimeter is x cm. So, 6a = x. That gives me a relationship between a and x: a = x/6.Okay, moving on to the area. The area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width, so that would be a * 2a. Let me calculate that:Area = a * 2a = 2a² cm².But the problem also states that the area is x cm². So, 2a² = x.Now, I have two equations:1. 6a = x2. 2a² = xSince both equal x, I can set them equal to each other:6a = 2a²Hmm, okay, let me write that as:2a² - 6a = 0I can factor out a 2a:2a(a - 3) = 0So, this gives me two solutions:Either 2a = 0 => a = 0, or (a - 3) = 0 => a = 3.But a = 0 doesn't make sense in this context because the side length can't be zero. So, we discard that solution.Therefore, a = 3 cm.Now, let me find x using the perimeter equation:x = 6a = 6*3 = 18 cm.Wait, let me double-check with the area to make sure:Area = 2a² = 2*(3)² = 2*9 = 18 cm².Yes, that matches the given condition that the area is x cm². So, x is indeed 18.But hold on, the problem says \\"determine all possible values of x.\\" So, is 18 the only solution?Looking back at my equations, when I set 6a = 2a², I got a quadratic equation which had two roots: a = 0 and a = 3. Since a = 0 is not feasible, only a = 3 is valid. Therefore, x can only be 18 cm.Wait, but let me think again. Quadratic equations can sometimes have two positive roots, but in this case, the other root was zero, which isn't positive. So, yeah, only one solution.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently to confirm.Let me denote the sides as a and 2a again. Perimeter is 2(a + 2a) = 6a = x. Area is a*2a = 2a² = x.So, substituting x from the perimeter into the area equation:2a² = 6aDivide both sides by 2:a² = 3aBring all terms to one side:a² - 3a = 0Factor:a(a - 3) = 0So, a = 0 or a = 3. Again, same result. So, x = 6a = 18.Therefore, x must be 18 cm.Wait, but just to be thorough, is there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, sometimes ratio problems can have different interpretations, but in this case, it's pretty straightforward: sides are in a 1:2 ratio, so one is twice the other.Alternatively, if I consider the sides as 2a and a, but that's the same as before. So, no difference.Another thought: could there be negative lengths? But lengths can't be negative, so we only consider positive solutions.So, yeah, I think 18 is the only possible value for x.Wait, but let me just plug it back into the original problem to make sure.Perimeter is 18 cm. So, sides are a = 3 cm and 2a = 6 cm. Perimeter is 2*(3 + 6) = 2*9 = 18 cm. Area is 3*6 = 18 cm². Yep, that's correct.So, x is 18. I don't think there's any other value that satisfies both conditions.Therefore, the only possible value of x is 18.**Final Answer**The possible value of ( x ) is boxed{18}."},{"question":"The coefficient of x^3 in the expansion of (2x+1)^5 is.","answer":"To find the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in the expansion of ( (2x + 1)^5 ), I can use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that ( (a + b)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k ).In this case, ( a = 2x ), ( b = 1 ), and ( n = 5 ). I need to find the term where the power of ( x ) is 3, which corresponds to ( k = 3 ) in the expansion.First, I calculate the binomial coefficient ( binom{5}{3} ), which is 10. Then, I raise ( 2x ) to the power of ( 5 - 3 = 2 ), resulting in ( (2x)^2 = 4x^2 ). Next, I raise ( 1 ) to the power of 3, which is 1.Multiplying these together, the term is ( 10 times 4x^2 times 1 = 40x^2 ). However, this term corresponds to ( x^2 ), not ( x^3 ).

And I need to find the sum of a₀, a₁, a₂, and a₃. Hmm, that sounds like it's related to expanding a polynomial around a point, maybe using Taylor series or something like that.Let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:x³ = a₀ + a₁(x - 2) + a₂(x - 2)² + a₃(x - 2)³.So, I need to find the coefficients a₀, a₁, a₂, a₃ such that this equation holds for all real numbers x. Then, once I have those coefficients, I can just add them up to get the answer.I remember that when you have a polynomial expressed in terms of (x - c), it's called the Taylor series expansion around the point c. In this case, c is 2. So, maybe I can expand x³ around x = 2 and find the coefficients a₀, a₁, a₂, a₃.Alternatively, another approach is to substitute specific values of x into the equation to create a system of equations and solve for the coefficients. Since the equation holds for all x, it should hold for specific x values as well. Maybe plugging in x = 2 would simplify things because (x - 2) becomes zero, which might help me find a₀.Let me try that. If I set x = 2, the equation becomes:2³ = a₀ + a₁(0) + a₂(0)² + a₃(0)³.So, 8 = a₀. Okay, so a₀ is 8. That was straightforward.Now, I need to find a₁, a₂, a₃. Hmm, maybe I can take derivatives of both sides and evaluate them at x = 2. Because in Taylor series, the coefficients are related to the derivatives at the expansion point.Let me recall that the Taylor series expansion of a function f(x) around x = c is:f(x) = f(c) + f’(c)(x - c) + (f''(c)/2!)(x - c)² + (f'''(c)/3!)(x - c)³ + ... So, in this case, f(x) is x³, c is 2. So, let's compute the derivatives.First, f(x) = x³.f(2) = 8, which we already have as a₀.f’(x) = 3x². So, f’(2) = 3*(2)² = 12. In the Taylor series, the coefficient of (x - 2) is f’(2)/1! = 12/1 = 12. So, a₁ should be 12.Next, f''(x) = 6x. So, f''(2) = 6*2 = 12. The coefficient of (x - 2)² in the Taylor series is f''(2)/2! = 12/2 = 6. So, a₂ is 6.Then, f'''(x) = 6. So, f'''(2) = 6. The coefficient of (x - 2)³ is f'''(2)/3! = 6/6 = 1. So, a₃ is 1.Therefore, the coefficients are a₀ = 8, a₁ = 12, a₂ = 6, a₃ = 1. So, adding them up: 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify it another way just to be sure.Another method is to expand the right-hand side and compare coefficients with the left-hand side. Let's try that.First, expand (x - 2)³:(x - 2)³ = x³ - 6x² + 12x - 8.Then, (x - 2)² = x² - 4x + 4.And (x - 2) is just x - 2.So, let's write the right-hand side:a₀ + a₁(x - 2) + a₂(x - 2)² + a₃(x - 2)³= a₀ + a₁(x - 2) + a₂(x² - 4x + 4) + a₃(x³ - 6x² + 12x - 8)Now, let's expand each term:= a₀ + a₁x - 2a₁ + a₂x² - 4a₂x + 4a₂ + a₃x³ - 6a₃x² + 12a₃x - 8a₃Now, let's collect like terms:- The x³ term: a₃x³- The x² term: a₂x² - 6a₃x² = (a₂ - 6a₃)x²- The x term: a₁x - 4a₂x + 12a₃x = (a₁ - 4a₂ + 12a₃)x- The constant term: a₀ - 2a₁ + 4a₂ - 8a₃So, putting it all together:Right-hand side = a₃x³ + (a₂ - 6a₃)x² + (a₁ - 4a₂ + 12a₃)x + (a₀ - 2a₁ + 4a₂ - 8a₃)Now, the left-hand side is x³. So, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of x.So, for x³: 1 = a₃For x²: 0 = a₂ - 6a₃For x: 0 = a₁ - 4a₂ + 12a₃For the constant term: 0 = a₀ - 2a₁ + 4a₂ - 8a₃So, now we have a system of equations:1. a₃ = 12. a₂ - 6a₃ = 03. a₁ - 4a₂ + 12a₃ = 04. a₀ - 2a₁ + 4a₂ - 8a₃ = 0We already found a₀ earlier by plugging in x = 2, which gave a₀ = 8. Let's see if that holds here.From equation 1: a₃ = 1From equation 2: a₂ = 6a₃ = 6*1 = 6From equation 3: a₁ = 4a₂ - 12a₃ = 4*6 - 12*1 = 24 - 12 = 12From equation 4: a₀ = 2a₁ - 4a₂ + 8a₃ = 2*12 - 4*6 + 8*1 = 24 - 24 + 8 = 8So, that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, a₀ = 8, a₁ = 12, a₂ = 6, a₃ = 1.Therefore, a₀ + a₁ + a₂ + a₃ = 8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27.Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can plug in another value of x into the original equation and see if it holds.Let me choose x = 3.Left-hand side: 3³ = 27.Right-hand side: a₀ + a₁(3 - 2) + a₂(3 - 2)² + a₃(3 - 2)³ = a₀ + a₁(1) + a₂(1) + a₃(1) = a₀ + a₁ + a₂ + a₃ = 27.Which matches the left-hand side. So that's a good check.Alternatively, let's try x = 1.Left-hand side: 1³ = 1.Right-hand side: a₀ + a₁(1 - 2) + a₂(1 - 2)² + a₃(1 - 2)³ = a₀ - a₁ + a₂ - a₃.Plugging in the values: 8 - 12 + 6 - 1 = 8 -12 is -4, -4 +6 is 2, 2 -1 is 1. Which matches the left-hand side. So that's another check.Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficients are correct, and their sum is 27.**Final Answer**The value of (a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3) is boxed{27}."},{"question":"Three people, A, B, and C, independently attempt to crack a code. Their respective probabilities of success are frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{5}, and frac{3}{4}. Find:  (1) The probability that exactly one person succeeds when all three attempt to crack the code simultaneously;  (2) The probability that the code is successfully cracked when all three attempt it simultaneously;  (3) The minimum number of people like C required to ensure the probability of successfully cracking the code is at least 95%.","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem with three people, A, B, and C, trying to crack a code. Their success probabilities are given as 1/2, 3/5, and 3/4 respectively. There are three parts to the problem, and I need to figure each one out step by step.Starting with part (1): The probability that exactly one person succeeds when all three attempt to crack the code simultaneously.Hmm, okay. So, exactly one person succeeds means either A succeeds and B and C fail, or B succeeds and A and C fail, or C succeeds and A and B fail. Since these are independent events, I can calculate each scenario and then add them up.Let me write down the probabilities:- Probability A succeeds: P(A) = 1/2- Probability B succeeds: P(B) = 3/5- Probability C succeeds: P(C) = 3/4So, the probability that exactly one person succeeds is:P(exactly one) = P(A succeeds, B fails, C fails) + P(B succeeds, A fails, C fails) + P(C succeeds, A fails, B fails)Calculating each term:1. P(A succeeds, B fails, C fails) = P(A) * (1 - P(B)) * (1 - P(C))   = (1/2) * (1 - 3/5) * (1 - 3/4)   = (1/2) * (2/5) * (1/4)   = (1/2) * (2/5) * (1/4)   Let me compute that: 1/2 is 0.5, 2/5 is 0.4, 1/4 is 0.25. Multiplying together: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2; 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.05. So that's 1/20.2. P(B succeeds, A fails, C fails) = (1 - P(A)) * P(B) * (1 - P(C))   = (1 - 1/2) * (3/5) * (1 - 3/4)   = (1/2) * (3/5) * (1/4)   Let me compute that: 1/2 is 0.5, 3/5 is 0.6, 1/4 is 0.25. So, 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3; 0.3 * 0.25 = 0.075. That's 3/40.3. P(C succeeds, A fails, B fails) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) * P(C)   = (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 3/5) * (3/4)   = (1/2) * (2/5) * (3/4)   Calculating: 1/2 is 0.5, 2/5 is 0.4, 3/4 is 0.75. So, 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2; 0.2 * 0.75 = 0.15. That's 3/20.Now, adding all three probabilities together:1/20 + 3/40 + 3/20First, let me convert them all to 40 denominators:1/20 = 2/403/40 = 3/403/20 = 6/40So, 2/40 + 3/40 + 6/40 = 11/40So, the probability that exactly one person succeeds is 11/40. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First term: (1/2)*(2/5)*(1/4) = (1*2*1)/(2*5*4) = 2/40 = 1/20. Correct.Second term: (1/2)*(3/5)*(1/4) = (1*3*1)/(2*5*4) = 3/40. Correct.Third term: (1/2)*(2/5)*(3/4) = (1*2*3)/(2*5*4) = 6/40 = 3/20. Correct.Adding them: 1/20 + 3/40 + 3/20 = 2/40 + 3/40 + 6/40 = 11/40. Yep, that seems right.Moving on to part (2): The probability that the code is successfully cracked when all three attempt it simultaneously.So, this is the probability that at least one person succeeds. It might be easier to calculate the complement: the probability that all three fail, and then subtract that from 1.Calculating the probability that all three fail:P(all fail) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) * (1 - P(C))= (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 3/5) * (1 - 3/4)= (1/2) * (2/5) * (1/4)= (1/2) * (2/5) * (1/4)Calculating that: 1/2 is 0.5, 2/5 is 0.4, 1/4 is 0.25.0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2; 0.2 * 0.25 = 0.05. So, 1/20.Therefore, the probability that the code is successfully cracked is:1 - P(all fail) = 1 - 1/20 = 19/20.Wait, let me verify that.Alternatively, I could calculate the probability that at least one succeeds by considering all possible success cases: exactly one, exactly two, or all three. But that would involve more calculations. Since the complement is easier, I think my approach is correct.So, P(success) = 1 - (1/2)*(2/5)*(1/4) = 1 - (1/20) = 19/20. That seems correct.Alternatively, if I compute it directly:P(at least one success) = 1 - P(all fail) = 1 - (1/2)*(2/5)*(1/4) = 1 - (1/20) = 19/20.Yes, that's 0.95. So, 19/20 is 0.95. That seems high, but considering each person has a decent chance, especially C with 3/4, it's plausible.Wait, let me think again: If all three are trying, the chance that at least one succeeds is 19/20? That seems correct because the chance that all fail is 1/20.Yes, that seems right.Moving on to part (3): The minimum number of people like C required to ensure the probability of successfully cracking the code is at least 95%.Hmm, so we need to find the smallest number n such that when n people, each with success probability 3/4, attempt to crack the code independently, the probability that at least one succeeds is at least 95%.So, the probability that at least one succeeds is 1 - (probability that all fail). Each person has a probability of failure 1 - 3/4 = 1/4. So, for n people, the probability that all fail is (1/4)^n. Therefore, the probability that at least one succeeds is 1 - (1/4)^n.We need this probability to be at least 95%, which is 0.95.So, 1 - (1/4)^n ≥ 0.95Which implies that (1/4)^n ≤ 0.05We need to solve for n.Taking natural logarithm on both sides:ln((1/4)^n) ≤ ln(0.05)Which simplifies to:n * ln(1/4) ≤ ln(0.05)Since ln(1/4) is negative, when we divide both sides by it, the inequality sign will reverse.So,n ≥ ln(0.05) / ln(1/4)Compute the values:ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957ln(1/4) = ln(0.25) ≈ -1.3863So,n ≥ (-2.9957) / (-1.3863) ≈ 2.16Since n must be an integer, and we need the probability to be at least 95%, we round up to the next integer.So, n = 3.Wait, let me verify:For n=3:(1/4)^3 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625So, 1 - 0.015625 = 0.984375, which is approximately 98.44%, which is more than 95%.For n=2:(1/4)^2 = 1/16 = 0.06251 - 0.0625 = 0.9375, which is 93.75%, less than 95%.So, n=3 is the minimum number needed.Wait, but the question says \\"the minimum number of people like C\\". So, each person is like C, meaning each has a success probability of 3/4.So, yes, with 3 people, the probability is about 98.44%, which is above 95%, so n=3 is the minimum.Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step without logarithms:We have 1 - (1/4)^n ≥ 0.95So, (1/4)^n ≤ 0.05Compute (1/4)^n for n=1: 0.25, which is greater than 0.05n=2: 0.0625, still greater than 0.05n=3: 0.015625, which is less than 0.05So, n=3 is the minimum number.Therefore, the answer is 3.But wait, let me think again. The problem says \\"the minimum number of people like C required to ensure the probability of successfully cracking the code is at least 95%.\\"So, each person has a 3/4 chance, and we need the probability that at least one succeeds to be ≥ 0.95.Yes, as above, n=3 gives 1 - (1/4)^3 = 1 - 1/64 = 63/64 ≈ 0.984375, which is 98.4375%, which is above 95%.n=2 gives 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 = 0.9375, which is 93.75%, below 95%.Therefore, n=3 is the minimum number required.So, summarizing:1) 11/402) 19/203) 3I think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.For part (1), adding 1/20 + 3/40 + 3/20: converting to 40 denominator, 2/40 + 3/40 + 6/40 = 11/40. Correct.For part (2), 1 - (1/2)*(2/5)*(1/4) = 1 - (1/20) = 19/20. Correct.For part (3), solving 1 - (1/4)^n ≥ 0.95 leads to n=3. Correct.Yes, I think that's all correct.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{dfrac{11}{40}}  (2) boxed{dfrac{19}{20}}  (3) boxed{3}"},{"question":"Using the letters A, M, O, S, and U, we can form five-letter \\"words\\".

The options given are from 112 to 116, so it's a matter of calculating its exact position. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, I need to understand the problem clearly. We have five distinct letters: A, M, O, S, U. Each of these can be used to form five-letter words, and when we arrange all these words alphabetically, we need to find the position of the specific word USAMO. So, essentially, it's like finding the rank of USAMO in the dictionary order of all possible permutations of these five letters.Since all the letters are distinct, the total number of possible five-letter words is 5 factorial, which is 5! = 120. So, there are 120 different words. Now, we need to figure out where USAMO falls in this list.To approach this, I think we can calculate how many words come before USAMO by looking at each letter position one by one and determining how many words start with letters that come before the corresponding letter in USAMO. Then, we can sum those counts and add 1 to get the position of USAMO itself.Let me write down the word USAMO and note the order of the letters:U, S, A, M, O.Wait, hold on, actually, when we arrange the letters alphabetically, the order of the letters is important. Let me first figure out the alphabetical order of the given letters: A, M, O, S, U. So, A comes first, followed by M, then O, then S, and finally U.So, the alphabetical order is: A, M, O, S, U.That means when arranging the five-letter words, all words starting with A will come first, followed by those starting with M, then O, then S, and finally U.Our target word is USAMO. So, the first letter is U, which is the last in the alphabetical order. That means all words starting with A, M, O, and S will come before any word starting with U. So, how many words start with A, M, O, and S?Each starting letter has 4! = 24 permutations for the remaining four letters. So, starting with A: 24 words, starting with M: another 24, starting with O: another 24, and starting with S: another 24. So, total words before any word starting with U is 24 * 4 = 96.So, that means the first 96 words are those starting with A, M, O, S. Then, starting from word 97, we have words starting with U.Now, our word USAMO is one of these words starting with U. So, we need to figure out where it falls within the U-starting words.Let's look at the second letter of USAMO, which is S. So, after U, the next letters are S, A, M, O. Wait, but in the alphabetical order, after U, the next letters are A, M, O, S. So, the order of the remaining letters after U is A, M, O, S.So, the second letter in USAMO is S. Now, how many words start with U followed by a letter that comes before S in the alphabetical order? The letters available after U are A, M, O, S. So, the letters before S are A, M, O.Each of these letters as the second letter will fix the first two letters, and the remaining three letters can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So, for each of A, M, O as the second letter, we have 6 words. Therefore, the number of words starting with U followed by A, M, or O is 3 * 6 = 18.So, that means the first 18 words starting with U will have second letters A, M, O. Then, starting from word 97 + 18 + 1 = 116, we have words starting with U followed by S.Wait, hold on, let me clarify. The first 96 words are before U. Then, starting from 97, we have U followed by A, M, O, S. So, the first word starting with U is UA..., then UM..., then UO..., then US....Each of these blocks has 24 words? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, we're dealing with five-letter words, so after fixing the first two letters, the remaining three can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So, for each second letter, we have 6 words.So, starting with U, the second letters can be A, M, O, S. Each of these will have 6 words. So, the first 6 words starting with U are UA followed by permutations of the remaining three letters: M, O, S. Then, the next 6 are UM followed by permutations of A, O, S. Then, the next 6 are UO followed by permutations of A, M, S. Then, the last 6 are US followed by permutations of A, M, O.So, in total, starting from word 97, we have:97-102: UA followed by permutations.103-108: UM followed by permutations.109-114: UO followed by permutations.115-120: US followed by permutations.So, our word USAMO is in the last block, starting at 115. So, it's within the US... block. Now, let's look at the third letter.Our word is USAMO. So, after U and S, the third letter is A. So, let's see how many words come before USA... in the US... block.The remaining letters after U and S are A, M, O. So, the third letter can be A, M, or O. In alphabetical order, A comes first, then M, then O.So, the third letter in our word is A, which is the first in the alphabetical order. So, that means all words starting with USA... will come first in the US... block.Wait, but actually, within the US... block, the third letter can be A, M, or O. So, the number of words starting with USA is 2! = 2, since after USA, we have two letters left: M and O. So, USA followed by M and O can be arranged in 2 ways: USAMO and USAOM.Wait, but hold on, let's think again. The letters remaining after U, S, and A are M and O. So, the last two letters can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. So, USA followed by M and O can be USA M O or USA O M. So, that's two words.But in our case, the word is USAMO, which is USA M O. So, it's the first word in the USA... block.Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me think.Wait, no, actually, after fixing the first three letters as U, S, A, the remaining letters are M and O. So, the fourth and fifth letters can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways. So, the possible words are USAMO and USAOM.So, USAMO is the first one because M comes before O in the alphabetical order? Wait, no, in the remaining letters, after USA, we have M and O. So, the fourth letter can be M or O.Wait, in the alphabetical order, M comes before O, so the first word would be USAM followed by O, which is USAMO, and the second word would be USAO followed by M, which is USAOM.So, yes, USAMO is the first word in the USA... block.But wait, hold on, let's think about the third letter. After U and S, the third letter is A. So, in the US... block, the third letters can be A, M, or O.So, the number of words starting with USA is 2, as we saw. But before USA, are there any words starting with USM or USO?Wait, no, because the third letter is A, which is the first in the alphabetical order. So, all words starting with USA will come first, followed by USM..., then USO....Wait, but hold on, the third letter is A, which is the first, so there are no words starting with US followed by a letter before A. So, all words starting with USA will be the first set in the US... block.So, that means within the US... block, the first 2 words are USA followed by permutations of M and O. So, USAMO is the first word in the USA... block, which is the first word in the US... block.Wait, but hold on, the US... block has 6 words in total, right? Because after fixing U and S, we have 3 letters left: A, M, O. So, 3! = 6 permutations.So, the order within the US... block is determined by the third letter. The third letter can be A, M, or O. Each of these will fix the third letter, and the remaining two letters can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.So, the order is:1. USA followed by permutations of M and O: USAMO and USAOM.2. USM followed by permutations of A and O: USMAO and USMOA.3. USO followed by permutations of A and M: USAOM and USOMA.Wait, hold on, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, the third letter is fixed, and then the remaining two letters are arranged. So, for USA, we have two permutations: USAMO and USAOM.For USM, we have two permutations: USMAO and USMOA.For USO, we have two permutations: USAOM and USOMA.Wait, but hold on, USAOM is already counted in the USA block, right? Because USAOM is USA followed by O and M, which is USAOM.Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, when the third letter is A, the remaining letters are M and O, so the permutations are M and O. So, USA followed by M and O is USAMO and USAOM.Similarly, when the third letter is M, the remaining letters are A and O, so USM followed by A and O is USMAO and USMOA.Similarly, when the third letter is O, the remaining letters are A and M, so USO followed by A and M is USAOM and USOMA.Wait, but hold on, USAOM is both in the USA block and the USO block? That can't be. Wait, no, actually, no. Each word is unique, so when you fix the third letter, the remaining letters are unique.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the permutations of the letters A, M, O after fixing U and S.So, after U and S, the remaining letters are A, M, O. So, the permutations of these three letters are:1. A, M, O2. A, O, M3. M, A, O4. M, O, A5. O, A, M6. O, M, ASo, each of these corresponds to a word:1. USA M O -> USAMO2. USA O M -> USAOM3. USM A O -> USMAO4. USM O A -> USMOA5. USO A M -> USAOM6. USO M A -> USOMAWait, hold on, that can't be right because USAOM appears twice here. That must be a mistake.Wait, no, actually, when the third letter is A, the remaining letters are M and O, so the permutations are M, O and O, M, which gives USAMO and USAOM.When the third letter is M, the remaining letters are A and O, so the permutations are A, O and O, A, which gives USMAO and USMOA.When the third letter is O, the remaining letters are A and M, so the permutations are A, M and M, A, which gives USAOM and USOMA.Wait, so USAOM is listed twice because it's the same word? No, USAOM is USA followed by O and M, which is USAOM, and USO followed by A and M is USAOM. So, actually, it's the same word. So, that suggests that my initial approach is flawed because we can't have duplicate words.Wait, no, actually, no. Each permutation is unique because the starting letters are fixed. Wait, no, in reality, the word USAOM is formed by fixing U, S, A, O, M, but in different orders. Wait, no, each permutation is unique because the letters are arranged differently.Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me list all the permutations of A, M, O:1. A, M, O2. A, O, M3. M, A, O4. M, O, A5. O, A, M6. O, M, ASo, these are the six permutations. Now, when we fix U and S at the beginning, each of these permutations corresponds to a unique word:1. USA M O -> USAMO2. USA O M -> USAOM3. USM A O -> USMAO4. USM O A -> USMOA5. USO A M -> USAOM6. USO M A -> USOMAWait, so USAOM is appearing twice here, which is not possible because all permutations should be unique. So, that suggests that my approach is incorrect.Wait, hold on, no. Each permutation is unique because the order of the letters after U and S is different. So, for example, USAOM is formed by U, S, A, O, M, whereas USOAM is formed by U, S, O, A, M. So, they are different words.Wait, but in the list above, when I fix U, S, and then the permutation of A, M, O, each of the six permutations is unique. So, in that case, the six words are:1. USAMO2. USAOM3. USMAO4. USMOA5. USOAM6. USOMASo, that makes sense. So, in the US... block, the order is determined by the alphabetical order of the permutations of A, M, O.So, to figure out the order, we need to arrange the permutations of A, M, O in alphabetical order.So, let's list all permutations of A, M, O and sort them alphabetically.The permutations are:1. A, M, O2. A, O, M3. M, A, O4. M, O, A5. O, A, M6. O, M, ANow, let's sort these alphabetically:First, compare the first letter:- A comes before M and O.So, all permutations starting with A come first.Within the A-starting permutations, compare the second letter:- A, M, O vs. A, O, M.M comes before O, so A, M, O comes first, then A, O, M.Next, permutations starting with M:- M, A, O vs. M, O, A.A comes before O, so M, A, O comes first, then M, O, A.Then, permutations starting with O:- O, A, M vs. O, M, A.A comes before M, so O, A, M comes first, then O, M, A.So, the sorted order is:1. A, M, O2. A, O, M3. M, A, O4. M, O, A5. O, A, M6. O, M, ATherefore, the corresponding words in the US... block are:1. USAMO2. USAOM3. USMAO4. USMOA5. USOAM6. USOMASo, the first word in the US... block is USAMO, which is our target word. Therefore, USAMO is the first word in the US... block.Wait, so that means USAMO is the 97th word? Because the first 96 words are before U, and then the first word starting with U is USAMO.But hold on, no, because the US... block starts at word 97, but within the US... block, the first word is USAMO, which would be word 97.But the options given are 112, 113, 114, 115, 116. So, 97 is not among them. Hmm, that suggests that my reasoning is flawed somewhere.Wait, let me go back. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating how many words come before U.So, the letters in alphabetical order are A, M, O, S, U.So, starting letters before U are A, M, O, S.Each starting letter has 4! = 24 permutations.So, total words before U: 4 * 24 = 96.So, words starting with U are from 97 to 120.Now, within the U starting words, the second letter can be A, M, O, S.Each second letter will fix the first two letters, and the remaining three letters can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.So, the second letters in order are A, M, O, S.So, the first 6 words starting with U are UA..., then next 6 are UM..., then UO..., then US....So, words 97-102: UA...103-108: UM...109-114: UO...115-120: US...So, our word USAMO is in the US... block, which starts at 115.So, within the US... block, we have 6 words, as we listed earlier.And as we saw, the first word in the US... block is USAMO, which would be word 115.But hold on, the options are 112, 113, 114, 115, 116. So, 115 is an option, D.But wait, in my earlier reasoning, I thought that the US... block starts at 115, and USAMO is the first word there, so it's 115.But let me double-check because the options include 112, which is earlier.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the starting position of the US... block.Wait, let's recalculate:Total words before U: 4 * 24 = 96.So, words starting with U are from 97 to 120.Within the U starting words, the second letter can be A, M, O, S.Each second letter has 6 words.So, the first 6 words (97-102): UA...Next 6 (103-108): UM...Next 6 (109-114): UO...Next 6 (115-120): US...So, US... starts at 115.Therefore, USAMO is the first word in the US... block, so it's 115.But wait, the options have 115 as D, so that would be the answer.But hold on, in the initial problem, the word is USAMO, which is U, S, A, M, O.Wait, but in the US... block, the third letter is A, which is the first in the alphabetical order.So, the first word in the US... block is USAMO, which is 115.But let me think again, because sometimes when counting positions, we have to consider whether we're starting from 0 or 1.Wait, in this case, the first word is position 1, not 0. So, if we have 96 words before U, then the first word starting with U is 97.So, the US... block starts at 115, as we calculated.But let me think about the entire process again.Total permutations: 120.Number of words before U: 4 * 24 = 96.So, words starting with U: 24 words, from 97 to 120.Within the U starting words, the second letter can be A, M, O, S.Each second letter has 6 words.So, the first 6: UA... (97-102)Next 6: UM... (103-108)Next 6: UO... (109-114)Next 6: US... (115-120)So, US... starts at 115.Within the US... block, the third letter can be A, M, O.Each third letter has 2 words, since after fixing three letters, we have 2 letters left, which can be arranged in 2 ways.So, the order of the third letters is A, M, O.So, the first two words in the US... block are USA... (115-116)Then, USM... (117-118)Then, USO... (119-120)Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier thought.Wait, no, actually, after fixing U and S, the third letter can be A, M, or O.Each third letter will fix the third position, and the remaining two letters can be arranged in 2 ways.So, for each third letter, we have 2 words.So, the order is:1. USA... (two words: USAMO and USAOM) at positions 115 and 116.2. USM... (two words: USMAO and USMOA) at positions 117 and 118.3. USO... (two words: USAOM and USOMA) at positions 119 and 120.Wait, but hold on, USAOM is appearing again here, which is conflicting.Wait, no, actually, when the third letter is A, the remaining letters are M and O, so the permutations are M and O, giving USAMO and USAOM.When the third letter is M, the remaining letters are A and O, giving USMAO and USMOA.When the third letter is O, the remaining letters are A and M, giving USAOM and USOMA.Wait, so USAOM is formed both when the third letter is A and when the third letter is O. But that can't be, because USAOM is a unique word.Wait, no, actually, no. When the third letter is A, the word is USA followed by M and O, which is USAMO and USAOM.When the third letter is O, the word is USO followed by A and M, which is USAOM and USOMA.Wait, so USAOM is the same word whether you fix the third letter as A or O? That can't be.Wait, no, actually, no. Because when the third letter is A, the word is USA followed by O and M, which is USAOM.When the third letter is O, the word is USO followed by A and M, which is USAOM.Wait, so USAOM is the same word regardless of how you fix the third letter? That can't be, because USAOM is USA followed by O and M, whereas USOAM is USO followed by A and M. Wait, no, USAOM is USA followed by O and M, which is USAOM, whereas USOAM is USO followed by A and M, which is USOAM.Wait, so they are different words. So, USAOM is USA followed by O and M, whereas USOAM is USO followed by A and M.Therefore, they are different words, so both are valid and distinct.Therefore, in the US... block, the order is:1. USAMO (115)2. USAOM (116)3. USMAO (117)4. USMOA (118)5. USAOM (119)6. USOMA (120)Wait, but hold on, that can't be right because USAOM is appearing twice, which is not possible.Wait, no, actually, no. When the third letter is A, the words are USAMO and USAOM.When the third letter is M, the words are USMAO and USMOA.When the third letter is O, the words are USAOM and USOMA.Wait, so USAOM is formed when the third letter is A and when the third letter is O. That suggests that USAOM is the same word, which is not possible because the letters are arranged differently.Wait, no, actually, USAOM is USA followed by O and M, which is USAOM, whereas USAOM when the third letter is O is USO followed by A and M, which is USAOM. Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, no, when the third letter is O, the word is USO followed by A and M, which is USAOM. Wait, no, USO followed by A and M is USAOM? No, USO followed by A and M would be USAOM? Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, let me think. If the first two letters are U and S, and the third letter is O, then the remaining letters are A and M. So, the fourth and fifth letters can be A and M, which can be arranged as A followed by M or M followed by A.So, the words would be USOAM and USOMA.Wait, so when the third letter is O, the words are USOAM and USOMA.Similarly, when the third letter is A, the words are USAMO and USAOM.So, USAOM is a different word from USOAM.Therefore, in the US... block, the six words are:1. USAMO (115)2. USAOM (116)3. USMAO (117)4. USMOA (118)5. USOAM (119)6. USOMA (120)So, USAMO is the first word in the US... block, which is position 115.Therefore, the answer should be 115, which is option D.But wait, hold on, the options are:(A) 112(B) 113(C) 114(D) 115(E) 116So, 115 is an option, so that should be the answer.But wait, in my initial reasoning, I thought that the US... block starts at 115, and USAMO is the first word there, so it's 115.But let me cross-verify.Total words before U: 4 * 24 = 96.Words starting with U: 24 words, from 97 to 120.Within the U starting words, the second letter can be A, M, O, S.Each second letter has 6 words.So, the first 6: UA... (97-102)Next 6: UM... (103-108)Next 6: UO... (109-114)Next 6: US... (115-120)So, US... starts at 115.Within the US... block, the third letter can be A, M, O.Each third letter has 2 words.So, the first two words are USA... (115-116)Then, USM... (117-118)Then, USO... (119-120)So, USAMO is the first word in the US... block, which is 115.Therefore, the position is 115, which is option D.But wait, in the initial problem statement, the word is USAMO, which is U, S, A, M, O.Wait, but in the US... block, when the third letter is A, the remaining letters are M and O, so the permutations are M and O.So, the first word is USAMO, and the second is USAOM.So, USAMO is 115, USAOM is 116.Therefore, the answer is 115, which is D.But wait, let me think again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error.So, total words before U: 96.Then, starting from 97, we have the first word starting with U.Each second letter has 6 words.So, UA...: 97-102UM...: 103-108UO...: 109-114US...: 115-120So, US... starts at 115.Within US..., the third letter can be A, M, O.Each third letter has 2 words.So, USA...: 115-116USM...: 117-118USO...: 119-120Therefore, USAMO is the first word in the USA... block, which is 115.So, yeah, 115 is the position.But wait, let me think about the entire permutation list.Alternatively, maybe I can list all the permutations in order and see where USAMO falls.But that would be time-consuming, but perhaps for verification.Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the position by considering each letter's contribution.So, the formula for finding the rank of a word in alphabetical order is:For each letter in the word, from left to right, count how many letters come before it in the remaining letters, multiply by the number of permutations possible with the remaining letters, and sum all these up. Then, add 1 to get the rank.So, let's apply this formula.Given the word USAMO.Letters in alphabetical order: A, M, O, S, U.So, the first letter is U.Number of letters before U: A, M, O, S. So, 4 letters.Each of these letters as the first letter would fix the first letter, and the remaining four letters can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.So, total words before any word starting with U: 4 * 24 = 96.Now, moving to the second letter.After fixing U as the first letter, the remaining letters are A, M, O, S.Our word is USAMO, so the second letter is S.In the remaining letters A, M, O, S, the letters before S are A, M, O.So, number of letters before S: 3.Each of these letters as the second letter would fix the first two letters, and the remaining three letters can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.So, total words before any word starting with U followed by S: 3 * 6 = 18.So, total so far: 96 + 18 = 114.Now, moving to the third letter.After fixing U and S, the remaining letters are A, M, O.Our word is USAMO, so the third letter is A.In the remaining letters A, M, O, the letters before A: none.So, number of letters before A: 0.Each of these letters as the third letter would fix the first three letters, and the remaining two letters can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.So, total words before any word starting with USA: 0 * 2 = 0.Total so far: 114 + 0 = 114.Moving to the fourth letter.After fixing U, S, A, the remaining letters are M, O.Our word is USAMO, so the fourth letter is M.In the remaining letters M, O, the letters before M: none.So, number of letters before M: 0.Each of these letters as the fourth letter would fix the first four letters, and the remaining one letter can be arranged in 1! = 1 way.So, total words before any word starting with USAM: 0 * 1 = 0.Total so far: 114 + 0 = 114.Finally, the fifth letter is O, which is the only remaining letter, so no letters before it.So, total words before USAMO: 114.Therefore, the rank of USAMO is 114 + 1 = 115.So, that confirms it. The position is 115, which is option D.Therefore, the answer is D) 115.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"If point A (m, 5) and point B (-6, -n) are symmetric about the x-axis, then (m+n)^{2012}= .","answer":"To determine the value of ((m + n)^{2012}), we start by understanding the condition that points (A (m, 5)) and (B (-6, -n)) are symmetric about the x-axis.When two points are symmetric about the x-axis, their x-coordinates are equal, and their y-coordinates are negatives of each other.1. **Equate the x-coordinates:**   [   m = -6   ]2. **Equate the y-coordinates as negatives:**   [   5 = -(-n) implies 5 = n   ]3. **Calculate (m + n):**   [   m + n = -6 + 5 = -1   ]4. **Raise (-1) to the power of 2012:**   [   (-1)^{2012} = 1   ]Therefore, the value of ((m + n)^{2012}) is 1."},{"question":"Given that the perimeter of a sector is 8 cm, and its area is 4 cm<sup>2</sup>, the absolute value of the central angle of the sector in radians is __________.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a sector of a circle. The perimeter is 8 cm, and the area is 4 cm². I need to find the absolute value of the central angle in radians. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that a sector is like a \\"slice\\" of a circle, bounded by two radii and an arc. The perimeter of the sector isn't just the circumference of the circle; it's the sum of the two radii and the length of the arc. So, the formula for the perimeter (or circumference) of a sector should be: perimeter = 2r + arc length.And the area of a sector is given by another formula. I think it's (1/2) * r² * θ, where θ is the central angle in radians. Let me write that down:Area = (1/2) * r² * θAnd the perimeter is 2r + arc length. The arc length for a sector is rθ, right? Because the full circumference is 2πr, so the arc length is a fraction of that, which is θ/(2π) * 2πr = rθ. So, the perimeter formula is:Perimeter = 2r + rθGiven that the perimeter is 8 cm, so:2r + rθ = 8And the area is 4 cm², so:(1/2) * r² * θ = 4So, I have two equations:1) 2r + rθ = 82) (1/2) * r² * θ = 4I need to solve for θ. Let me see how to do this. Maybe I can express θ from one equation and substitute into the other.From equation 1:2r + rθ = 8Let me factor out r:r(2 + θ) = 8So, r = 8 / (2 + θ)Okay, so now I can plug this expression for r into equation 2.Equation 2 is:(1/2) * r² * θ = 4Substituting r = 8 / (2 + θ):(1/2) * (8 / (2 + θ))² * θ = 4Let me compute this step by step.First, square (8 / (2 + θ)):(8 / (2 + θ))² = 64 / (2 + θ)²Then, multiply by θ:64θ / (2 + θ)²Then, multiply by 1/2:(64θ / (2 + θ)²) * (1/2) = 32θ / (2 + θ)²So, equation 2 becomes:32θ / (2 + θ)² = 4Now, let's solve for θ.Multiply both sides by (2 + θ)²:32θ = 4 * (2 + θ)²Divide both sides by 4:8θ = (2 + θ)²Expand the right side:(2 + θ)² = 4 + 4θ + θ²So, the equation is:8θ = 4 + 4θ + θ²Bring all terms to one side:θ² + 4θ + 4 - 8θ = 0Simplify:θ² - 4θ + 4 = 0Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:θ² - 4θ + 4 = 0I can try to factor this. Let's see:Looking for two numbers that multiply to 4 and add up to -4. Hmm, -2 and -2.So, (θ - 2)(θ - 2) = 0, which is (θ - 2)² = 0So, θ = 2Wait, so θ is 2 radians? Let me check if that makes sense.Let me plug θ = 2 back into the expressions for r and see if the perimeter and area hold.From equation 1:r = 8 / (2 + θ) = 8 / (2 + 2) = 8 / 4 = 2 cmSo, radius is 2 cm.Now, check the area:Area = (1/2) * r² * θ = (1/2) * (2)² * 2 = (1/2) * 4 * 2 = (1/2) * 8 = 4 cm²That's correct.Check the perimeter:Perimeter = 2r + rθ = 2*2 + 2*2 = 4 + 4 = 8 cmPerfect, that's also correct.So, θ is 2 radians. Since the question asks for the absolute value, which is just 2.Wait, but hold on. Quadratic equations can sometimes have two solutions, but in this case, it was a perfect square, so only one solution. So, θ is 2 radians.Is there any chance of another solution? Let me think.In the quadratic equation, θ² - 4θ + 4 = 0, discriminant is 16 - 16 = 0, so only one solution, θ = 2. So, no, only one solution.Therefore, the central angle is 2 radians.**Final Answer**The absolute value of the central angle is boxed{2}."},{"question":"For any real numbers x and y, find the minimum value of |x-1|+|x|+|y-1|+|y+1|.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimum value of the expression |x - 1| + |x| + |y - 1| + |y + 1| for any real numbers x and y. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I notice that the expression is the sum of absolute values, and it's split into two parts: one involving x and the other involving y. That makes me think maybe I can tackle each part separately and then combine the results. So, let me rewrite the expression:|x - 1| + |x| + |y - 1| + |y + 1| = (|x - 1| + |x|) + (|y - 1| + |y + 1|)Alright, so I have two separate sums: one for x and one for y. Maybe I can find the minimum of each part individually and then add them together. That seems like a good plan.Let me start with the x part: |x - 1| + |x|. I remember that the sum of absolute values can often be minimized by considering the median or something like that, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should graph it or think about the critical points where the expression changes its behavior.The expression |x - 1| + |x| is the sum of two absolute values. The points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign are at x = 0 and x = 1. So, I can break down the problem into intervals based on these critical points.Case 1: x < 0In this case, both |x - 1| and |x| will be negative inside, so:|x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x + 1|x| = -xSo, the sum becomes (-x + 1) + (-x) = -2x + 1Since x < 0, -2x is positive, so as x decreases, the sum increases. Therefore, the minimum in this interval occurs at x = 0.Case 2: 0 ≤ x ≤ 1Here, |x| = x, and |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x + 1So, the sum is x + (-x + 1) = 1Interesting, so in this interval, the sum is constant at 1, regardless of x.Case 3: x > 1In this case, both |x - 1| and |x| are positive inside, so:|x - 1| = x - 1|x| = xSum is (x - 1) + x = 2x - 1Since x > 1, as x increases, the sum increases. So, the minimum in this interval occurs at x = 1.Putting it all together, the minimum of |x - 1| + |x| is 1, achieved when x is between 0 and 1, inclusive.Okay, so that takes care of the x part. Now, let's move on to the y part: |y - 1| + |y + 1|.Similarly, I can analyze this expression by considering the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign. These points are at y = -1 and y = 1.So, let's break it down into intervals:Case 1: y < -1Here, both |y - 1| and |y + 1| will be negative inside:|y - 1| = -(y - 1) = -y + 1|y + 1| = -(y + 1) = -y - 1Sum is (-y + 1) + (-y - 1) = -2ySince y < -1, -2y is positive and increases as y decreases. So, the minimum in this interval occurs at y = -1.Case 2: -1 ≤ y ≤ 1In this interval, |y + 1| = y + 1, and |y - 1| = -(y - 1) = -y + 1So, the sum is (y + 1) + (-y + 1) = 2That's a constant value of 2, regardless of y in this interval.Case 3: y > 1Here, both |y - 1| and |y + 1| are positive inside:|y - 1| = y - 1|y + 1| = y + 1Sum is (y - 1) + (y + 1) = 2ySince y > 1, as y increases, the sum increases. So, the minimum in this interval occurs at y = 1.Putting it all together, the minimum of |y - 1| + |y + 1| is 2, achieved when y is between -1 and 1, inclusive.Alright, so now I have the minimum for the x part as 1 and the minimum for the y part as 2. Therefore, the total minimum of the original expression should be 1 + 2 = 3.Wait, let me double-check that. Is there a possibility that the x and y parts could interfere with each other? Hmm, no, because the expression is separable into x and y components. So, the minimum of the sum is indeed the sum of the minima.But just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any dependency between x and y. Looking at the original expression, it's |x - 1| + |x| + |y - 1| + |y + 1|. There's no cross term involving both x and y, so they are independent. Therefore, minimizing each part separately is valid.So, for x, the minimum is 1, achieved when x is between 0 and 1. For y, the minimum is 2, achieved when y is between -1 and 1. Therefore, the overall minimum is 1 + 2 = 3.Let me verify this by plugging in specific values. Let's choose x = 0 and y = 0.Compute |0 - 1| + |0| + |0 - 1| + |0 + 1| = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3. Yep, that works.What if I choose x = 0.5 and y = 0? Then, |0.5 - 1| + |0.5| + |0 - 1| + |0 + 1| = 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 = 3. Still 3.How about x = 1 and y = -1? |1 - 1| + |1| + |-1 - 1| + |-1 + 1| = 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 3. Still 3.And if I choose x = 0.5 and y = 0.5, then |0.5 - 1| + |0.5| + |0.5 - 1| + |0.5 + 1| = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 3. Still 3.So, regardless of where I choose x and y within their respective intervals, the total is 3. If I choose x outside [0,1] or y outside [-1,1], the total increases.For example, x = 2 and y = 2: |2 - 1| + |2| + |2 - 1| + |2 + 1| = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7.Or x = -1 and y = -2: |-1 - 1| + |-1| + |-2 - 1| + |-2 + 1| = 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7.So, it does seem like 3 is indeed the minimum value.Therefore, after analyzing both parts separately and verifying with specific examples, I conclude that the minimum value of the expression is 3.**Final Answer**The minimum value is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Find all solutions to[x^2 + 4x + 4x sqrt{x + 3} = 13.]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: (x^2 + 4x + 4x sqrt{x + 3} = 13). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I notice that there's a square root term, (sqrt{x + 3}), which might make things tricky. Maybe I can simplify the equation by making a substitution. Let me think... If I let (y = sqrt{x + 3}), then (y^2 = x + 3), so (x = y^2 - 3). That might help me rewrite the equation in terms of (y), which could be easier to handle.Let me substitute (x = y^2 - 3) into the original equation. So, replacing every (x) with (y^2 - 3):[(y^2 - 3)^2 + 4(y^2 - 3) + 4(y^2 - 3)y = 13]Okay, now I need to expand and simplify this equation. Let's take it term by term.First term: ((y^2 - 3)^2). Expanding that, I get (y^4 - 6y^2 + 9).Second term: (4(y^2 - 3)). That's (4y^2 - 12).Third term: (4(y^2 - 3)y). Let's distribute the (y): (4y^3 - 12y).Putting it all together:[(y^4 - 6y^2 + 9) + (4y^2 - 12) + (4y^3 - 12y) = 13]Now, combine like terms:- (y^4) term: (y^4)- (y^3) term: (4y^3)- (y^2) terms: (-6y^2 + 4y^2 = -2y^2)- (y) term: (-12y)- Constants: (9 - 12 = -3)So, the equation becomes:[y^4 + 4y^3 - 2y^2 - 12y - 3 = 13]Subtract 13 from both sides to set the equation to zero:[y^4 + 4y^3 - 2y^2 - 12y - 16 = 0]Hmm, now I have a quartic equation in terms of (y). Quartic equations can be tough, but maybe this one factors nicely. Let me try to factor it.I'll look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term is -16, and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16.Let me test (y = 2):[2^4 + 4(2)^3 - 2(2)^2 - 12(2) - 16 = 16 + 32 - 8 - 24 - 16 = (16 + 32) - (8 + 24 + 16) = 48 - 48 = 0]Hey, (y = 2) is a root! So, (y - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.Using synthetic division with (y = 2):Coefficients: 1 (y^4), 4 (y^3), -2 (y^2), -12 (y), -16 (constant)Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by 2: 2. Add to next coefficient: 4 + 2 = 6.Multiply 6 by 2: 12. Add to next coefficient: -2 + 12 = 10.Multiply 10 by 2: 20. Add to next coefficient: -12 + 20 = 8.Multiply 8 by 2: 16. Add to last coefficient: -16 + 16 = 0. Perfect.So, the polynomial factors as ((y - 2)(y^3 + 6y^2 + 10y + 8)).Now, let's factor the cubic polynomial (y^3 + 6y^2 + 10y + 8). Again, using the Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8.Testing (y = -2):[(-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 10(-2) + 8 = -8 + 24 - 20 + 8 = (-8 + 24) + (-20 + 8) = 16 - 12 = 4 ≠ 0]Not a root. Testing (y = -1):[(-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 10(-1) + 8 = -1 + 6 - 10 + 8 = (-1 + 6) + (-10 + 8) = 5 - 2 = 3 ≠ 0]Not a root. Testing (y = -4):[(-4)^3 + 6(-4)^2 + 10(-4) + 8 = -64 + 96 - 40 + 8 = (-64 + 96) + (-40 + 8) = 32 - 32 = 0]Great, (y = -4) is a root. So, (y + 4) is a factor. Let's perform synthetic division again on the cubic with (y = -4):Coefficients: 1 (y^3), 6 (y^2), 10 (y), 8 (constant)Bring down the 1.Multiply 1 by -4: -4. Add to next coefficient: 6 + (-4) = 2.Multiply 2 by -4: -8. Add to next coefficient: 10 + (-8) = 2.Multiply 2 by -4: -8. Add to last coefficient: 8 + (-8) = 0.So, the cubic factors as ((y + 4)(y^2 + 2y + 2)).Putting it all together, the quartic factors as:[(y - 2)(y + 4)(y^2 + 2y + 2) = 0]So, the solutions for (y) are (y = 2), (y = -4), and the roots of (y^2 + 2y + 2 = 0).Let's solve (y^2 + 2y + 2 = 0) using the quadratic formula:[y = frac{-2 pm sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{-4}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 2i}{2} = -1 pm i]So, the solutions for (y) are (2), (-4), (-1 + i), and (-1 - i). But since (y = sqrt{x + 3}), (y) must be a real number because square roots are defined to be non-negative in real numbers. Therefore, the complex solutions for (y) don't correspond to real solutions for (x). So, we can ignore the complex roots.Now, let's consider the real solutions for (y): (y = 2) and (y = -4).But wait, (y = sqrt{x + 3}) must be non-negative, right? So, (y = -4) is not possible because square roots can't be negative. Therefore, only (y = 2) is a valid solution.So, (y = 2), which means (sqrt{x + 3} = 2). Squaring both sides, we get:[x + 3 = 4 implies x = 1]But hold on, let me check if this solution satisfies the original equation because sometimes when we square both sides or make substitutions, we can introduce extraneous solutions.Plugging (x = 1) into the original equation:Left side: (1^2 + 4(1) + 4(1)sqrt{1 + 3} = 1 + 4 + 4 times 2 = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13).Right side: 13.So, yes, it works. So, (x = 1) is a valid solution.But wait, earlier when I factored the quartic, I had (y = -4) as a root, but since (y) can't be negative, I dismissed it. But just to be thorough, let me see what (x) would be if (y = -4):(y = -4) implies (sqrt{x + 3} = -4), which is impossible because square roots are non-negative. So, no solution from (y = -4).But hold on, could there be another solution? Because quartic equations can have up to four real roots, but in this case, only one real root for (y) leads to a valid (x). Hmm.Wait, let me double-check my substitution. I set (y = sqrt{x + 3}), so (y) is non-negative, and (x = y^2 - 3). So, if (y) is 2, (x = 4 - 3 = 1). If (y) is -4, (x = 16 - 3 = 13), but since (y) can't be negative, (x = 13) would correspond to (y = sqrt{13 + 3} = sqrt{16} = 4), which is positive. Wait, hold on, this seems conflicting.Wait, no, if (y = -4), then (x = y^2 - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13), but (y = sqrt{x + 3}) must equal -4, which is impossible. So, (x = 13) would require (y = 4), not -4. So, actually, (x = 13) would correspond to (y = 4), which is a different solution.Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.When I had (y = -4), I said that (y = sqrt{x + 3}) can't be negative, so (y = -4) is invalid. But if I plug (x = 13) into the original equation, does it satisfy?Let me check (x = 13):Left side: (13^2 + 4(13) + 4(13)sqrt{13 + 3}).Calculating each term:(13^2 = 169)(4(13) = 52)(4(13) = 52), and (sqrt{16} = 4), so (52 times 4 = 208).Adding them up: 169 + 52 + 208 = 169 + 52 is 221, plus 208 is 429.Right side is 13, so 429 ≠ 13. Therefore, (x = 13) is not a solution. So, even though (y = -4) gives (x = 13), it doesn't satisfy the original equation. So, (x = 13) is extraneous.Therefore, only (x = 1) is a valid solution.But wait, let me think again. When I substituted (y = sqrt{x + 3}), I considered (y) as non-negative, but when I solved the quartic, I got (y = -4) as a root, which led to (x = 13). But since (y = -4) is invalid, (x = 13) is not a solution.But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other solutions. The quartic had four roots, but only (y = 2) was valid. So, only (x = 1) is a solution.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible solutions. Maybe I should consider another substitution or approach.Alternatively, let me try to rearrange the original equation:(x^2 + 4x + 4x sqrt{x + 3} = 13)Let me move all terms to one side:(x^2 + 4x + 4x sqrt{x + 3} - 13 = 0)Hmm, maybe I can factor this somehow. Alternatively, I can try to isolate the square root term.Let me try that:(x^2 + 4x - 13 = -4x sqrt{x + 3})Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:((x^2 + 4x - 13)^2 = (-4x sqrt{x + 3})^2)Simplify both sides:Left side: ((x^2 + 4x - 13)^2)Right side: (16x^2 (x + 3))Let me expand the left side:First, write it as ((x^2 + 4x - 13)(x^2 + 4x - 13)).Multiplying term by term:First, (x^2 times x^2 = x^4)(x^2 times 4x = 4x^3)(x^2 times (-13) = -13x^2)Then, (4x times x^2 = 4x^3)(4x times 4x = 16x^2)(4x times (-13) = -52x)Then, (-13 times x^2 = -13x^2)(-13 times 4x = -52x)(-13 times (-13) = 169)Now, combine like terms:- (x^4)- (4x^3 + 4x^3 = 8x^3)- (-13x^2 + 16x^2 -13x^2 = (-13 -13 +16)x^2 = (-26 +16)x^2 = -10x^2)- (-52x -52x = -104x)- Constant: 169So, left side becomes:(x^4 + 8x^3 -10x^2 -104x + 169)Right side is (16x^2(x + 3) = 16x^3 + 48x^2)Bring all terms to the left side:(x^4 + 8x^3 -10x^2 -104x + 169 -16x^3 -48x^2 = 0)Combine like terms:- (x^4)- (8x^3 -16x^3 = -8x^3)- (-10x^2 -48x^2 = -58x^2)- (-104x)- Constant: 169So, the equation becomes:(x^4 -8x^3 -58x^2 -104x +169 = 0)Hmm, now I have another quartic equation. This seems more complicated than before. Maybe I made a mistake earlier? Or perhaps this approach isn't better.Wait, let me check my earlier substitution method. I think that was more straightforward and led me to (x = 1) as the only solution. But just to make sure, let me see if this quartic can be factored.Alternatively, maybe I can use the substitution method again. Let me try to factor this quartic.Looking for rational roots with possible roots ±1, ±13, ±169, etc.Testing (x = 1):(1 -8 -58 -104 +169 = 1 -8 = -7; -7 -58 = -65; -65 -104 = -169; -169 +169 = 0). So, (x = 1) is a root.So, (x - 1) is a factor. Let's perform synthetic division:Coefficients: 1 (x^4), -8 (x^3), -58 (x^2), -104 (x), 169 (constant)Using (x = 1):Bring down 1.Multiply 1 by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient: -8 +1 = -7.Multiply -7 by 1: -7. Add to next coefficient: -58 + (-7) = -65.Multiply -65 by 1: -65. Add to next coefficient: -104 + (-65) = -169.Multiply -169 by 1: -169. Add to last coefficient: 169 + (-169) = 0.So, the quartic factors as ((x - 1)(x^3 -7x^2 -65x -169)).Now, let's factor the cubic (x^3 -7x^2 -65x -169). Again, using Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are ±1, ±13, ±169.Testing (x = 13):(13^3 -7(13)^2 -65(13) -169 = 2197 - 1183 - 845 -169).Calculating:2197 - 1183 = 10141014 - 845 = 169169 - 169 = 0So, (x = 13) is a root. Therefore, (x -13) is a factor.Performing synthetic division on the cubic with (x =13):Coefficients: 1 (x^3), -7 (x^2), -65 (x), -169 (constant)Bring down 1.Multiply 1 by13:13. Add to next coefficient: -7 +13=6.Multiply 6 by13:78. Add to next coefficient: -65 +78=13.Multiply13 by13=169. Add to last coefficient: -169 +169=0.So, the cubic factors as ((x -13)(x^2 +6x +13)).Therefore, the quartic factors as:[(x -1)(x -13)(x^2 +6x +13) = 0]So, the solutions are (x =1), (x =13), and the roots of (x^2 +6x +13 =0).Solving (x^2 +6x +13 =0) using quadratic formula:[x = frac{-6 pm sqrt{36 -52}}{2} = frac{-6 pm sqrt{-16}}{2} = frac{-6 pm4i}{2} = -3 pm2i]So, the solutions are (x =1), (x =13), (x = -3 +2i), (x = -3 -2i).But since we're dealing with real numbers (I assume the problem is in real numbers unless specified otherwise), the complex solutions are discarded. So, possible real solutions are (x =1) and (x =13).But earlier, when I substituted (x =13) into the original equation, it didn't satisfy. So, why is (x =13) appearing here?Wait, perhaps because when I squared both sides, I introduced an extraneous solution. So, even though algebraically (x =13) is a root of the quartic, it doesn't satisfy the original equation.Let me verify (x =13) again:Original equation: (x^2 +4x +4x sqrt{x +3} =13)Plugging in (x =13):Left side: (13^2 +4(13) +4(13)sqrt{13 +3})Calculate each term:13^2 = 1694*13 = 524*13 = 52, and sqrt(16)=4, so 52*4=208Adding them up: 169 +52 +208 = 429Right side:13429 ≠13, so (x=13) is indeed extraneous.Therefore, only (x=1) is the valid solution.Wait, but in the substitution method earlier, I only got (x=1), but in the squaring method, I got (x=1) and (x=13), but (x=13) is extraneous. So, the only solution is (x=1).But let me think again. Maybe I missed another solution? Because sometimes when you square both sides, you can lose solutions or gain extraneous ones.Wait, in the substitution method, I had (y =2) leading to (x=1), and (y=-4) leading to (x=13), but (y=-4) is invalid. So, only (x=1) is valid.But in the squaring method, I got (x=1) and (x=13), but (x=13) is extraneous. So, only (x=1) is valid.Therefore, the only solution is (x=1).But just to make sure, let me check if there are any other possible solutions. Maybe I should graph the original equation or consider the behavior of the function.Let me define (f(x) =x^2 +4x +4x sqrt{x +3}). I want to find where (f(x) =13).First, the domain of (f(x)) is (x +3 geq0 implies x geq -3).So, (x) must be greater than or equal to -3.Let me analyze (f(x)):As (x) increases from -3 to infinity, (f(x)) is a combination of a quadratic and a term with a square root, which grows slower than the quadratic.At (x = -3), (f(-3) = (-3)^2 +4*(-3) +4*(-3)*sqrt{0} =9 -12 +0 = -3).At (x=0), (f(0)=0 +0 +0=0).At (x=1), (f(1)=1 +4 +4*1*2=1+4+8=13). So, that's our solution.At (x=2), (f(2)=4 +8 +4*2*sqrt{5}=12 +8*2.236≈12 +17.888≈29.888).At (x=13), as we saw, it's 429, which is way higher.So, the function (f(x)) increases from -3 at (x=-3) to 0 at (x=0), then increases further. It crosses 13 at (x=1), and keeps increasing beyond that.Is there another point where (f(x)=13)? Let's see.Wait, between (x=-3) and (x=1), (f(x)) goes from -3 to 13. So, it's increasing in that interval? Or does it have any turning points?Let me compute the derivative to check if there are any local maxima or minima.(f(x) =x^2 +4x +4x sqrt{x +3})Compute (f'(x)):First term: derivative of (x^2) is (2x).Second term: derivative of (4x) is 4.Third term: derivative of (4x sqrt{x +3}). Let me use product rule:Let (u =4x), (v = sqrt{x +3}).Then, (u' =4), (v' = frac{1}{2sqrt{x +3}}).So, derivative is (u'v + uv' =4 sqrt{x +3} +4x * frac{1}{2sqrt{x +3}} =4 sqrt{x +3} + frac{2x}{sqrt{x +3}}).So, overall derivative:(f'(x) =2x +4 +4 sqrt{x +3} + frac{2x}{sqrt{x +3}}).This is always positive for (x > -3) because all terms are positive:- (2x) is positive when (x >0), but even when (x) is negative, as long as (x > -3), (2x) is greater than -6.- 4 is positive.- (4 sqrt{x +3}) is positive.- (frac{2x}{sqrt{x +3}}) is positive when (x >0), but when (x <0), it's negative. However, let's see if the entire derivative is positive.Wait, for (x) between -3 and 0:Let me pick (x = -2):(f'(-2) =2*(-2) +4 +4 sqrt{1} + frac{2*(-2)}{sqrt{1}} = -4 +4 +4*1 + (-4)/1 = -4 +4 +4 -4 =0).Hmm, so at (x = -2), the derivative is zero. So, there's a critical point at (x = -2).Let me check the behavior around (x = -2):For (x) slightly less than -2, say (x = -2.1):(f'(-2.1) =2*(-2.1) +4 +4 sqrt{-2.1 +3} + frac{2*(-2.1)}{sqrt{0.9}})Calculating:2*(-2.1) = -4.24 remains 44*sqrt(0.9) ≈4*0.9487≈3.79482*(-2.1)/sqrt(0.9)≈-4.2/0.9487≈-4.427Adding them up: -4.2 +4 +3.7948 -4.427 ≈ (-4.2 +4) + (3.7948 -4.427) ≈ (-0.2) + (-0.632) ≈ -0.832 <0So, the derivative is negative just below (x = -2).For (x) slightly more than -2, say (x = -1.9):(f'(-1.9) =2*(-1.9) +4 +4 sqrt{1.1} + frac{2*(-1.9)}{sqrt{1.1}})Calculating:2*(-1.9) = -3.84 remains 44*sqrt(1.1)≈4*1.0488≈4.1952*(-1.9)/sqrt(1.1)≈-3.8/1.0488≈-3.625Adding them up: -3.8 +4 +4.195 -3.625 ≈ (-3.8 +4) + (4.195 -3.625) ≈ 0.2 +0.57≈0.77 >0So, the derivative changes from negative to positive at (x = -2), indicating a local minimum at (x = -2).So, the function (f(x)) decreases from (x = -3) to (x = -2), reaching a minimum at (x = -2), then increases from (x = -2) onwards.So, at (x = -2), what is (f(x))?Compute (f(-2)):((-2)^2 +4*(-2) +4*(-2)sqrt{-2 +3})Calculates to:4 -8 + (-8)*1 =4 -8 -8= -12.So, the function has a minimum value of -12 at (x = -2).Therefore, the function (f(x)) goes from -3 at (x = -3), decreases to -12 at (x = -2), then increases to 0 at (x =0), and keeps increasing beyond.Since (f(1) =13), and the function is increasing for (x > -2), and since (f(x)) is continuous, there is only one solution at (x =1).Therefore, the only real solution is (x =1).I think that's thorough enough. I considered substitution, squaring both sides, factoring, checking for extraneous solutions, analyzing the function's behavior through derivatives, and confirming the solution through multiple methods. So, I'm confident that (x =1) is the only solution.**Final Answer**The solution is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Find the smallest number composed exclusively of ones that is divisible by 333...33 (where there are 100 threes in the number).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem: I need to find the smallest number made up entirely of ones (like 1, 11, 111, etc.) that's divisible by a number made up of 100 threes. That big number is 333...33 with 100 threes. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand the problem better. The number we're dealing with is a string of 100 threes. Let's denote this number as N. So, N = 333...33 (100 times). I need to find the smallest number composed only of ones, let's call it M, such that M is divisible by N. In other words, M mod N should be 0.Numbers made up entirely of ones are called repunits. A repunit with k digits is denoted as R_k. So, R_k = 111...11 (k times). My task is to find the smallest k such that R_k is divisible by N.Okay, so I need to find the minimal k where R_k ≡ 0 mod N. That is, R_k is a multiple of N. Since N is 333...33 with 100 threes, maybe I can express N in a different form to make it easier to work with.Let me think about how to express N. Since N is 333...33 (100 threes), that's the same as 3 multiplied by a number with 100 ones. Because 3 * 111...11 (100 ones) = 333...33 (100 threes). So, N = 3 * R_100, where R_100 is the repunit with 100 ones.So, N = 3 * R_100. Therefore, if I can find a repunit R_k divisible by both 3 and R_100, then R_k will be divisible by N. But since R_k is a number made up of ones, it's already divisible by 3 if k is a multiple of 3, because the sum of its digits will be a multiple of 3. So, if k is a multiple of 3, R_k is divisible by 3.Therefore, to have R_k divisible by N = 3 * R_100, R_k must be divisible by both 3 and R_100. Since R_k is divisible by 3 when k is a multiple of 3, the key is to find the smallest k such that R_k is divisible by R_100 and k is a multiple of 3.Wait, actually, R_100 is a repunit itself. So, perhaps I can use properties of repunits to find the minimal k.I remember that the divisibility of repunits relates to the concept of the multiplicative order. Specifically, the smallest k for which R_k is divisible by a number m is called the period of m, or the multiplicative order of 10 modulo m, but adjusted because repunits are (10^k - 1)/9.Let me recall: R_k = (10^k - 1)/9. So, R_k is divisible by m if and only if (10^k - 1)/9 ≡ 0 mod m, which implies that 10^k ≡ 1 mod 9m. Wait, is that correct?Wait, let's see. If R_k = (10^k - 1)/9, then R_k ≡ 0 mod m implies that (10^k - 1)/9 ≡ 0 mod m, which implies that 10^k - 1 ≡ 0 mod 9m, so 10^k ≡ 1 mod 9m.Therefore, the smallest k for which R_k is divisible by m is the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 9m. But wait, is that always true? Let me think.Actually, if m and 9 are coprime, then yes, because 10^k ≡ 1 mod 9m is equivalent to 10^k ≡ 1 mod m and 10^k ≡ 1 mod 9. But since 10 ≡ 1 mod 9, 10^k ≡ 1^k ≡ 1 mod 9, so the condition 10^k ≡ 1 mod 9 is automatically satisfied. Therefore, if m and 9 are coprime, then the multiplicative order of 10 modulo m is the same as the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 9m.But in our case, m is R_100, which is a repunit. Is R_100 coprime with 9? Let's check.R_100 is 111...11 (100 ones). The sum of its digits is 100, which is not a multiple of 9, so R_100 is not divisible by 9. Therefore, R_100 and 9 are coprime. So, in this case, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 9R_100 is equal to the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100.Wait, no. Let me clarify. If m and 9 are coprime, then the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 9m is equal to the least common multiple of the multiplicative orders modulo 9 and modulo m. But since 10 ≡ 1 mod 9, the multiplicative order modulo 9 is 1. Therefore, the multiplicative order modulo 9m is equal to the multiplicative order modulo m. So, yes, in this case, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 9R_100 is equal to the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100.Therefore, the minimal k such that R_k is divisible by R_100 is equal to the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100.But wait, hold on. R_100 is 111...11 (100 ones). So, R_100 is equal to (10^100 - 1)/9. So, R_100 = (10^100 - 1)/9.Therefore, if I can find the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100, that would give me the minimal k such that 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100. Then, R_k = (10^k - 1)/9 would be divisible by R_100.But wait, is that correct? Let me see. If 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100, then (10^k - 1)/9 ≡ 0 mod R_100, so R_k is divisible by R_100. So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, the minimal k is the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100.But R_100 is (10^100 - 1)/9, so perhaps we can find the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100.Alternatively, perhaps we can find the multiplicative order of 10 modulo N, where N = 3 * R_100. Since N is 3 * R_100, and 3 and R_100 are coprime (because R_100 is not divisible by 3, as the sum of its digits is 100, which is not a multiple of 3). Therefore, 3 and R_100 are coprime.Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo N is the least common multiple of the multiplicative orders modulo 3 and modulo R_100.So, let's compute the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 3 and modulo R_100.First, modulo 3: 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, so 10^1 ≡ 1 mod 3. Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 3 is 1.Next, modulo R_100: as before, the multiplicative order is the minimal k such that 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100.But since R_100 = (10^100 - 1)/9, 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100. So, 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100.But is 100 the minimal such k? Or is there a smaller k?Wait, R_100 divides (10^100 - 1)/9, so 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100. So, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 divides 100. So, the order could be a factor of 100.But is it possible that the order is less than 100? For example, if 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100 for some k < 100.But R_100 is a repunit, and repunits have interesting properties regarding their divisibility.I remember that for a repunit R_n, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_n is n, provided that R_n is prime. But R_100 is definitely not prime because 100 is not a prime number. So, R_100 is composite.Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 could be a factor of 100, but not necessarily 100 itself.Wait, but R_100 is (10^100 - 1)/9. So, 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100. Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 divides 100. So, the order is the minimal k such that k divides 100 and 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100.But since R_100 is a factor of (10^100 - 1)/9, 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100. So, the multiplicative order must divide 100.Therefore, the multiplicative order is the least common multiple of the orders modulo the prime factors of R_100.But R_100 is composite, so it's equal to the product of its prime factors. Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 is the least common multiple of the multiplicative orders modulo each prime factor.But since I don't know the prime factors of R_100, this might be difficult.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that R_100 divides (10^100 - 1)/9, so 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100. Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 divides 100. So, the order is a factor of 100.Therefore, the minimal k is the minimal factor of 100 such that 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100.But since R_100 is a large number, it's difficult to compute this directly.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that R_100 is a repunit, so it's related to the factors of 10^100 - 1.But 10^100 - 1 factors into (10^50 - 1)(10^50 + 1), and so on, recursively. But I don't know if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that R_100 is equal to (10^100 - 1)/9, so 9R_100 = 10^100 - 1.Therefore, 10^100 ≡ 1 mod 9R_100.But since 9 and R_100 are coprime (as R_100 is not divisible by 3), then 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100.So, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 divides 100.Therefore, the order is a factor of 100. So, the possible orders are the divisors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.But 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100. Let's test for k=1: 10^1=10. 10 mod R_100 is 10, which is not 1. So, k=1 is out.k=2: 10^2=100. 100 mod R_100 is 100, which is not 1. So, k=2 is out.k=4: 10^4=10000. 10000 mod R_100. Hmm, R_100 is 111...11 (100 ones). So, 10000 is much smaller than R_100, so 10000 mod R_100 is 10000, which is not 1. So, k=4 is out.k=5: 10^5=100000. Similarly, 100000 mod R_100 is 100000, not 1. So, k=5 is out.k=10: 10^10. Hmm, 10^10 is 10000000000. R_100 is about 1.111... x 10^99, so 10^10 is much smaller. So, 10^10 mod R_100 is 10^10, which is not 1. So, k=10 is out.k=20: 10^20. Similarly, 10^20 is 100000000000000000000, which is still much smaller than R_100 (which is 10^100 / 9). So, 10^20 mod R_100 is 10^20, not 1. So, k=20 is out.k=25: 10^25. Again, 10^25 is way smaller than R_100, so 10^25 mod R_100 is 10^25, not 1. So, k=25 is out.k=50: 10^50. Hmm, 10^50 is 1 followed by 50 zeros. R_100 is 111...11 (100 ones). So, 10^50 is less than R_100, because R_100 is about 1.111 x 10^99, while 10^50 is 1 x 10^50. So, 10^50 mod R_100 is 10^50, not 1. So, k=50 is out.k=100: 10^100. As we saw earlier, 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100. So, k=100 is a possible order.But is 100 the minimal k? Or is there a smaller k?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. When I thought that 10^k mod R_100 is 10^k, but that's only true if 10^k < R_100. But actually, 10^k mod R_100 is not necessarily 10^k if 10^k >= R_100.Wait, no. 10^k mod R_100 is the remainder when 10^k is divided by R_100. So, if 10^k < R_100, then the remainder is 10^k. But if 10^k >= R_100, then the remainder is 10^k - m*R_100 for some integer m.But in our case, for k=100, 10^100 is exactly equal to 9R_100 + 1, because R_100 = (10^100 - 1)/9. So, 10^100 = 9R_100 + 1. Therefore, 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100.Similarly, for k=50, 10^50 is less than R_100, so 10^50 mod R_100 is 10^50, which is not 1. So, k=50 is out.But wait, maybe for some k less than 100, 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100. How can I check that?Well, perhaps I can use the fact that R_100 divides (10^100 - 1)/9, so 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100. Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 divides 100. So, the order is a factor of 100.But to find the minimal k, I need to check the factors of 100 in ascending order to see if 10^k ≡ 1 mod R_100.But since R_100 is a very large number, it's impractical to compute 10^k mod R_100 for each k. So, maybe I can use some properties of repunits or number theory to find the order.Alternatively, perhaps I can note that R_100 is a factor of R_{100}, which is itself a factor of R_{200}, R_{300}, etc. But I'm not sure if that helps.Wait, another approach: since R_100 divides (10^100 - 1)/9, then 10^100 ≡ 1 mod R_100. So, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 must divide 100. So, the order is the least common multiple of the orders modulo the prime factors of R_100.But since R_100 is composite, it's equal to the product of its prime factors. So, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 is the least common multiple of the multiplicative orders modulo each prime factor.But without knowing the prime factors, it's hard to compute. However, perhaps R_100 has factors that are repunits with smaller numbers of ones, such as R_2, R_4, R_5, etc., but only if 100 is divisible by their lengths.Wait, actually, R_n divides R_m if and only if n divides m. So, for example, R_2 divides R_100 because 2 divides 100. Similarly, R_4 divides R_100, R_5 divides R_100, etc.Therefore, R_100 is divisible by R_d for each d that divides 100. So, R_100 is divisible by R_1, R_2, R_4, R_5, R_{10}, R_{20}, R_{25}, R_{50}, and R_{100}.But R_1 is 1, which doesn't affect divisibility. So, R_100 is divisible by R_2, R_4, R_5, R_{10}, R_{20}, R_{25}, R_{50}, and R_{100}.Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 must be a multiple of the multiplicative orders modulo each of these R_d.But the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_d is d, because R_d is a repunit, and 10^d ≡ 1 mod R_d.Wait, is that correct? Let's see.For R_d, which is (10^d - 1)/9, we have 10^d ≡ 1 mod R_d. So, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_d is d, provided that R_d is prime. But R_d is not necessarily prime.Wait, actually, even if R_d is composite, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_d is still d, because 10^d ≡ 1 mod R_d, and d is the minimal exponent for which this holds.Wait, no. For example, take R_2 = 11. The multiplicative order of 10 modulo 11 is 2 because 10^2 = 100 ≡ 1 mod 11. So, yes, the order is 2.Similarly, R_3 = 111. 10^3 = 1000 ≡ 1 mod 111, because 1000 - 1 = 999, which is divisible by 111. So, the order is 3.Similarly, R_4 = 1111. 10^4 = 10000. 10000 mod 1111: 10000 / 1111 is 9 with a remainder of 1. So, 10^4 ≡ 1 mod 1111. So, the order is 4.So, in general, for R_d, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_d is d.Therefore, since R_100 is divisible by R_d for each d dividing 100, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 must be a multiple of each d that divides 100.Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 is the least common multiple of all d where d divides 100.But wait, the least common multiple of all divisors of 100 is 100 itself, because 100 is the largest divisor.Wait, no. The least common multiple of the divisors of 100 is actually 100, because 100 is divisible by all its divisors.Wait, let me think again. The multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 must be a multiple of the multiplicative orders modulo each R_d, which are d. So, the multiplicative order modulo R_100 must be a multiple of each d where d divides 100.Therefore, the multiplicative order is the least common multiple of all d where d divides 100. But the least common multiple of all divisors of 100 is 100, because 100 is the largest divisor and all others divide it.Wait, but actually, the least common multiple of the divisors of 100 is 100. Because 100 is divisible by all its divisors, so LCM(1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100) = 100.Therefore, the multiplicative order of 10 modulo R_100 is 100.Therefore, the minimal k such that R_k is divisible by R_100 is 100.But wait, earlier I thought that R_100 divides R_k if k is a multiple of 100, but actually, R_100 divides R_k if and only if 100 divides k. Because R_n divides R_m if and only if n divides m.So, in this case, R_100 divides R_k if and only if 100 divides k. Therefore, the minimal k is 100.But wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier conclusion that the multiplicative order is 100. So, perhaps both conclusions agree.Therefore, the minimal k is 100. So, R_100 is divisible by R_100, obviously, and R_100 is the minimal such repunit.But wait, hold on. The original problem is to find the minimal k such that R_k is divisible by N = 3 * R_100.So, R_k must be divisible by both 3 and R_100.We already know that R_k is divisible by 3 if and only if k is a multiple of 3.And R_k is divisible by R_100 if and only if k is a multiple of 100.Therefore, the minimal k that satisfies both conditions is the least common multiple of 3 and 100.The LCM of 3 and 100 is 300, because 3 and 100 are coprime.Therefore, the minimal k is 300.Therefore, the smallest number composed exclusively of ones that is divisible by N = 333...33 (100 threes) is R_300, which is a repunit with 300 ones.Therefore, the answer is 300.But let me double-check this reasoning.First, N = 3 * R_100.We need R_k divisible by N.R_k is divisible by 3 if k is a multiple of 3.R_k is divisible by R_100 if k is a multiple of 100.Therefore, k must be a multiple of both 3 and 100, so the minimal k is LCM(3, 100) = 300.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, thinking in terms of modular arithmetic:We need R_k ≡ 0 mod N.Which is equivalent to R_k ≡ 0 mod 3 and R_k ≡ 0 mod R_100.R_k ≡ 0 mod 3 when k is a multiple of 3.R_k ≡ 0 mod R_100 when k is a multiple of 100.Therefore, the minimal k is the least common multiple of 3 and 100, which is 300.Therefore, the minimal number composed exclusively of ones divisible by N is R_300, which has 300 ones.Therefore, the answer is 300.**Final Answer**The smallest such number is composed of boxed{300} ones."},{"question":"Znayka told Neznaika that to convert kilolunes (a unit of mass used by the moon inhabitants) to kilograms, you need to divide the mass in kilolunes by 4 and reduce the resulting number by 4%. Neznaika decided that to convert from kilograms to kilolunes, you need to multiply the mass in kilograms by 4 and increase the resulting number by 4%. By what percentage will he be wrong from the correct mass value in kilolunes if he converts like this?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Znayka told Neznaika how to convert kilolunes to kilograms, and Neznaika tried to reverse the process to convert kilograms back to kilolunes. But apparently, Neznaika's method isn't correct, and I need to figure out by what percentage he'll be wrong. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's understand the conversion from kilolunes to kilograms as given by Znayka. She said that to convert kilolunes to kilograms, you need to divide the mass in kilolunes by 4 and then reduce the resulting number by 4%. So, if I have a mass in kilolunes, let's call it K, then the conversion to kilograms (let's denote that as kg) would be:kg = (K / 4) - 4% of (K / 4)Wait, actually, the problem says \\"divide the mass in kilolunes by 4 and reduce the resulting number by 4%.\\" So, that would be:kg = (K / 4) * (1 - 0.04) = (K / 4) * 0.96So, the formula is kg = 0.96 * (K / 4). Let me write that as:kg = (0.96 / 4) * KWhich simplifies to:kg = 0.24 * KSo, 1 kilolune is equal to 0.24 kilograms. That makes sense.Now, Neznaika tried to reverse this process. He thought that to convert kilograms back to kilolunes, you need to multiply by 4 and then increase by 4%. So, if he has a mass in kilograms, let's say M kg, he would compute:K_nez = M * 4 * 1.04Wait, let me make sure. The original conversion was kg = (K / 4) * 0.96, so to get K from kg, you would need to reverse the operations.Starting from kg = 0.24 * K, solving for K gives:K = kg / 0.24Which is the same as:K = (kg / 4) / 0.96But Neznaika instead did K_nez = M * 4 * 1.04. Let's see what that is.So, if the correct conversion is K = kg / 0.24, then Neznaika is using K_nez = 4 * 1.04 * kg = 4.16 * kg.Wait, so the correct conversion factor is 1 / 0.24, which is approximately 4.166666..., right? Because 1 divided by 0.24 is 4.166666...So, Neznaika is using 4.16 instead of 4.166666..., which is a slight difference. But wait, actually, let me compute 4 * 1.04.4 * 1.04 is 4.16. So, he's using 4.16 as the conversion factor, whereas the correct one is approximately 4.166666...So, the difference between Neznaika's conversion factor and the correct one is 4.166666... - 4.16 = 0.006666...So, the error is 0.006666... in the conversion factor. To find the percentage error, we can compute (error / correct value) * 100%.So, (0.006666... / 4.166666...) * 100% ≈ (0.006666 / 4.166666) * 100%.Calculating that:0.006666 / 4.166666 ≈ 0.0016So, 0.0016 * 100% ≈ 0.16%.Wait, that seems really small. Is that correct? Let me double-check.Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider a specific example to see the percentage error.Suppose we have a mass in kilograms, say M kg. Let's convert it to kilolunes using both the correct method and Neznaika's method, then find the percentage difference.First, correct conversion:K_correct = M / 0.24 ≈ M * 4.166666...Neznaika's conversion:K_nez = M * 4 * 1.04 = M * 4.16So, the difference between K_correct and K_nez is:ΔK = K_correct - K_nez = (4.166666... - 4.16) * M = 0.006666... * MSo, the percentage error is (ΔK / K_correct) * 100% = (0.006666... / 4.166666...) * 100%Which is approximately (0.006666 / 4.166666) * 100% ≈ 0.16%So, that seems consistent. So, Neznaika's method is off by approximately 0.16%.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should express it as a percentage of the correct value.Alternatively, sometimes percentage error is calculated as |(Experimental - Theoretical)| / |Theoretical| * 100%.So, in this case, Experimental is K_nez, Theoretical is K_correct.So, percentage error = |(K_nez - K_correct)| / K_correct * 100%Which is |(4.16 - 4.166666...)| / 4.166666... * 100% ≈ (0.006666...) / 4.166666... * 100% ≈ 0.16%So, yes, that's correct.But wait, let me think about another approach. Maybe using the original conversion formula.Znayka's formula: kg = 0.24 * KSo, to invert it, K = kg / 0.24Neznaika's formula: K_nez = 4 * 1.04 * kg = 4.16 * kgSo, the ratio of Neznaika's result to the correct result is:K_nez / K_correct = (4.16 * kg) / (kg / 0.24) = 4.16 * 0.24 ≈ 1.0Wait, 4.16 * 0.24 is 1.000... Wait, no, 4.16 * 0.24 is:4 * 0.24 = 0.960.16 * 0.24 = 0.0384So, total is 0.96 + 0.0384 = 0.9984So, K_nez / K_correct = 0.9984Which means K_nez = 0.9984 * K_correctSo, Neznaika's result is 0.9984 times the correct result, which is a decrease of 0.16%.Wait, so the percentage error is 0.16% less than the correct value.But percentage error is usually expressed as the absolute value, so it's 0.16% error.So, Neznaika's method gives a result that is 0.16% less than the correct value.But wait, let me confirm this calculation.4.16 * 0.24:4 * 0.24 = 0.960.16 * 0.24 = 0.0384Adding them together: 0.96 + 0.0384 = 0.9984Yes, that's correct.So, K_nez = 0.9984 * K_correctWhich means K_nez is 99.84% of K_correct, so the error is 100% - 99.84% = 0.16%So, Neznaika's method is underestimating the kilolunes by 0.16%.Alternatively, if we express it as a percentage of the correct value, it's a 0.16% error.So, the answer is 0.16%.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I should express it as a percentage difference in the other direction.Wait, if K_nez = 0.9984 * K_correct, then the percentage error is (1 - 0.9984) * 100% = 0.16%.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, if we consider the relative error, it's (K_nez - K_correct) / K_correct * 100% = (-0.0016) * 100% = -0.16%, meaning a 0.16% underestimate.So, the percentage error is 0.16%.Therefore, Neznaika will be wrong by approximately 0.16% from the correct mass value in kilolunes.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should approach this using algebra without plugging in numbers.Let me denote:Let K be the mass in kilolunes.Znayka's conversion: kg = (K / 4) * 0.96 = 0.24KSo, kg = 0.24KTherefore, K = kg / 0.24 = (1 / 0.24) kg ≈ 4.166666... kgNeznaika's method: K_nez = 4 * 1.04 * kg = 4.16 kgSo, the ratio K_nez / K = (4.16 kg) / (4.166666... kg) ≈ 0.9984So, K_nez = 0.9984 KTherefore, the error is K - K_nez = K - 0.9984K = 0.0016KSo, the percentage error is (0.0016K / K) * 100% = 0.16%Yes, that's consistent.So, regardless of the approach, the percentage error is 0.16%.Therefore, the answer is 0.16%.But wait, let me check if I can express this as a fraction.0.16% is 16/100%, which is 4/25%.But 0.16 is 16/100, which simplifies to 4/25, so 4/25%.But 4/25 is 0.16, so yes.Alternatively, 0.16% is 16 per ten thousand, or 4 per thousand.But in any case, 0.16% is the percentage error.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The percentage error is boxed{0.16%}."},{"question":"A proper divisor of a natural number is any of its divisors other than one and the number itself. Find all natural numbers that have at least two different proper divisors and are divisible by the difference of any two of them.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find all natural numbers that have at least two different proper divisors and are divisible by the difference of any two of them. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's understand what a proper divisor is. A proper divisor of a natural number is any divisor other than 1 and the number itself. So, for example, the proper divisors of 6 are 2 and 3. Got it.The problem says the number must have at least two different proper divisors. That means numbers like 4, which only have one proper divisor (2), won't qualify. So, we're looking for numbers with at least two proper divisors. Next, the number must be divisible by the difference of any two of its proper divisors. So, if a number has proper divisors d1, d2, d3, etc., then the number must be divisible by |d1 - d2|, |d1 - d3|, |d2 - d3|, and so on.Let me start by considering some small natural numbers and see if they fit the criteria.Let's take 6 first. Its proper divisors are 2 and 3. The difference between them is 1. Is 6 divisible by 1? Yes, because any number is divisible by 1. So, 6 seems to satisfy the condition. But wait, 6 only has two proper divisors, so there's only one difference to consider. So, 6 is okay.What about 8? Its proper divisors are 2 and 4. The difference is 2. Is 8 divisible by 2? Yes, because 8 divided by 2 is 4. So, 8 also satisfies the condition.Moving on to 10. Proper divisors are 2 and 5. The difference is 3. Is 10 divisible by 3? No, because 10 divided by 3 is approximately 3.333, which isn't an integer. So, 10 doesn't work.How about 12? Its proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, and 6. Let's compute the differences:- |2 - 3| = 1- |2 - 4| = 2- |2 - 6| = 4- |3 - 4| = 1- |3 - 6| = 3- |4 - 6| = 2Now, check if 12 is divisible by each of these differences: 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2. 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, yes, 12 satisfies the condition.Wait, but 12 has multiple proper divisors, so we have to check all possible differences. Since all differences are divisors of 12, it works.Let me check another number, say 14. Proper divisors are 2 and 7. The difference is 5. Is 14 divisible by 5? No, because 14 divided by 5 is 2.8, which isn't an integer. So, 14 doesn't work.How about 16? Proper divisors are 2, 4, and 8. Compute the differences:- |2 - 4| = 2- |2 - 8| = 6- |4 - 8| = 4Check if 16 is divisible by 2, 6, and 4. 16 is divisible by 2 and 4, but not by 6 because 16 divided by 6 is approximately 2.666. So, 16 doesn't satisfy the condition.Hmm, so 16 fails because 6 isn't a divisor of 16. Interesting.Let me try 18. Proper divisors are 2, 3, 6, 9. Compute the differences:- |2 - 3| = 1- |2 - 6| = 4- |2 - 9| = 7- |3 - 6| = 3- |3 - 9| = 6- |6 - 9| = 3Check if 18 is divisible by 1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 3. 18 is divisible by 1, 3, 6, but not by 4 or 7. So, 18 doesn't work.Wait, so 18 fails because 4 and 7 aren't divisors of 18. So, even though 18 has multiple proper divisors, the differences include numbers that aren't divisors of 18, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.Let me check 20. Proper divisors are 2, 4, 5, 10. Compute the differences:- |2 - 4| = 2- |2 - 5| = 3- |2 - 10| = 8- |4 - 5| = 1- |4 - 10| = 6- |5 - 10| = 5Check if 20 is divisible by 2, 3, 8, 1, 6, 5.20 is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20. So, 20 is divisible by 1, 2, 5, but not by 3, 6, or 8. Therefore, 20 doesn't satisfy the condition.Hmm, seems like numbers beyond 12 are failing because their differences include numbers that aren't divisors. Let me go back and see if there's a pattern.So far, 6, 8, and 12 satisfy the condition. Let me check 24.Proper divisors of 24: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12.Compute all differences:- |2 - 3| = 1- |2 - 4| = 2- |2 - 6| = 4- |2 - 8| = 6- |2 - 12| = 10- |3 - 4| = 1- |3 - 6| = 3- |3 - 8| = 5- |3 - 12| = 9- |4 - 6| = 2- |4 - 8| = 4- |4 - 12| = 8- |6 - 8| = 2- |6 - 12| = 6- |8 - 12| = 4Now, check if 24 is divisible by all these differences: 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 1, 3, 5, 9, 2, 4, 8, 2, 6, 4.24 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So, 24 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, but not by 5, 9, or 10. Therefore, 24 doesn't satisfy the condition.Hmm, so 24 fails because 5, 9, 10 aren't divisors of 24.Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Instead of checking each number, perhaps there's a property that such numbers must have.Let me consider the set of proper divisors. Let D be the set of proper divisors of n. The condition is that for any d1, d2 in D, n is divisible by |d1 - d2|.So, n must be divisible by all possible differences of its proper divisors.This seems like a strong condition. Maybe n has to be such that all differences of its proper divisors are also divisors of n.Wait, but in the case of 6, the difference is 1, which is a divisor. For 8, the difference is 2, which is a divisor. For 12, the differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, which are all divisors of 12.Wait, but 12 has differences like 1, 2, 3, 4, which are all divisors. So, maybe n must be such that all differences of its proper divisors are also divisors of n.But in that case, n must have a set of proper divisors where their differences are also divisors. That seems restrictive.Let me think about the structure of such numbers.Suppose n is a prime number. Then, it only has 1 and itself as divisors, so it doesn't have proper divisors. So, primes are out.If n is a composite number, it has at least one proper divisor. But we need at least two different proper divisors.So, n must be composite with at least two proper divisors.Now, let's think about the differences. For the differences to be divisors, the set of proper divisors must be closed under subtraction (up to absolute value). That is, the set D must satisfy that for any d1, d2 in D, |d1 - d2| is also in D or is 0 or n, but since we're taking absolute differences, it's non-negative.Wait, but 0 isn't a proper divisor, so we can ignore that. So, the differences must be either 1 or other proper divisors.But in the case of 6, the difference is 1, which is a divisor, but not a proper divisor. Wait, but the problem says the number must be divisible by the difference, not necessarily that the difference is a proper divisor. So, even if the difference is 1, which is a trivial divisor, it's acceptable.So, in the case of 6, the difference is 1, and 6 is divisible by 1, so it's okay.Similarly, for 8, the difference is 2, which is a proper divisor, so 8 is divisible by 2.For 12, the differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, which are all divisors (some are proper, some are not, but 1 is trivial). So, 12 is divisible by all of them.Wait, but in the case of 12, the differences include 1, which is a trivial divisor, and 2, 3, 4, which are proper divisors.So, perhaps n must be such that all differences of its proper divisors are either 1 or other proper divisors.But 1 is always a divisor, so as long as the differences are either 1 or proper divisors, n will be divisible by them.So, perhaps n must have a set of proper divisors where the differences between any two are either 1 or another proper divisor.This seems similar to the concept of a \\"divisor-closed\\" set, but not exactly.Alternatively, maybe n must be such that all its proper divisors form an arithmetic progression or something similar.Wait, let me think about 6. Its proper divisors are 2 and 3. The difference is 1, which is a divisor.For 8, proper divisors are 2 and 4. The difference is 2, which is a proper divisor.For 12, proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6. The differences are 1, 2, 3, 4. So, 1 is a divisor, 2, 3, 4 are proper divisors.Wait, so 12's differences include 1, which is not a proper divisor, but it's still a divisor. So, as long as the differences are either 1 or proper divisors, n is okay.So, maybe n must be such that the set of proper divisors is closed under subtraction, except that the differences can also be 1.Wait, but in 12, the differences include 1, which isn't a proper divisor, but it's still a divisor. So, n is okay because it's divisible by 1.So, perhaps n must have a set of proper divisors where the differences are either 1 or other proper divisors.But how can we characterize such numbers?Let me think about the structure of the proper divisors.Suppose n is a prime power, say p^k where p is prime and k >= 2.Then, the proper divisors of n are p, p^2, ..., p^{k-1}.Compute the differences between these divisors. For example, take n = 8 = 2^3. Proper divisors are 2 and 4. The difference is 2, which is a proper divisor. So, 8 works.Similarly, n = 9 = 3^2. Proper divisors are 3. Only one proper divisor, so it doesn't satisfy the condition of having at least two different proper divisors.n = 16 = 2^4. Proper divisors are 2, 4, 8. The differences are 2, 4, 6. 6 isn't a divisor of 16, so 16 doesn't work.Wait, so for prime powers, only when the number of proper divisors is two, like 8, does it work. Because with more proper divisors, the differences can lead to numbers that aren't divisors.So, 8 works because it has two proper divisors, 2 and 4, and their difference is 2, which is a proper divisor.Similarly, n = 27 = 3^3. Proper divisors are 3 and 9. The difference is 6, which isn't a divisor of 27. So, 27 doesn't work.So, only prime powers with exactly two proper divisors, like 8, 16 (but 16 doesn't work because it has three proper divisors), wait, no. Wait, 8 is 2^3, which has two proper divisors: 2 and 4. Their difference is 2, which is a proper divisor. So, 8 works.But 16 is 2^4, which has proper divisors 2, 4, 8. The differences are 2, 4, 6. 6 isn't a divisor, so 16 doesn't work.So, only prime powers with exactly two proper divisors, which would be p^3, because p^3 has proper divisors p and p^2, whose difference is p(p - 1). Wait, no, the difference is p^2 - p = p(p - 1). For this to be a divisor of p^3, p(p - 1) must divide p^3.So, p(p - 1) divides p^3. That implies that (p - 1) divides p^2. Since p and p - 1 are coprime, p - 1 must divide p^2. So, p - 1 divides p^2.But p is prime, so p - 1 must divide p^2. Since p and p - 1 are coprime, p - 1 must divide 1, because p^2 and p - 1 are coprime. So, p - 1 must be 1, which implies p = 2.Therefore, the only prime power with exactly two proper divisors where the difference is a proper divisor is when p = 2. So, n = 2^3 = 8.So, 8 is the only prime power that satisfies the condition.Now, let's think about composite numbers that are not prime powers.Take n = 6. Proper divisors are 2 and 3. The difference is 1, which is a divisor. So, 6 works.n = 12. Proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6. The differences are 1, 2, 3, 4. All of these are divisors of 12, so 12 works.n = 24. Proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12. The differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. 5, 9, 10 aren't divisors of 24, so 24 doesn't work.n = 18. Proper divisors are 2, 3, 6, 9. Differences include 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 4, 5, 7 aren't divisors of 18, so 18 doesn't work.n = 10. Proper divisors are 2, 5. Difference is 3, which isn't a divisor of 10, so 10 doesn't work.n = 14. Proper divisors are 2, 7. Difference is 5, which isn't a divisor of 14, so 14 doesn't work.n = 20. Proper divisors are 2, 4, 5, 10. Differences include 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10. 3, 6, 8 aren't divisors of 20, so 20 doesn't work.n = 28. Proper divisors are 2, 4, 7, 14. Differences include 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12. 3, 5, 6, 12 aren't divisors of 28, so 28 doesn't work.n = 30. Proper divisors are 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15. Differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15. 1 is a divisor, but 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 aren't divisors of 30, so 30 doesn't work.Wait, so 6, 8, 12 work, but others don't. Let me see if there's a pattern.6 is 2 * 3, which are primes. Its proper divisors are 2 and 3. The difference is 1, which is a divisor.8 is 2^3, as we discussed earlier.12 is 2^2 * 3. Its proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6. The differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, which are all divisors.So, 6, 8, 12 work. Let me check 24 again. Proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12. The differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. 5, 9, 10 aren't divisors, so 24 doesn't work.Wait, so 6, 8, 12 work. Let me check 24's multiples. Maybe 24 is too big.Wait, let me think about the structure of 6, 8, 12.6 is 2 * 3, which are primes.8 is 2^3.12 is 2^2 * 3.So, perhaps numbers that are either the product of two distinct primes or prime powers where the differences of their proper divisors are also divisors.Wait, but 6 is the product of two distinct primes, and 8 is a prime power.12 is a product of a prime squared and another prime.Let me see if 24 can be expressed similarly, but as we saw, it doesn't work.Wait, maybe the numbers that satisfy the condition are 6, 8, and 12.Let me check 24 again. Proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12. The differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. 5, 9, 10 aren't divisors of 24, so 24 doesn't work.Similarly, 18 has differences that include 5 and 7, which aren't divisors.So, maybe only 6, 8, and 12 satisfy the condition.Wait, let me check 28 again. Proper divisors are 2, 4, 7, 14. The differences include 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12. 3, 5, 6, 12 aren't divisors of 28, so 28 doesn't work.n = 30: differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15. Many aren't divisors.n = 16: differences include 2, 4, 6. 6 isn't a divisor, so 16 doesn't work.n = 10: differences include 3, which isn't a divisor.n = 14: differences include 5, which isn't a divisor.n = 20: differences include 3, 6, 8, which aren't divisors.n = 22: proper divisors are 2, 11. Difference is 9, which isn't a divisor.n = 24: as above, doesn't work.n = 36: proper divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18. Differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18. Many aren't divisors.So, seems like only 6, 8, 12 satisfy the condition.Wait, let me check 24 again. Maybe I made a mistake.Proper divisors of 24: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12.Differences:- 2-3=1- 2-4=2- 2-6=4- 2-8=6- 2-12=10- 3-4=1- 3-6=3- 3-8=5- 3-12=9- 4-6=2- 4-8=4- 4-12=8- 6-8=2- 6-12=6- 8-12=4So, the differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10.24 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So, 24 is not divisible by 5, 9, 10. Therefore, 24 doesn't satisfy the condition.So, 24 is out.Similarly, 18: differences include 5 and 7, which aren't divisors.So, seems like only 6, 8, 12 satisfy the condition.Wait, let me check 28 again. Proper divisors are 2, 4, 7, 14.Differences:- 2-4=2- 2-7=5- 2-14=12- 4-7=3- 4-14=10- 7-14=7So, differences are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12.28 is divisible by 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. So, 28 isn't divisible by 3, 5, 10, 12. Therefore, 28 doesn't work.Okay, so 6, 8, 12 seem to be the only numbers so far that satisfy the condition.Wait, let me check 30 again. Proper divisors are 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15.Differences:- 2-3=1- 2-5=3- 2-6=4- 2-10=8- 2-15=13- 3-5=2- 3-6=3- 3-10=7- 3-15=12- 5-6=1- 5-10=5- 5-15=10- 6-10=4- 6-15=9- 10-15=5So, differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13.30 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30. So, 30 isn't divisible by 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13. Therefore, 30 doesn't work.So, 6, 8, 12 are the only ones so far.Wait, let me check 24 again. Maybe I missed something.Wait, 24's differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. 24 isn't divisible by 5, 9, 10, so it doesn't work.Wait, let me think about 6, 8, 12.6: proper divisors 2, 3. Difference is 1, which is a divisor.8: proper divisors 2, 4. Difference is 2, which is a proper divisor.12: proper divisors 2, 3, 4, 6. Differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, which are all divisors.So, 6, 8, 12.Wait, let me check 24 again. Maybe if I consider more numbers, but I think it's clear that beyond 12, the differences start including numbers that aren't divisors.Wait, let me think about 24's proper divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12.If I take 2 and 3: difference is 1, which is a divisor.2 and 4: difference is 2, which is a proper divisor.2 and 6: difference is 4, which is a proper divisor.2 and 8: difference is 6, which is a proper divisor.2 and 12: difference is 10, which isn't a divisor.3 and 4: difference is 1, which is a divisor.3 and 6: difference is 3, which is a proper divisor.3 and 8: difference is 5, which isn't a divisor.3 and 12: difference is 9, which isn't a divisor.4 and 6: difference is 2, which is a proper divisor.4 and 8: difference is 4, which is a proper divisor.4 and 12: difference is 8, which is a proper divisor.6 and 8: difference is 2, which is a proper divisor.6 and 12: difference is 6, which is a proper divisor.8 and 12: difference is 4, which is a proper divisor.So, in 24, the differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. 5, 9, 10 aren't divisors, so 24 doesn't work.Therefore, 24 doesn't satisfy the condition.So, seems like only 6, 8, 12 satisfy the condition.Wait, let me check 28 again.Proper divisors: 2, 4, 7, 14.Differences:2-4=22-7=52-14=124-7=34-14=107-14=7So, differences are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12.28 is divisible by 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. So, 28 isn't divisible by 3, 5, 10, 12. Therefore, 28 doesn't work.Okay, so 6, 8, 12.Wait, let me check 30 again.Proper divisors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15.Differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13.30 isn't divisible by 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13. So, 30 doesn't work.So, seems like only 6, 8, 12.Wait, let me think about 24 again. Maybe if I consider numbers beyond 24, but I think the pattern is clear. The more proper divisors a number has, the more likely the differences will include numbers that aren't divisors.So, perhaps the only numbers that satisfy the condition are 6, 8, and 12.Wait, let me check 18 again.Proper divisors: 2, 3, 6, 9.Differences:2-3=12-6=42-9=73-6=33-9=66-9=3So, differences are 1, 3, 4, 6, 7.18 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. So, 18 isn't divisible by 4 or 7. Therefore, 18 doesn't work.Okay, so 6, 8, 12.Wait, let me check 24 one more time.Proper divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12.Differences include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10.24 isn't divisible by 5, 9, 10. So, 24 doesn't work.So, I think I've checked enough numbers, and only 6, 8, 12 satisfy the condition.Therefore, the natural numbers that have at least two different proper divisors and are divisible by the difference of any two of them are 6, 8, and 12."},{"question":"If varphi inleft(0, frac{pi}{2}right), which of the following conclusions is correct?A. sin (sin varphi)<cos varphi<cos (cos varphi)B. sin (sin varphi)>cos varphi>cos (cos varphi)C. sin (cos varphi)>cos varphi>cos (sin varphi)D. sin (cos varphi)<cos varphi<cos (sin varphi)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is correct when φ is between 0 and π/2. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand what each option is saying. Each option compares two or three expressions involving sine and cosine functions of φ, sin φ, and cos φ. Since φ is in the first quadrant (between 0 and π/2), both sin φ and cos φ will be positive. Also, since φ is less than π/2, cos φ will be greater than sin φ because cosine decreases from 1 to 0 and sine increases from 0 to 1 in this interval.So, for φ in (0, π/2), we have 0 < sin φ < cos φ < 1. That might be useful.Now, let's look at the options one by one.**Option A: sin(sin φ) < cos φ < cos(cos φ)**Hmm, okay. So, this is saying that sin(sin φ) is less than cos φ, which is less than cos(cos φ). Let me check each inequality.First, sin(sin φ). Since sin φ is between 0 and 1, sin(sin φ) will be between sin(0) = 0 and sin(1). Since sin(1) is approximately 0.8415. So, sin(sin φ) is less than about 0.8415.Now, cos φ is between 0 and 1 as well, but for φ in (0, π/2), cos φ is decreasing from 1 to 0. So, for example, when φ is π/4, cos φ is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071. So, sin(sin φ) at φ = π/4 would be sin(√2/2) ≈ sin(0.7071) ≈ 0.6496. So, 0.6496 < 0.7071, which is true. So, sin(sin φ) < cos φ seems to hold here.Now, the second inequality: cos φ < cos(cos φ). Let's test φ = π/4 again. cos φ = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071. Then, cos(cos φ) is cos(√2/2) ≈ cos(0.7071) ≈ 0.7602. So, 0.7071 < 0.7602, which is true. So, at φ = π/4, both inequalities hold.But let's test another value, say φ approaching 0. When φ approaches 0, sin φ approaches 0, so sin(sin φ) approaches sin(0) = 0. Cos φ approaches 1, and cos(cos φ) approaches cos(1) ≈ 0.5403. So, in this case, 0 < 1 is true, but 1 < 0.5403 is false. So, the second inequality doesn't hold when φ approaches 0. Therefore, Option A is not always true.Wait, but the question says φ is in (0, π/2), so φ can't be exactly 0, but it can get arbitrarily close. So, near φ = 0, cos φ is approaching 1, and cos(cos φ) is approaching cos(1). Since cos(1) is approximately 0.5403, which is less than 1. So, in that case, cos φ is greater than cos(cos φ). Therefore, the second inequality in Option A is false near φ = 0. So, Option A isn't correct for all φ in (0, π/2).**Option B: sin(sin φ) > cos φ > cos(cos φ)**Hmm, let's check this. Again, let's test φ = π/4. sin(sin φ) ≈ 0.6496, cos φ ≈ 0.7071, cos(cos φ) ≈ 0.7602. So, 0.6496 > 0.7071 is false. So, the first inequality is false. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**Option C: sin(cos φ) > cos φ > cos(sin φ)**Alright, let's test this one. Again, starting with φ = π/4. sin(cos φ) is sin(√2/2) ≈ sin(0.7071) ≈ 0.6496. cos φ is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071. So, 0.6496 > 0.7071 is false. So, the first inequality is false. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.Wait, maybe I should test another angle. Let's try φ = π/6. So, sin φ = 1/2, cos φ = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.Compute sin(cos φ) = sin(√3/2) ≈ sin(0.8660) ≈ 0.7616. Compare to cos φ ≈ 0.8660. So, 0.7616 > 0.8660? No, that's false. So, again, the first inequality is false. So, Option C is incorrect.**Option D: sin(cos φ) < cos φ < cos(sin φ)**Alright, let's check this. Starting with φ = π/4. sin(cos φ) ≈ sin(√2/2) ≈ 0.6496. cos φ ≈ 0.7071. So, 0.6496 < 0.7071, which is true.Now, the second inequality: cos φ < cos(sin φ). cos φ ≈ 0.7071, sin φ ≈ √2/2 ≈ 0.7071, so cos(sin φ) ≈ cos(√2/2) ≈ 0.7602. So, 0.7071 < 0.7602 is true. So, both inequalities hold at φ = π/4.Let me test another angle, say φ = π/6. sin φ = 1/2, cos φ = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.Compute sin(cos φ) = sin(√3/2) ≈ sin(0.8660) ≈ 0.7616. Compare to cos φ ≈ 0.8660. So, 0.7616 < 0.8660 is true.Now, cos φ ≈ 0.8660, and cos(sin φ) = cos(1/2) ≈ cos(0.5) ≈ 0.8776. So, 0.8660 < 0.8776 is true. So, both inequalities hold here as well.How about φ approaching 0? Let's see. When φ approaches 0, cos φ approaches 1, sin φ approaches 0.Compute sin(cos φ) approaches sin(1) ≈ 0.8415, which is less than 1. So, sin(cos φ) < cos φ holds.Now, cos φ approaches 1, and cos(sin φ) approaches cos(0) = 1. So, as φ approaches 0, cos φ approaches 1 from below, and cos(sin φ) approaches 1 from above? Wait, no. Let me think.Wait, as φ approaches 0, sin φ approaches 0, so cos(sin φ) approaches cos(0) = 1. But cos φ approaches 1 as well. So, we need to see the rate at which they approach 1.Let me compute the limit as φ approaches 0 of cos φ - cos(sin φ). Let's see:cos φ ≈ 1 - φ²/2 + φ⁴/24 - ...cos(sin φ) ≈ cos(φ - φ³/6 + ...) ≈ 1 - (φ - φ³/6)² / 2 + ...So, expanding cos(sin φ):First, sin φ ≈ φ - φ³/6.Then, cos(sin φ) ≈ 1 - (sin φ)^2 / 2 + (sin φ)^4 / 24 - ...So, (sin φ)^2 ≈ φ² - φ⁴/3 + ...Therefore, cos(sin φ) ≈ 1 - (φ² - φ⁴/3)/2 + (φ⁴)/24 - ... = 1 - φ²/2 + φ⁴/6 + φ⁴/24 - ... = 1 - φ²/2 + (φ⁴)(1/6 + 1/24) - ... = 1 - φ²/2 + (5φ⁴)/24 - ...Similarly, cos φ ≈ 1 - φ²/2 + φ⁴/24 - ...So, subtracting cos(sin φ) - cos φ ≈ [1 - φ²/2 + 5φ⁴/24] - [1 - φ²/2 + φ⁴/24] = (5φ⁴/24 - φ⁴/24) = 4φ⁴/24 = φ⁴/6.So, as φ approaches 0, cos(sin φ) - cos φ ≈ φ⁴/6 > 0. Therefore, cos(sin φ) > cos φ near φ = 0.So, near φ = 0, cos φ < cos(sin φ) holds.Similarly, sin(cos φ) approaches sin(1) ≈ 0.8415, which is less than 1, so sin(cos φ) < cos φ holds.Therefore, near φ = 0, both inequalities in Option D hold.How about near φ = π/2? Let's see.As φ approaches π/2, sin φ approaches 1, cos φ approaches 0.Compute sin(cos φ). As cos φ approaches 0, sin(cos φ) approaches sin(0) = 0. So, sin(cos φ) approaches 0, which is less than cos φ approaching 0? Wait, cos φ approaches 0 from the positive side, so 0 < cos φ near φ = π/2? Wait, no. When φ approaches π/2, cos φ approaches 0 from above, so cos φ is positive but approaching 0.So, sin(cos φ) approaches sin(0) = 0, but since cos φ is approaching 0 from above, sin(cos φ) is approaching 0 from above as well. So, sin(cos φ) is less than cos φ because sin(x) < x for x in (0, π/2). Since cos φ is in (0,1), which is within (0, π/2) approximately (since π/2 ≈ 1.5708). So, yes, sin(cos φ) < cos φ holds.Now, the second inequality: cos φ < cos(sin φ). As φ approaches π/2, sin φ approaches 1, so cos(sin φ) approaches cos(1) ≈ 0.5403. Meanwhile, cos φ approaches 0. So, 0 < 0.5403 is true. Therefore, cos φ < cos(sin φ) holds near φ = π/2.So, putting it all together, for φ in (0, π/2), Option D: sin(cos φ) < cos φ < cos(sin φ) seems to hold.Wait, let me test another angle, say φ = π/3. So, sin φ = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, cos φ = 1/2 = 0.5.Compute sin(cos φ) = sin(0.5) ≈ 0.4794. Compare to cos φ = 0.5. So, 0.4794 < 0.5 is true.Now, cos(sin φ) = cos(√3/2) ≈ cos(0.8660) ≈ 0.6459. Compare to cos φ = 0.5. So, 0.5 < 0.6459 is true. So, both inequalities hold here as well.Hmm, seems consistent. So, Option D is correct.But just to be thorough, let me check φ = π/6 again. sin φ = 0.5, cos φ ≈ 0.8660.sin(cos φ) = sin(0.8660) ≈ 0.7616 < 0.8660, which is true.cos(sin φ) = cos(0.5) ≈ 0.8776 > 0.8660, which is true. So, both inequalities hold.Another test: φ = π/12 (15 degrees). sin φ ≈ 0.2588, cos φ ≈ 0.9659.sin(cos φ) = sin(0.9659) ≈ sin(π/3.25) ≈ sin(1.505) ≈ 0.997. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, 0.9659 radians is approximately 55.5 degrees. So, sin(0.9659) ≈ sin(55.5°) ≈ 0.824.Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.9659 radians is about 55.5 degrees. sin(55.5°) ≈ 0.824.Compare to cos φ ≈ 0.9659. So, 0.824 < 0.9659, which is true.Now, cos(sin φ) = cos(0.2588) ≈ cos(14.85°) ≈ 0.968. So, 0.9659 < 0.968 is true.So, both inequalities hold here as well.Wait, but sin(cos φ) ≈ 0.824, which is less than cos φ ≈ 0.9659, and cos φ ≈ 0.9659 is less than cos(sin φ) ≈ 0.968. So, both inequalities hold.So, seems like Option D is correct across multiple test points.Just to make sure, let me think about the functions involved.We know that for x in (0, π/2), sin x < x < cos x? Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, for x in (0, π/2), sin x < x < tan x, but cos x is decreasing.Wait, perhaps I should consider the behavior of sin(cos φ) and cos(sin φ).Let me consider the function f(x) = sin(cos x). Since cos x is decreasing from 1 to 0 as x goes from 0 to π/2, sin(cos x) will be decreasing from sin(1) ≈ 0.8415 to sin(0) = 0.Similarly, the function g(x) = cos(sin x). Since sin x is increasing from 0 to 1, cos(sin x) is decreasing from cos(0) = 1 to cos(1) ≈ 0.5403.So, both f(x) and g(x) are decreasing functions on (0, π/2). But how do they compare to cos x?We have cos x is also decreasing from 1 to 0.So, let's compare f(x) = sin(cos x) and cos x.We can consider the difference: sin(cos x) - cos x. Let's see when this is positive or negative.At x = 0: sin(cos 0) - cos 0 = sin(1) - 1 ≈ 0.8415 - 1 = -0.1585 < 0.At x = π/2: sin(cos π/2) - cos π/2 = sin(0) - 0 = 0 - 0 = 0.But is sin(cos x) always less than cos x on (0, π/2)?Wait, let's take the derivative of h(x) = sin(cos x) - cos x.h'(x) = cos(cos x)*(-sin x) + sin x = sin x (1 - cos(cos x)).Since sin x > 0 for x in (0, π/2), and cos(cos x) < 1 because cos x < π/2 (since x > 0, cos x < 1 < π/2). So, 1 - cos(cos x) > 0. Therefore, h'(x) > 0 on (0, π/2). So, h(x) is increasing on (0, π/2).At x = 0, h(0) = sin(1) - 1 ≈ -0.1585 < 0.At x = π/2, h(π/2) = sin(0) - 0 = 0.So, h(x) increases from -0.1585 to 0. Therefore, h(x) < 0 on (0, π/2). So, sin(cos x) - cos x < 0, meaning sin(cos x) < cos x on (0, π/2). So, the first inequality in Option D holds.Now, let's consider the second inequality: cos x < cos(sin x).Define k(x) = cos(sin x) - cos x.Compute k(x). Let's see:At x = 0: cos(sin 0) - cos 0 = cos(0) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.At x = π/2: cos(sin π/2) - cos π/2 = cos(1) - 0 ≈ 0.5403 > 0.Compute the derivative k'(x):k'(x) = -sin(sin x)*cos x + sin x.So, k'(x) = sin x - sin(sin x)*cos x.Factor out sin x: sin x [1 - cos x * (sin(sin x)/sin x)].Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's see if we can determine the sign of k'(x).Note that sin(sin x) < sin x because sin x < π/2 and sin is increasing on [0, π/2]. So, sin(sin x) < sin x.Therefore, sin(sin x)/sin x < 1.So, cos x * (sin(sin x)/sin x) < cos x.But I'm not sure if that directly helps.Alternatively, let's consider specific values.At x = 0: k'(0) = sin 0 - sin(sin 0)*cos 0 = 0 - 0*1 = 0.At x approaching 0, let's do a Taylor expansion.k(x) = cos(sin x) - cos x.Expand cos(sin x):cos(sin x) ≈ 1 - (sin x)^2 / 2 + (sin x)^4 / 24 - ...Similarly, cos x ≈ 1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ...So, k(x) ≈ [1 - (sin x)^2 / 2 + (sin x)^4 / 24] - [1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24] = (- (sin x)^2 / 2 + (sin x)^4 / 24) - (-x²/2 + x⁴/24) = (- (sin²x - x²)/2 + (sin⁴x - x⁴)/24).Compute sin²x - x² ≈ (x² - x⁴/3) - x² = -x⁴/3.Similarly, sin⁴x - x⁴ ≈ (x⁴ - (2x⁶)/3) - x⁴ = -2x⁶/3.So, k(x) ≈ (- (-x⁴/3)/2 + (-2x⁶/3)/24 ) = (x⁴/6 - x⁶/36).So, near x = 0, k(x) ≈ x⁴/6 > 0. So, k(x) is positive near x = 0.At x = π/2, k(π/2) ≈ 0.5403 > 0.Compute k'(x) at x = π/4:k'(π/4) = sin(π/4) - sin(sin(π/4)) * cos(π/4).sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.sin(sin(π/4)) = sin(√2/2) ≈ 0.6496.cos(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.So, k'(π/4) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.6496 * 0.7071 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.459 ≈ 0.2481 > 0.So, k'(x) is positive at x = π/4.Similarly, at x approaching π/2, let's see:sin x approaches 1, so sin(sin x) approaches sin(1) ≈ 0.8415.cos x approaches 0.So, k'(x) = sin x - sin(sin x)*cos x ≈ 1 - 0.8415*0 ≈ 1 > 0.So, k'(x) is positive near π/2.At x = 0, k'(0) = 0, but k(x) is increasing from 0 to positive values.Therefore, k(x) is increasing on (0, π/2), starting from 0 and increasing to about 0.5403.Therefore, k(x) > 0 on (0, π/2). So, cos(sin x) - cos x > 0, meaning cos x < cos(sin x) on (0, π/2). So, the second inequality in Option D holds.Therefore, both inequalities in Option D hold for all φ in (0, π/2). So, Option D is correct.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Each of the 25 students received a grade of either \\"3\\", \\"4\\", or \\"5\\" for their test.

Find the cost price per box of pork zongzi and red bean zongzi.","answer":"First, I'll define the variables. Let ( p ) be the cost price per box of pork zongzi. Then, the cost price per box of red bean zongzi is ( p - 10 ) yuan.Next, I'll calculate the number of boxes purchased for each type of zongzi. The merchant spent 8000 yuan on pork zongzi, so the number of pork zongzi boxes is ( frac{8000}{p} ). Similarly, the number of red bean zongzi boxes is ( frac{6000}{p - 10} ).According to the problem, the merchant purchased the same number of pork zongzi and red bean zongzi.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand what the set ( M ) is. It's defined as all real numbers ( x ) that satisfy the equation ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ). So, essentially, I need to solve this quadratic equation to find the elements of ( M ).Quadratic equations can sometimes have two solutions, one solution, or no real solutions. Let me see. The equation is ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ). I remember that quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula: ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ). In this case, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -2 ), and ( c = 1 ).Plugging these into the formula: ( x = frac{-(-2) pm sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} ). Simplifying that, it becomes ( x = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 - 4}}{2} ). The discriminant here is ( 4 - 4 = 0 ). So, ( x = frac{2 pm 0}{2} ), which simplifies to ( x = frac{2}{2} = 1 ).Wait, so the equation has only one solution, ( x = 1 ). That means the set ( M ) is just ( {1} ). So, ( M ) is a singleton set containing only the element 1.Now, the question is asking for the number of subsets of ( M ). I remember that the number of subsets of a set is given by ( 2^n ), where ( n ) is the number of elements in the set. Since ( M ) has only one element, ( n = 1 ).Calculating the number of subsets: ( 2^1 = 2 ). So, there should be 2 subsets of ( M ). Let me list them to make sure. The subsets of ( {1} ) are the empty set ( emptyset ) and the set itself ( {1} ). Yep, that's two subsets.Wait, hold on. The original problem mentions ( a in mathbb{R} ). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again: \\"The number of subsets of the set ( M = {x | x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0, a in mathbb{R}} ) is ______.\\" So, in the set definition, it's ( x ) such that ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ) and ( a ) is a real number. Hmm, but ( a ) isn't mentioned in the equation. Is that a typo?Wait, maybe it's supposed to be ( x ) such that ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ) and ( x in mathbb{R} ). Because otherwise, ( a ) is just a real number, but it's not part of the equation or the set. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps ( a ) is a parameter in the equation, but in the given equation, it's not present. So, maybe it's just a typo, and they meant ( x in mathbb{R} ).Assuming that, then the set ( M ) is indeed ( {1} ), as we found earlier. So, the number of subsets is 2.Alternatively, if ( a ) is actually part of the equation, maybe the equation was supposed to be ( x^2 - 2ax + 1 = 0 ). That would make more sense, because then ( a ) is a parameter, and the set ( M ) would depend on ( a ). But in the problem statement, it's written as ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), so unless there's a typo, ( a ) isn't part of the equation.Wait, but the problem says \\"a ∈ ℝ\\", so maybe it's saying that ( a ) is a real number, but ( a ) isn't in the equation. Maybe the set ( M ) is defined for all real numbers ( a ), but that doesn't make much sense either because ( a ) isn't in the equation.Alternatively, perhaps the set ( M ) is defined as ( {x | x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0} ) and ( a ) is just a real number, but it's not part of the set definition. So, maybe it's just extra information, or perhaps it's a typo.Given that, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that ( M ) is the set of real solutions to ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), which is just ( {1} ). Therefore, the number of subsets is 2.But just to be thorough, let me consider the possibility that ( a ) is part of the equation. If the equation was ( x^2 - 2ax + 1 = 0 ), then the set ( M ) would depend on ( a ). Let's see what happens in that case.If the equation is ( x^2 - 2ax + 1 = 0 ), then the discriminant is ( (2a)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 4a^2 - 4 = 4(a^2 - 1) ). So, the discriminant is positive when ( a^2 - 1 > 0 ), which is when ( |a| > 1 ). Then, the equation has two distinct real roots. If ( |a| = 1 ), the discriminant is zero, so there's exactly one real root. If ( |a| < 1 ), the discriminant is negative, so there are no real roots.But in the problem statement, it's given that ( a in mathbb{R} ). So, depending on the value of ( a ), the set ( M ) can have 0, 1, or 2 elements.Wait, but the problem is asking for the number of subsets of ( M ). If ( M ) can vary depending on ( a ), then the number of subsets can be ( 2^0 = 1 ), ( 2^1 = 2 ), or ( 2^2 = 4 ). But the problem is asking for a specific number, not a range or something else. So, perhaps this interpretation isn't correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that ( a ) is a real number, but it's not part of the equation. So, perhaps ( M ) is just the set of real solutions to ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), which is ( {1} ), regardless of ( a ). So, the number of subsets is 2.Given that, I think the problem is probably just asking for the number of subsets of ( M ), where ( M ) is the solution set of the equation ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ), which is ( {1} ). So, the number of subsets is 2.But to make sure, let me think again. If ( M ) is ( {1} ), then its subsets are ( emptyset ) and ( {1} ). So, that's two subsets. So, the answer should be 2.Wait, but the problem says \\"a ∈ ℝ\\". Maybe it's saying that ( a ) is a real number, and ( M ) is the set of all ( x ) such that ( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ) for some ( a in mathbb{R} ). But that doesn't make much sense because ( a ) isn't in the equation. So, perhaps it's a misstatement.Alternatively, maybe ( M ) is defined as ( {x | x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0, x in mathbb{R}} ), which would make sense. So, in that case, ( M ) is ( {1} ), and the number of subsets is 2.Given all this, I think the answer is 2.**Final Answer**The number of subsets of the set ( M ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"What is the area of the cyclic quadrilateral with sides of length 4 cm, 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm?

Choose from the following options:A) 6 cm²B) 13 cm²C) 26 cm²D) 30 cm²E) 36 cm²","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the area of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides of lengths 4 cm, 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. They mentioned using Brahmagupta's formula, which is ( A = sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)} ), where ( s ) is half of the perimeter. Hmm, let me make sure I understand this correctly.First, I remember that a cyclic quadrilateral is one where all four vertices lie on a circle. That's important because Brahmagupta's formula only applies to cyclic quadrilaterals. So, I can use this formula here.The formula requires me to calculate the semi-perimeter ( s ) first. The semi-perimeter is half of the sum of all the sides. So, I need to add up all the sides and then divide by 2.Let me write that down:( s = frac{a + b + c + d}{2} )Given the sides are 4 cm, 5 cm, 7 cm, and 10 cm. So, plugging those in:( s = frac{4 + 5 + 7 + 10}{2} )Let me compute the numerator first:4 + 5 is 9, plus 7 is 16, plus 10 is 26. So, the perimeter is 26 cm. Therefore, the semi-perimeter ( s ) is 26 divided by 2, which is 13 cm.Alright, so ( s = 13 ) cm.Now, using Brahmagupta's formula, the area ( A ) is the square root of the product of ( (s - a) ), ( (s - b) ), ( (s - c) ), and ( (s - d) ).So, let me compute each term:First, ( s - a = 13 - 4 = 9 ) cm.Next, ( s - b = 13 - 5 = 8 ) cm.Then, ( s - c = 13 - 7 = 6 ) cm.Lastly, ( s - d = 13 - 10 = 3 ) cm.So, now I have all four terms: 9, 8, 6, and 3.Now, I need to multiply these together and then take the square root of the result.Let me compute the product step by step:First, multiply 9 and 8: 9 * 8 = 72.Then, multiply that result by 6: 72 * 6. Hmm, 70*6 is 420, and 2*6 is 12, so 420 + 12 = 432.Now, multiply 432 by 3: 432 * 3. Let's see, 400*3 is 1200, and 32*3 is 96, so 1200 + 96 = 1296.So, the product inside the square root is 1296.Therefore, the area ( A = sqrt{1296} ).Now, I need to find the square root of 1296. Hmm, I think 36 squared is 1296 because 30 squared is 900, and 35 squared is 1225, and 36 squared is 1296. Let me verify:36 * 36: 30*30=900, 30*6=180, 6*30=180, 6*6=36. So, adding them up: 900 + 180 + 180 + 36 = 1296. Yep, that's correct.So, the area is 36 cm².Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake in calculations.So, sides: 4,5,7,10. Semi-perimeter: (4+5+7+10)/2 = 26/2=13. Then, (13-4)=9, (13-5)=8, (13-7)=6, (13-10)=3. Multiply them: 9*8=72, 72*6=432, 432*3=1296. Square root of 1296 is 36. So, yes, that seems correct.But wait, looking at the options, option E is 36 cm². But I remember sometimes in cyclic quadrilaterals, if the sides don't satisfy certain conditions, the quadrilateral might not be possible. Is this quadrilateral actually possible?Let me check the triangle inequality for quadrilaterals. The sum of any three sides should be greater than the fourth side.So, 4 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is greater than 10.4 + 5 + 10 = 19, which is greater than 7.4 + 7 + 10 = 21, which is greater than 5.5 + 7 + 10 = 22, which is greater than 4.So, all the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, such a quadrilateral exists.Additionally, since it's cyclic, Brahmagupta's formula applies. So, the area should indeed be 36 cm².Wait, but in the options, 36 is option E. But I recall sometimes the maximum area for a quadrilateral is achieved when it's cyclic, so maybe that's why it's 36.But let me think again. Did I compute the semi-perimeter correctly? 4+5+7+10 is 26, so semi is 13. Then, 13-4=9, 13-5=8, 13-7=6, 13-10=3. 9*8=72, 72*6=432, 432*3=1296. Square root of 1296 is 36. So, yes, that seems correct.But wait, another thought: sometimes, when the quadrilateral is not just cyclic but also has certain properties, the area can be different. But in this case, since it's given as cyclic, Brahmagupta's formula should hold.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication? Let me recompute the product:9 * 8 * 6 * 3.Let me group them differently: 9 * 3 = 27, and 8 * 6 = 48. Then, 27 * 48.27 * 48: 20*48=960, 7*48=336, so 960 + 336 = 1296. Yep, same result.So, square root is 36. So, the area is 36 cm², which is option E.Wait, but looking back at the options, option E is 36, which is what I got. So, that should be the answer.But hold on, just to make sure, sometimes when I compute semi-perimeter, I might have messed up, but 4+5+7+10 is definitely 26, so semi is 13. Then, subtracting each side: 13-4=9, 13-5=8, 13-7=6, 13-10=3. So, all correct.Another way to think about it: maybe I can compute the area using another method to verify? But since it's cyclic, Brahmagupta's formula is the standard method. Alternatively, maybe using Bretschneider's formula, but that requires knowing the sum of two opposite angles, which we don't have here.Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the area of a quadrilateral with given sides, but that's more complicated and not necessary here since Brahmagupta's formula is straightforward.So, I think I can confidently say that the area is 36 cm², which is option E.Wait, but hold on, the options are A) 6, B)13, C)26, D)30, E)36. So, 36 is an option, so that's E.But just to make sure, maybe I can think about whether 36 is a reasonable area for these sides.Given the sides are 4,5,7,10. The largest side is 10, so if it were a triangle with sides 4,5,10, that wouldn't be possible because 4+5=9 <10. But since it's a quadrilateral, it's okay.But in terms of area, 36 seems a bit large? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about the maximum possible area for a quadrilateral with these sides.Wait, for a cyclic quadrilateral, the area is maximized, so 36 is the maximum possible area for these sides. So, if it's cyclic, 36 is correct.Alternatively, if it wasn't cyclic, the area would be less. So, since it's cyclic, 36 is correct.Therefore, I think I'm confident that the answer is E) 36 cm².**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"On the number line, point A represents the number 3+x, and point B represents the number 3-x.

Point ( A ) is at ( 3 + x ) and point ( B ) is at ( 3 - x ).The distance between two points on a number line is the absolute difference of their positions.

Let me try to parse it step by step. First, the problem defines a positive integer ( n geq 2 ) as *junk* if there exist two distinct ( n )-digit binary strings ( a_1a_2cdots a_n ) and ( b_1b_2cdots b_n ) such that three conditions are satisfied:1. ( a_1 + a_2 = b_1 + b_2 )2. For all ( 2 leq i leq n-1 ), ( a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1} = b_{i-1} + b_i + b_{i+1} )3. ( a_{n-1} + a_n = b_{n-1} + b_n )So, essentially, we're looking for binary strings that are different but have the same sums in specific overlapping windows. The first and last windows are of size 2, and the middle windows are of size 3. My goal is to figure out for which ( n ) this is possible, and then count how many such ( n ) are less than or equal to 2016.Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can model this problem as a system of equations or something similar. Since the strings are binary, each ( a_i ) and ( b_i ) is either 0 or 1. Let me denote the difference between the two strings as ( c_i = a_i - b_i ). Since ( a_i ) and ( b_i ) are binary, ( c_i ) can be -1, 0, or 1. But since the strings are distinct, there must be at least one ( i ) where ( c_i neq 0 ).Now, let's translate the given conditions into equations involving ( c_i ).1. The first condition is ( a_1 + a_2 = b_1 + b_2 ). Subtracting both sides, we get ( (a_1 - b_1) + (a_2 - b_2) = 0 ), which is ( c_1 + c_2 = 0 ).2. The second condition is for each ( 2 leq i leq n-1 ), ( a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1} = b_{i-1} + b_i + b_{i+1} ). Subtracting, we get ( c_{i-1} + c_i + c_{i+1} = 0 ).3. The third condition is ( a_{n-1} + a_n = b_{n-1} + b_n ), which similarly gives ( c_{n-1} + c_n = 0 ).So, summarizing, we have the following system of equations:- ( c_1 + c_2 = 0 )- For ( 2 leq i leq n-1 ): ( c_{i-1} + c_i + c_{i+1} = 0 )- ( c_{n-1} + c_n = 0 )And ( c_i in { -1, 0, 1 } ), with at least one ( c_i neq 0 ).So, the problem reduces to finding if there exists a non-zero sequence ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n ) with entries in { -1, 0, 1 } satisfying the above equations.This seems like a linear algebra problem over the integers, but since we're dealing with a system of equations, maybe we can model it as a recurrence relation or something similar.Let me write down the equations:1. ( c_1 + c_2 = 0 ) => ( c_2 = -c_1 )2. For ( i = 2 ): ( c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0 )3. For ( i = 3 ): ( c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 0 )4. ...5. For ( i = n-1 ): ( c_{n-2} + c_{n-1} + c_n = 0 )6. ( c_{n-1} + c_n = 0 ) => ( c_n = -c_{n-1} )So, starting from the first equation, ( c_2 = -c_1 ). Then, for ( i = 2 ), substituting ( c_2 ) into the second equation:( c_1 + (-c_1) + c_3 = 0 ) => ( 0 + c_3 = 0 ) => ( c_3 = 0 )Moving to ( i = 3 ): ( c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 0 ) => ( (-c_1) + 0 + c_4 = 0 ) => ( c_4 = c_1 )Next, ( i = 4 ): ( c_3 + c_4 + c_5 = 0 ) => ( 0 + c_1 + c_5 = 0 ) => ( c_5 = -c_1 )Continuing, ( i = 5 ): ( c_4 + c_5 + c_6 = 0 ) => ( c_1 + (-c_1) + c_6 = 0 ) => ( 0 + c_6 = 0 ) => ( c_6 = 0 )Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me list out the ( c_i ) in terms of ( c_1 ):- ( c_1 = c_1 )- ( c_2 = -c_1 )- ( c_3 = 0 )- ( c_4 = c_1 )- ( c_5 = -c_1 )- ( c_6 = 0 )- ( c_7 = c_1 )- ( c_8 = -c_1 )- ( c_9 = 0 )- ...So, it seems that the sequence ( c_i ) is periodic with period 3: ( c_1, -c_1, 0, c_1, -c_1, 0, ldots )This pattern continues until we reach the last equation, which is ( c_{n-1} + c_n = 0 ). So, let's see what ( c_{n-1} ) and ( c_n ) would be in terms of ( c_1 ).Given the periodicity, the indices go as follows:- If ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( c_{n} = c_1 )- If ( n equiv 2 mod 3 ), then ( c_{n} = -c_1 )- If ( n equiv 0 mod 3 ), then ( c_{n} = 0 )Similarly, ( c_{n-1} ):- If ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ), then ( c_{n-1} = -c_1 )- If ( n equiv 2 mod 3 ), then ( c_{n-1} = 0 )- If ( n equiv 0 mod 3 ), then ( c_{n-1} = c_1 )So, let's plug into the last equation ( c_{n-1} + c_n = 0 ):Case 1: ( n equiv 1 mod 3 )Then, ( c_{n-1} = -c_1 ) and ( c_n = c_1 ). So, ( -c_1 + c_1 = 0 ), which is always true. So, no additional constraints here.Case 2: ( n equiv 2 mod 3 )Then, ( c_{n-1} = 0 ) and ( c_n = -c_1 ). So, ( 0 + (-c_1) = 0 ) => ( -c_1 = 0 ) => ( c_1 = 0 ). But if ( c_1 = 0 ), then all ( c_i = 0 ), which contradicts the requirement that the strings are distinct. So, in this case, there is no non-zero solution.Case 3: ( n equiv 0 mod 3 )Then, ( c_{n-1} = c_1 ) and ( c_n = 0 ). So, ( c_1 + 0 = 0 ) => ( c_1 = 0 ). Again, this leads to all ( c_i = 0 ), which is not allowed.Therefore, the only case where we can have a non-zero solution is when ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ). In that case, the last equation is automatically satisfied, and we can choose ( c_1 ) to be either 1 or -1, leading to a non-zero sequence.So, putting it all together, ( n ) is junk if and only if ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ). Therefore, the junk numbers are those congruent to 1 modulo 3.Now, the question is to find the number of junk positive integers less than or equal to 2016. So, we need to count how many integers ( n ) satisfy ( 2 leq n leq 2016 ) and ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ).Wait, hold on. The problem states ( n geq 2 ). So, the smallest ( n ) we need to consider is 2. But ( 2 equiv 2 mod 3 ), which is not 1 mod 3. So, the first possible junk number is 4, since 4 ≡ 1 mod 3.Wait, let me check: 1 mod 3 is 1, but n must be at least 2. So, the first n is 4, then 7, 10, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 2016.So, we need to find the number of integers in the arithmetic progression starting at 4, with common difference 3, up to 2016.Let me denote the sequence as 4, 7, 10, ..., L, where L ≤ 2016.To find the number of terms, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression:( a_k = a_1 + (k - 1)d )Here, ( a_1 = 4 ), ( d = 3 ), and ( a_k leq 2016 ).So, ( 4 + (k - 1) times 3 leq 2016 )Simplify:( (k - 1) times 3 leq 2012 )( k - 1 leq 2012 / 3 )Calculating 2012 / 3: 3 × 670 = 2010, so 2012 / 3 = 670 + 2/3 ≈ 670.666...So, ( k - 1 leq 670.666... ), so ( k - 1 = 670 ), so ( k = 671 ).Therefore, there are 671 terms in this sequence.But wait, let me verify:Compute the last term: ( a_{671} = 4 + (671 - 1) times 3 = 4 + 670 × 3 = 4 + 2010 = 2014 ). But 2014 is less than 2016. So, is there a larger term?Wait, 2014 + 3 = 2017, which is greater than 2016, so 2014 is indeed the last term. So, the number of terms is 671.But hold on, let's check if 2014 is indeed congruent to 1 mod 3.2014 divided by 3: 3 × 671 = 2013, so 2014 = 2013 + 1, so 2014 ≡ 1 mod 3. Correct.But wait, hang on. The first term is 4, which is 1 mod 3, and the last term is 2014, which is also 1 mod 3. So, the number of terms is indeed 671.But let me cross-verify using another method. The number of integers ≤ N and ≡ a mod m is given by floor((N - a)/m) + 1, provided that a ≤ N.In our case, a = 1, m = 3, N = 2016.So, number of terms = floor((2016 - 1)/3) + 1 = floor(2015/3) + 1.2015 divided by 3 is 671.666..., so floor is 671, then +1 is 672.Wait, but that counts numbers from 1 to 2016 congruent to 1 mod 3. But our sequence starts at 4, which is 1 mod 3, but 1 is also 1 mod 3 but less than 2. So, in our problem, n must be ≥ 2, so we need to exclude n=1.So, the total numbers ≡1 mod 3 from 1 to 2016 is 672, but since n must be ≥2, we subtract 1 (for n=1) to get 671.Therefore, the number of junk numbers ≤2016 is 671.Wait, but let me confirm:Compute how many numbers ≡1 mod 3 from 1 to 2016:Number of terms = floor((2016 - 1)/3) + 1 = floor(2015/3) + 1 = 671 + 1 = 672.But since n must be ≥2, we have to exclude n=1. So, 672 - 1 = 671. So, yes, 671.But hold on, is n=4 the first junk number? Let me test n=2 and n=3.For n=2: We need two distinct 2-digit binary strings where a1 + a2 = b1 + b2. Since it's binary, the possible sums are 0,1,2.But for two distinct strings, the only way their sums can be equal is if they are permutations of each other. For example, \\"01\\" and \\"10\\" both have sum 1. So, for n=2, such strings exist. Wait, but according to our earlier conclusion, n=2 is not ≡1 mod 3, so it shouldn't be junk. But here, it seems that n=2 is junk.Wait, hold on. Maybe my earlier analysis is flawed.Wait, let me go back. For n=2, the conditions are:1. a1 + a2 = b1 + b22. Since n=2, there are no middle terms, so no conditions for i=2 to n-1, which would be i=2 to 1, which is empty.3. a_{n-1} + a_n = b_{n-1} + b_n, which is a1 + a2 = b1 + b2, same as condition 1.So, for n=2, the only condition is that a1 + a2 = b1 + b2. So, as I said, \\"01\\" and \\"10\\" are distinct and satisfy this. So, n=2 is junk.But according to my earlier conclusion, n must be ≡1 mod 3. But 2 ≡ 2 mod 3, so that contradicts.So, perhaps my earlier analysis was incomplete.Wait, let's re-examine the equations for n=2.For n=2, the equations are:1. c1 + c2 = 02. c_{n-1} + c_n = 0, which is c1 + c2 = 0, same as condition 1.So, the only equation is c1 + c2 = 0. So, c2 = -c1.Since c1 and c2 are in {-1,0,1}, possible solutions are:- c1=1, c2=-1- c1=-1, c2=1- c1=0, c2=0But since the strings are distinct, c1 and c2 cannot both be 0. So, the non-zero solutions are c1=1, c2=-1 and c1=-1, c2=1.Therefore, for n=2, there exist non-zero solutions, so n=2 is junk.Similarly, let's check n=3.For n=3, the equations are:1. c1 + c2 = 02. For i=2: c1 + c2 + c3 = 03. c2 + c3 = 0From equation 1: c2 = -c1From equation 3: c3 = -c2 = c1From equation 2: c1 + (-c1) + c1 = 0 => 0 + c1 = 0 => c1=0Thus, c1=0, which implies c2=0 and c3=0. So, only the trivial solution exists. Therefore, no non-zero solutions, so n=3 is not junk.Wait, so n=2 is junk, n=3 is not, n=4 is junk, n=5: let's check.For n=4, the equations are:1. c1 + c2 = 0 => c2 = -c12. For i=2: c1 + c2 + c3 = 0 => c1 - c1 + c3 = 0 => c3 = 03. For i=3: c2 + c3 + c4 = 0 => -c1 + 0 + c4 = 0 => c4 = c14. c3 + c4 = 0 => 0 + c4 = 0 => c4 = 0But from equation 3, c4 = c1, so c1 = 0. Therefore, c1=0, c2=0, c3=0, c4=0. Only trivial solution. Wait, but earlier I thought n=4 is junk. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.Wait, hold on. Let me think again.Wait, for n=4, the equations are:1. c1 + c2 = 02. For i=2: c1 + c2 + c3 = 03. For i=3: c2 + c3 + c4 = 04. c3 + c4 = 0From equation 1: c2 = -c1From equation 2: c1 + (-c1) + c3 = 0 => 0 + c3 = 0 => c3 = 0From equation 4: c3 + c4 = 0 => 0 + c4 = 0 => c4 = 0From equation 3: c2 + c3 + c4 = (-c1) + 0 + 0 = -c1 = 0 => c1 = 0Thus, again, only the trivial solution. So, n=4 is not junk?But wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm.Wait, perhaps my initial assumption that n ≡1 mod 3 is the only case is wrong. Maybe I need to analyze it differently.Wait, let's think about n=2: it's possible.n=3: not possible.n=4: Let's try to find two distinct binary strings.Let me try to construct such strings.For n=4, let's try:a = 0000b = 0000: same, not distinct.a = 0001b = 0010: Let's check the conditions.First condition: a1 + a2 = 0 + 0 = 0; b1 + b2 = 0 + 0 = 0. Okay.Middle conditions:For i=2: a1 + a2 + a3 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0; b1 + b2 + b3 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. Not equal. So, doesn't satisfy.Another attempt:a = 0011b = 0101Check first condition: a1 + a2 = 0 + 0 = 0; b1 + b2 = 0 + 1 = 1. Not equal.Another try:a = 0101b = 1010First condition: a1 + a2 = 0 + 1 = 1; b1 + b2 = 1 + 0 = 1. Equal.Middle conditions:i=2: a1 + a2 + a3 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1; b1 + b2 + b3 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. Not equal.Hmm.Wait, maybe n=4 is not possible? But earlier, I thought n=4 is junk because 4 ≡1 mod 3. But with n=4, it seems that the system only has the trivial solution, so n=4 is not junk.Wait, so my earlier conclusion was wrong. So, perhaps n=2 is the only even case, and then n=5?Wait, let's try n=5.For n=5, the equations are:1. c1 + c2 = 0 => c2 = -c12. For i=2: c1 + c2 + c3 = 0 => c1 - c1 + c3 = 0 => c3 = 03. For i=3: c2 + c3 + c4 = 0 => -c1 + 0 + c4 = 0 => c4 = c14. For i=4: c3 + c4 + c5 = 0 => 0 + c1 + c5 = 0 => c5 = -c15. c4 + c5 = 0 => c1 + (-c1) = 0 => 0 = 0So, the equations are consistent and we can have non-zero solutions. For example, set c1=1, then c2=-1, c3=0, c4=1, c5=-1.So, the difference sequence is [1, -1, 0, 1, -1]. So, the binary strings a and b would differ by this sequence.Let me construct such strings.Let me choose a = [0,0,0,0,0]. Then b = a + c (mod 2, but since c_i are -1,0,1, we need to adjust).Wait, actually, since a and b are binary, c_i = a_i - b_i, so b_i = a_i - c_i.But c_i can be -1, which would mean b_i = a_i +1 mod 2.So, for a = [0,0,0,0,0], c = [1, -1, 0, 1, -1], then b = [0 -1, 0 +1, 0 -0, 0 -1, 0 +1] mod 2.Wait, but -1 mod 2 is 1, so:b1 = 0 -1 = -1 ≡1 mod 2b2 = 0 +1 =1b3 = 0 -0 =0b4 =0 -1 = -1 ≡1 mod 2b5 =0 +1 =1So, b = [1,1,0,1,1]Let me check if a and b satisfy the conditions.First condition: a1 + a2 = 0 + 0 =0; b1 + b2 =1 +1=2. Wait, 0 ≠2. Hmm, that's a problem.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in constructing b.Wait, actually, the difference c_i = a_i - b_i, so b_i = a_i - c_i. But since a_i and b_i are binary, we need to make sure that b_i is either 0 or 1.So, if c_i =1, then b_i = a_i -1. If a_i=0, then b_i = -1, which is invalid. So, perhaps my approach is flawed.Alternatively, maybe I should construct a and b such that their difference is c, but ensuring that both are binary.Alternatively, perhaps I can set a_i = b_i + c_i mod 2, but considering that c_i can be -1,0,1.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, I should pick a specific a and b.Let me try a = 00000 and b = 11011.Check the conditions:First condition: a1 + a2 =0 +0=0; b1 + b2=1 +1=2. Not equal. Hmm.Another try: a=00110, b=01001.First condition: a1 + a2=0 +0=0; b1 + b2=0 +1=1. Not equal.Wait, maybe it's tricky to construct manually. Let me instead think about the equations.From the equations, for n=5, we have a non-trivial solution, so such strings must exist. Therefore, n=5 is junk.Wait, so n=2 is junk, n=3 not, n=4 not, n=5 junk.Wait, so maybe the pattern is different. Let me see:n=2: junkn=3: notn=4: notn=5: junkn=6: ?Let me test n=6.For n=6, the equations are:1. c1 + c2 =0 => c2=-c12. For i=2: c1 + c2 + c3=0 => c1 -c1 +c3=0 => c3=03. For i=3: c2 + c3 + c4=0 => -c1 +0 +c4=0 => c4=c14. For i=4: c3 + c4 + c5=0 =>0 +c1 +c5=0 =>c5=-c15. For i=5: c4 + c5 + c6=0 =>c1 -c1 +c6=0 =>c6=06. c5 + c6=0 => -c1 +0=0 =>c1=0Thus, c1=0, leading to all c_i=0. So, only trivial solution. Therefore, n=6 is not junk.Wait, so n=2 and n=5 are junk, n=3,4,6 not.Wait, n=2: 2 mod 3=2n=5:5 mod3=2Wait, so n=2 and n=5 are both 2 mod3.Wait, but earlier, for n=4, which is 1 mod3, I thought it was junk, but actually, it's not. So, my initial conclusion was wrong.Wait, perhaps the correct condition is n ≡2 mod3?But n=2 and n=5 are 2 mod3, and they are junk, while n=3,4,6 are not.Wait, let's check n=8.n=8: Let's see.The equations:1. c1 + c2=0 =>c2=-c12. i=2: c1 +c2 +c3=0 =>c3=03. i=3: c2 +c3 +c4=0 => -c1 +0 +c4=0 =>c4=c14. i=4: c3 +c4 +c5=0 =>0 +c1 +c5=0 =>c5=-c15. i=5: c4 +c5 +c6=0 =>c1 -c1 +c6=0 =>c6=06. i=6: c5 +c6 +c7=0 =>-c1 +0 +c7=0 =>c7=c17. i=7: c6 +c7 +c8=0 =>0 +c1 +c8=0 =>c8=-c18. c7 +c8=0 =>c1 -c1=0 =>0=0So, the equations are consistent, and we can have non-zero solutions. For example, set c1=1, then c2=-1, c3=0, c4=1, c5=-1, c6=0, c7=1, c8=-1.So, the difference sequence is [1,-1,0,1,-1,0,1,-1]Thus, n=8 is junk.Similarly, n=8 is 2 mod3 (8 mod3=2). So, n=2,5,8,... are junk.Wait, so the correct condition is n ≡2 mod3.But wait, n=2:2 mod3=2; n=5:5 mod3=2; n=8:8 mod3=2.So, the pattern is n ≡2 mod3.But earlier, for n=4, which is 1 mod3, we saw that it's not junk, and for n=7, which is 1 mod3, let's check.n=7:Equations:1. c1 +c2=0 =>c2=-c12. i=2: c1 +c2 +c3=0 =>c3=03. i=3: c2 +c3 +c4=0 =>-c1 +0 +c4=0 =>c4=c14. i=4: c3 +c4 +c5=0 =>0 +c1 +c5=0 =>c5=-c15. i=5: c4 +c5 +c6=0 =>c1 -c1 +c6=0 =>c6=06. i=6: c5 +c6 +c7=0 =>-c1 +0 +c7=0 =>c7=c17. c6 +c7=0 =>0 +c1=0 =>c1=0Thus, only trivial solution. So, n=7 is not junk.Therefore, the correct condition is n ≡2 mod3.So, the junk numbers are those n ≥2 with n ≡2 mod3.So, now, the problem is to count the number of integers n with 2 ≤n ≤2016 and n ≡2 mod3.So, the sequence is 2,5,8,..., up to the largest number ≤2016.Let me compute the number of terms.The first term a1=2, common difference d=3, last term an ≤2016.Compute an=2 + (k-1)*3 ≤2016So, (k-1)*3 ≤2014k-1 ≤2014/3≈671.333...Thus, k-1=671, so k=672.Wait, but let's check:an=2 + 671*3=2 +2013=2015.2015 is ≤2016, so yes, the last term is 2015.So, the number of terms is 672.But wait, let me verify:Number of integers ≡2 mod3 from 2 to 2016 inclusive.Compute floor((2016 -2)/3) +1= floor(2014/3)+1=671 +1=672.Yes, so 672 terms.But hold on, n=2 is included, which is correct.Wait, but earlier, when I considered n=2, I thought it was a special case, but it seems it's part of the sequence.So, the answer should be 672.But wait, earlier, when I thought n≡1 mod3, I got 671, but that was incorrect because n=2 is actually ≡2 mod3 and is junk.So, the correct count is 672.Wait, but let me cross-verify:Compute the number of integers ≡2 mod3 from 1 to2016.It's floor((2016 -2)/3)+1= floor(2014/3)+1=671 +1=672.But since n must be ≥2, and the first term is 2, which is included, so yes, 672.Therefore, the number of junk positive integers less than or equal to2016 is672.But wait, hold on, earlier when I thought n=4 was junk, but it turned out not to be. So, perhaps my initial reasoning was wrong, but upon checking n=2,5,8,..., they are junk, and n=3,4,6,7,9, etc., are not.So, the correct answer is672.But wait, let me check n=2015:2015 mod3=2015-3*671=2015-2013=2. So, 2015≡2 mod3, which is included.And 2015 +3=2018>2016, so 2015 is the last term.Thus, the number of terms is672.Therefore, the answer is672.**Final Answer**boxed{672}"},{"question":"Find two integers ( A ) and ( B ) that are 1 unit apart on the number line and possess the following property: a root of the equation ( x^{3}+5x^{2}-3x+1=0 ) lies in the interval ( (A, B) ).","answer":"Okay, so I need to find two integers A and B that are 1 unit apart on the number line, and there's a root of the equation ( x^{3} + 5x^{2} - 3x + 1 = 0 ) lying between them. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for polynomials, the Intermediate Value Theorem can be useful. It states that if a function is continuous on an interval [a, b], and if f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, then there is at least one root between a and b. Since this is a cubic polynomial, it's continuous everywhere, so that should work.So, maybe I can evaluate the polynomial at different integer points and see where the sign changes. That should indicate a root in that interval. Let me write down the function:( f(x) = x^{3} + 5x^{2} - 3x + 1 )I need to compute f(x) at several integer values and check for sign changes.Let me start with x = -5:( f(-5) = (-5)^3 + 5(-5)^2 - 3(-5) + 1 = -125 + 125 + 15 + 1 = 16 )Okay, f(-5) is 16, which is positive.Next, x = -4:( f(-4) = (-4)^3 + 5(-4)^2 - 3(-4) + 1 = -64 + 80 + 12 + 1 = 29 )Still positive.x = -3:( f(-3) = (-3)^3 + 5(-3)^2 - 3(-3) + 1 = -27 + 45 + 9 + 1 = 28 )Positive again.x = -2:( f(-2) = (-2)^3 + 5(-2)^2 - 3(-2) + 1 = -8 + 20 + 6 + 1 = 19 )Still positive.x = -1:( f(-1) = (-1)^3 + 5(-1)^2 - 3(-1) + 1 = -1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 8 )Positive.x = 0:( f(0) = 0 + 0 - 0 + 1 = 1 )Positive.x = 1:( f(1) = 1 + 5 - 3 + 1 = 4 )Positive.x = 2:( f(2) = 8 + 20 - 6 + 1 = 23 )Positive.Hmm, all these are positive. Wait, maybe I need to check more negative numbers or perhaps positive numbers beyond 2? Let me try x = -6:( f(-6) = (-6)^3 + 5(-6)^2 - 3(-6) + 1 = -216 + 180 + 18 + 1 = (-216 + 180) + (18 + 1) = (-36) + 19 = -17 )Okay, f(-6) is -17, which is negative. So, f(-6) is negative, and f(-5) is positive. That means there's a root between -6 and -5 because the function changes sign from negative to positive.Wait, but the problem says A and B are integers 1 unit apart. So, the interval (-6, -5) is 1 unit apart, right? So, A = -6 and B = -5.But let me confirm if there are other intervals where the function changes sign. Maybe there's another root in a different interval.Wait, but the function is a cubic, so it can have up to three real roots. Let me check x = 3:( f(3) = 27 + 45 - 9 + 1 = 64 )Positive.x = 4:( f(4) = 64 + 80 - 12 + 1 = 133 )Positive.x = 5:( f(5) = 125 + 125 - 15 + 1 = 236 )Positive.So, as x increases beyond 0, the function remains positive. So, maybe all other roots are negative? Let me check between x = -1 and x = 0:f(-1) = 8, f(0) = 1. Both positive, so no sign change.Between x = -2 and x = -1: f(-2)=19, f(-1)=8. Both positive.Between x = -3 and x = -2: f(-3)=28, f(-2)=19. Both positive.Between x = -4 and x = -3: f(-4)=29, f(-3)=28. Both positive.Between x = -5 and x = -4: f(-5)=16, f(-4)=29. Both positive.Between x = -6 and x = -5: f(-6)=-17, f(-5)=16. Sign changes from negative to positive, so a root here.Is there another sign change? Let me check between x = -7 and x = -6:f(-7) = (-7)^3 + 5(-7)^2 - 3(-7) + 1 = -343 + 245 + 21 + 1 = (-343 + 245) + (21 + 1) = (-98) + 22 = -76So, f(-7) = -76, which is negative. f(-6) = -17, also negative. So, no sign change here.So, the only sign change is between x = -6 and x = -5. Therefore, the only integer interval 1 unit apart with a root is (-6, -5). So, A = -6 and B = -5.Wait, but the problem says \\"a root\\" lies in (A, B), so maybe there's another root in a different interval? Let me check if the function can have another root.Wait, the function is a cubic, so it can have up to three real roots. Let me try to see if there's another sign change.Wait, when x approaches negative infinity, the function behaves like x^3, which goes to negative infinity, and as x approaches positive infinity, it goes to positive infinity. So, since f(-6) is -17 and f(-5) is 16, that's one root. Then, as x increases from -5 onwards, the function remains positive, so maybe there's another root somewhere else?Wait, but all the other integer points I checked from x = -5 to x = 5 are positive. So, maybe there's only one real root between -6 and -5, and the other two roots are complex? Or maybe I missed something.Wait, let me try to compute f(-0.5):( f(-0.5) = (-0.5)^3 + 5(-0.5)^2 - 3(-0.5) + 1 = -0.125 + 1.25 + 1.5 + 1 = (-0.125 + 1.25) + (1.5 + 1) = 1.125 + 2.5 = 3.625 )Positive.f(-1.5):( f(-1.5) = (-1.5)^3 + 5(-1.5)^2 - 3(-1.5) + 1 = -3.375 + 11.25 + 4.5 + 1 = (-3.375 + 11.25) + (4.5 + 1) = 7.875 + 5.5 = 13.375 )Positive.f(-2.5):( f(-2.5) = (-2.5)^3 + 5(-2.5)^2 - 3(-2.5) + 1 = -15.625 + 31.25 + 7.5 + 1 = (-15.625 + 31.25) + (7.5 + 1) = 15.625 + 8.5 = 24.125 )Positive.Hmm, so between x = -6 and x = -5, the function goes from negative to positive, indicating a root. But beyond that, from x = -5 onwards, it's positive. So, maybe there's only one real root between -6 and -5, and the other two roots are complex.Wait, but let me check f(-3):f(-3) = 28, which is positive.Wait, perhaps I should check the derivative to see the behavior of the function.The derivative f'(x) = 3x^2 + 10x - 3.Setting f'(x) = 0:3x^2 + 10x - 3 = 0Using quadratic formula:x = [-10 ± sqrt(100 + 36)] / 6 = [-10 ± sqrt(136)] / 6 = [-10 ± 2*sqrt(34)] / 6 = [-5 ± sqrt(34)] / 3sqrt(34) is approximately 5.830, so:x ≈ (-5 + 5.830)/3 ≈ 0.830/3 ≈ 0.276x ≈ (-5 - 5.830)/3 ≈ -10.830/3 ≈ -3.610So, critical points at approximately x ≈ 0.276 and x ≈ -3.610.So, the function has a local maximum at x ≈ -3.610 and a local minimum at x ≈ 0.276.Let me compute f(-3.610):Approximately, f(-3.610) = (-3.610)^3 + 5*(-3.610)^2 - 3*(-3.610) + 1Calculating each term:(-3.610)^3 ≈ -47.055*(-3.610)^2 ≈ 5*(13.03) ≈ 65.15-3*(-3.610) ≈ 10.83So, adding up: -47.05 + 65.15 + 10.83 + 1 ≈ (-47.05 + 65.15) + (10.83 + 1) ≈ 18.1 + 11.83 ≈ 29.93So, f(-3.610) ≈ 29.93, which is positive.Similarly, f(0.276):(0.276)^3 + 5*(0.276)^2 - 3*(0.276) + 1 ≈ 0.021 + 5*(0.076) - 0.828 + 1 ≈ 0.021 + 0.38 - 0.828 + 1 ≈ (0.021 + 0.38) + (-0.828 + 1) ≈ 0.401 + 0.172 ≈ 0.573So, f(0.276) ≈ 0.573, which is positive.So, the function has a local maximum at x ≈ -3.610 with f(x) ≈ 29.93 and a local minimum at x ≈ 0.276 with f(x) ≈ 0.573. Both are positive. Therefore, the function only crosses the x-axis once, between x = -6 and x = -5, as that's the only interval where it changes from negative to positive.Therefore, the only integer interval 1 unit apart with a root is (-6, -5). So, A = -6 and B = -5.But wait, the problem says \\"a root\\" lies in (A, B), so maybe there's another interval? Let me double-check.Wait, I already checked all integer points from x = -7 to x = 5, and the only sign change is between x = -6 and x = -5. So, that must be the interval.Therefore, the integers A and B are -6 and -5, respectively.**Final Answer**The integers are boxed{-6} and boxed{-5}."},{"question":"Find the product of three numbers, the sum of which is equal to the sum of their squares, the sum of their cubes, and is equal to 1.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: find the product of three numbers where the sum of the numbers is equal to the sum of their squares, which is also equal to the sum of their cubes, and all of these are equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, let's translate the problem into mathematical equations. Let the three numbers be ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). The problem states that:1. The sum of the numbers is 1:   [ a + b + c = 1 ]2. The sum of their squares is also 1:   [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1 ]3. The sum of their cubes is 1 as well:   [ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 1 ]And we need to find the product ( abc ).Okay, so we have three equations here. Let me see how I can relate these to find ( abc ). I remember that there are some identities in algebra that relate sums, sums of squares, sums of cubes, and products. Maybe I can use those to find the product.First, let's recall the identity for the square of a sum:[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ac) ]We know ( a + b + c = 1 ) and ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1 ). Let's plug these into the identity:[ 1^2 = 1 + 2(ab + bc + ac) ][ 1 = 1 + 2(ab + bc + ac) ]Subtracting 1 from both sides:[ 0 = 2(ab + bc + ac) ][ ab + bc + ac = 0 ]Alright, so the sum of the pairwise products is zero. That's a useful piece of information.Next, let's think about the sum of cubes. There's an identity for the sum of cubes:[ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc ]We know ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 1 ), ( a + b + c = 1 ), and ( ab + bc + ac = 0 ). Let's substitute these into the identity:[ 1 = 1^3 - 3 times 1 times 0 + 3abc ][ 1 = 1 - 0 + 3abc ][ 1 = 1 + 3abc ]Subtracting 1 from both sides:[ 0 = 3abc ][ abc = 0 ]Wait, so the product ( abc ) is zero? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with the sum of the numbers:[ a + b + c = 1 ]Sum of squares:[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1 ]Which led to:[ ab + bc + ac = 0 ]Then, using the sum of cubes identity:[ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc ]Substituting the known values:[ 1 = 1 - 0 + 3abc ]So, indeed:[ 1 = 1 + 3abc ]Which simplifies to:[ 0 = 3abc ]Thus:[ abc = 0 ]Hmm, that seems correct. So, the product of the three numbers is zero. But just to be thorough, let me consider what this implies about the numbers ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ).If ( abc = 0 ), then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Let's say, without loss of generality, that ( c = 0 ). Then, our original equations become:1. ( a + b + 0 = 1 ) => ( a + b = 1 )2. ( a^2 + b^2 + 0 = 1 ) => ( a^2 + b^2 = 1 )3. ( a^3 + b^3 + 0 = 1 ) => ( a^3 + b^3 = 1 )So, now we have a system of equations with two variables, ( a ) and ( b ). Let's see if we can solve for ( a ) and ( b ).From the first equation, ( a + b = 1 ), we can express ( b = 1 - a ). Let's substitute this into the second equation:[ a^2 + (1 - a)^2 = 1 ]Expanding ( (1 - a)^2 ):[ a^2 + 1 - 2a + a^2 = 1 ]Combine like terms:[ 2a^2 - 2a + 1 = 1 ]Subtract 1 from both sides:[ 2a^2 - 2a = 0 ]Factor out 2a:[ 2a(a - 1) = 0 ]So, ( a = 0 ) or ( a = 1 ).If ( a = 0 ), then ( b = 1 - 0 = 1 ).If ( a = 1 ), then ( b = 1 - 1 = 0 ).So, the solutions are ( (a, b, c) = (0, 1, 0) ) or ( (1, 0, 0) ). Wait, but in both cases, two of the numbers are zero and one is one. Let me check if these satisfy the third equation, ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 1 ).For ( (0, 1, 0) ):[ 0^3 + 1^3 + 0^3 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 ]Which works.For ( (1, 0, 0) ):[ 1^3 + 0^3 + 0^3 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 ]Also works.So, both solutions satisfy all three equations. Therefore, the product ( abc ) is indeed zero because at least one of the numbers is zero in each case.Just to make sure there are no other solutions, let's consider if all three numbers are non-zero. If ( abc = 0 ), then at least one is zero, so there are no solutions where all three numbers are non-zero. Therefore, the only solutions are those where one number is 1 and the other two are 0, leading to the product being zero.So, after going through the equations step by step and verifying the solutions, I'm confident that the product ( abc ) is zero.**Final Answer**The product of the three numbers is boxed{0}."},{"question":"If the graph of a linear function y=2x+b is shifted down by 2 units and passes through the point left(-1,0right), then the value of b is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a linear function. Let me read it again: \\"If the graph of a linear function y = 2x + b is shifted down by 2 units and passes through the point (-1, 0), then the value of b is ____.\\" Hmm, I need to find the value of b. Alright, let's break this down step by step.First, I remember that shifting a graph down by a certain number of units affects the y-intercept of the function. The original function is y = 2x + b. If we shift it down by 2 units, that should subtract 2 from the y-intercept. So, the new function after the shift would be y = 2x + (b - 2). Is that right? Let me think. Yes, because shifting down by 2 is like subtracting 2 from the entire function, so it becomes y = 2x + b - 2, which is the same as y = 2x + (b - 2). Okay, that makes sense.Now, the problem says that this shifted graph passes through the point (-1, 0). So, if I plug x = -1 into the shifted function, y should equal 0. Let me write that out:0 = 2*(-1) + (b - 2)Let me compute 2*(-1). That's -2. So, substituting that in:0 = -2 + (b - 2)Now, let me simplify the right side. Combine the constants first: -2 - 2 is -4. So, this becomes:0 = -4 + bHmm, so if I solve for b, I can add 4 to both sides:0 + 4 = bWhich means:4 = bSo, b is 4. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Original function: y = 2x + b2. Shifted down by 2: y = 2x + (b - 2)3. Passes through (-1, 0): Plug x = -1, y = 0 into the shifted function.4. 0 = 2*(-1) + (b - 2) => 0 = -2 + b - 2 => 0 = b - 45. So, b = 4Yes, that seems correct. Let me just visualize it to make sure. The original function has a slope of 2 and y-intercept b. After shifting down by 2, the y-intercept becomes b - 2. The point (-1, 0) is on this shifted graph, so when x is -1, y is 0. Plugging in, we get 0 = 2*(-1) + (b - 2). That simplifies to 0 = -2 + b - 2, which is 0 = b - 4, so b is 4. Yep, that all checks out.Wait, just to be thorough, let me plug b = 4 back into the original function and see if shifting it down by 2 gives a function that goes through (-1, 0). So, original function: y = 2x + 4. Shifted down by 2: y = 2x + 4 - 2 = 2x + 2. Now, plugging in x = -1: y = 2*(-1) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. Perfect, that's exactly the point given. So, yes, b must be 4.I think I've got it. The key was understanding how shifting the graph affects the equation and then using the given point to solve for b. It's important to remember that shifting down subtracts from the y-intercept. If I had shifted up, it would have added instead. But in this case, it was a downward shift, so subtraction was the right operation.Another way to think about it is that shifting the graph down by 2 units is equivalent to subtracting 2 from the entire function. So, starting with y = 2x + b, subtracting 2 from both sides gives y = 2x + b - 2. Then, using the point (-1, 0) to find b. That's exactly what I did earlier, so that reinforces that my method was correct.I guess another common mistake could be confusing the direction of the shift. For example, if someone thought shifting down meant adding 2 instead of subtracting, they would get a different answer. But since shifting down reduces the y-values, it makes sense that we subtract from the function. So, that's a good thing to remember.Also, it's always a good idea to plug the found value back into the original equation to verify. I did that, and it worked out, so I feel confident that b is indeed 4.So, in summary, the steps are:1. Start with the original function.2. Apply the shift (subtract 2 for a downward shift).3. Substitute the given point into the shifted function.4. Solve for b.5. Verify by plugging back into the shifted function.Everything seems to align, so I think I'm solid on this.**Final Answer**The value of ( b ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"If the quadratic equation 2x^{2}-8x+a=0 is factored into 2left(x-2right)^{2}=4, then the value of a is ______.","answer":"To determine the value of ( a ) in the quadratic equation ( 2x^{2} - 8x + a = 0 ) when it is factored into ( 2(x - 2)^{2} = 4 ), follow these steps:1. **Expand the Factored Form:**   [   2(x - 2)^{2} = 2(x^{2} - 4x + 4) = 2x^{2} - 8x + 8   ]2. **Set the Equations Equal:**   [   2x^{2} - 8x + a = 2x^{2} - 8x + 8   ]3. **Compare Constants:**   [   a = 8   ]"},{"question":"Last summer 30% of the birds living on Town Lake were geese, 25% were swans, 10% were herons, and 35% were ducks.

Let me list them again to make sure I have them all:1. (0 < x^2 < 1)2. (x^2 > 1)3. (-1 < x < 0)4. (0 < x < 1)5. (0 < x - x^2 < 1)Hmm, I need to see how many of these can be true at the same time for some x. Let me go through each statement and see how they relate to each other.First, statement 1: (0 < x^2 < 1). That means x is between -1 and 1, but not including 0, because x squared is greater than 0. So x is in (-1, 0) or (0, 1).Statement 2: (x^2 > 1). This would mean that x is either less than -1 or greater than 1. So x is in (-∞, -1) or (1, ∞).Statements 3 and 4: These are intervals. Statement 3 is (-1 < x < 0), so x is negative but greater than -1. Statement 4 is (0 < x < 1), so x is positive but less than 1.Statement 5: (0 < x - x^2 < 1). Let me think about this one. It's a bit more complex. Let me try to analyze it.First, let's consider the expression (x - x^2). Maybe I can factor it or rewrite it to understand its behavior. (x - x^2 = x(1 - x)). So, it's the product of x and (1 - x). Let me consider different intervals for x:1. If x is positive:   - If x is between 0 and 1, then both x and (1 - x) are positive, so their product is positive.   - If x is greater than 1, then x is positive, but (1 - x) is negative, so the product is negative.   2. If x is negative:   - Then x is negative, and (1 - x) is positive (since subtracting a negative makes it larger). So their product is negative.So, (x - x^2) is positive only when x is between 0 and 1. That's interesting. So statement 5 is only true when x is in (0,1). Now, let's see the inequalities:First, (0 < x - x^2). As I just concluded, this is true when x is in (0,1). Next, (x - x^2 < 1). Let's see when this is true. Let's solve the inequality:(x - x^2 < 1)Let me rearrange it:( -x^2 + x - 1 < 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality):(x^2 - x + 1 > 0)Now, let's analyze the quadratic (x^2 - x + 1). The discriminant is (b^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3). Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis and is always positive because the coefficient of (x^2) is positive. So, (x^2 - x + 1 > 0) is always true for all real x. Therefore, (x - x^2 < 1) is always true.So, statement 5 simplifies to (0 < x - x^2), which is only true when x is in (0,1). So statement 5 is equivalent to statement 4, but let me check that.Wait, statement 4 is (0 < x < 1), and statement 5 is (0 < x - x^2 < 1), which we just saw is equivalent to (0 < x < 1). So, if x is in (0,1), both statements 4 and 5 are true. If x is outside of (0,1), statement 5 is false.So, statement 5 is redundant with statement 4 in the sense that if statement 4 is true, statement 5 is also true, and if statement 5 is true, statement 4 must be true. So, they are equivalent.Wait, but let me verify that. Suppose x is in (0,1). Then statement 4 is true, and statement 5 is also true. If x is not in (0,1), statement 4 is false, and statement 5 is false. So yes, they are equivalent. So, if I have statement 4 true, statement 5 is automatically true, and vice versa.So, that means statements 4 and 5 are linked. If one is true, the other is true, and if one is false, the other is false. So, they can't be independently true or false. So, in terms of maximizing the number of true statements, if I can have both 4 and 5 true, that's two statements, but they are connected.Now, let's look at the other statements.Statement 1: (0 < x^2 < 1). As I thought earlier, that's x in (-1, 0) or (0,1). So, x is between -1 and 1, excluding 0.Statement 2: (x^2 > 1). So, x is less than -1 or greater than 1.So, statements 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive. If statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false, and vice versa.Similarly, statements 3 and 4 are also mutually exclusive because statement 3 is x in (-1,0) and statement 4 is x in (0,1). So, they can't both be true at the same time.So, let me try to see what combinations are possible.Case 1: x is in (-1, 0). Then, statement 1 is true (since x squared is between 0 and 1), statement 3 is true (since x is between -1 and 0), statement 2 is false, statement 4 is false, and statement 5 is false (since x is negative, so x - x^2 is negative, so statement 5 is false). So, in this case, statements 1 and 3 are true, so that's two statements.Case 2: x is in (0,1). Then, statement 1 is true (x squared is between 0 and 1), statement 4 is true (x is between 0 and 1), statement 5 is true (as we saw earlier), statement 2 is false, and statement 3 is false. So, in this case, statements 1, 4, and 5 are true. That's three statements.Case 3: x is less than or equal to -1 or greater than or equal to 1. Then, statement 2 is true, statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are false. So, only statement 2 is true, which is just one statement.So, from these cases, the maximum number of statements that can be true is three, which occurs when x is in (0,1). In that interval, statements 1, 4, and 5 are all true.Wait, let me double-check. If x is in (0,1), then:- Statement 1: (0 < x^2 < 1) is true because x is between 0 and 1, so x squared is also between 0 and 1.- Statement 4: (0 < x < 1) is true by definition.- Statement 5: (0 < x - x^2 < 1) is true because, as we saw earlier, when x is in (0,1), (x - x^2) is positive and less than 1.So, yes, all three are true. And statements 2 and 3 are false because x is neither less than or equal to -1 nor greater than or equal to 1, and x is positive, so statement 3 is false.Is there any x where more than three statements can be true? Let's see.Suppose x is 0.5. Then:- Statement 1: (0 < (0.5)^2 = 0.25 < 1) → True.- Statement 2: (0.25 > 1) → False.- Statement 3: (-1 < 0.5 < 0) → False.- Statement 4: (0 < 0.5 < 1) → True.- Statement 5: (0 < 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 < 1) → True.So, three statements are true.What if x is 0. Let's check:- Statement 1: (0 < 0^2 = 0 < 1) → False.- Statement 2: (0 > 1) → False.- Statement 3: (-1 < 0 < 0) → False (since 0 is not less than 0).- Statement 4: (0 < 0 < 1) → False.- Statement 5: (0 < 0 - 0 = 0 < 1) → False.So, all statements are false. Not helpful.What about x = 1?- Statement 1: (0 < 1^2 = 1 < 1) → False (since 1 is not less than 1).- Statement 2: (1 > 1) → False.- Statement 3: (-1 < 1 < 0) → False.- Statement 4: (0 < 1 < 1) → False.- Statement 5: (0 < 1 - 1 = 0 < 1) → False.Same with x = -1:- Statement 1: (0 < (-1)^2 = 1 < 1) → False.- Statement 2: (1 > 1) → False.- Statement 3: (-1 < -1 < 0) → False.- Statement 4: (0 < -1 < 1) → False.- Statement 5: (0 < -1 - 1 = -2 < 1) → False.So, x = 1 or x = -1, all statements are false.What about x = 0. Let's see, as before, all statements are false.Wait, maybe if I pick x very close to 0, say x = 0.1.- Statement 1: (0 < 0.01 < 1) → True.- Statement 4: (0 < 0.1 < 1) → True.- Statement 5: (0 < 0.1 - 0.01 = 0.09 < 1) → True.So, again, three statements.What about x = 0.9.- Statement 1: (0 < 0.81 < 1) → True.- Statement 4: (0 < 0.9 < 1) → True.- Statement 5: (0 < 0.9 - 0.81 = 0.09 < 1) → True.Same result.Wait, what if I pick x = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707.- Statement 1: (0 < (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5 < 1) → True.- Statement 4: (0 < sqrt(2)/2 < 1) → True.- Statement 5: (0 < sqrt(2)/2 - 0.5 ≈ 0.707 - 0.5 = 0.207 < 1) → True.Still three statements.Is there a way to get more than three statements true?Let me think about statement 5 again. It's equivalent to statement 4, so if I have statement 4 true, statement 5 is automatically true. So, if I have statement 4 true, I can get two statements at once.But statements 1, 4, and 5 are all true when x is in (0,1). So, that's three statements.Is there a way to get statement 1, 4, 5, and another statement true? Let's see.Statement 3 is (-1 < x < 0), which is incompatible with statement 4, which is (0 < x < 1). So, if statement 4 is true, statement 3 is false.Similarly, statement 2 is (x^2 > 1), which is incompatible with statement 1, which is (0 < x^2 < 1). So, if statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false.Therefore, in the interval (0,1), statements 1, 4, and 5 are true, and statements 2 and 3 are false. So, three statements.Is there a way to have statement 1, 4, 5, and maybe another statement? Let's see.Wait, statement 1 is (0 < x^2 < 1), which is true in (-1,0) and (0,1). So, if x is in (0,1), statement 1 is true, and statements 4 and 5 are also true. So, that's three.If x is in (-1,0), statement 1 is true, statement 3 is true, and statements 4 and 5 are false. So, that's two.So, the maximum is three.Wait, but let me think again. Is there any overlap where more than three statements can be true?Suppose x is in (0,1). Then, statements 1, 4, and 5 are true. Is there any other statement that can be true?Statement 2 is (x^2 > 1), which is false because x is less than 1, so x squared is less than 1.Statement 3 is (-1 < x < 0), which is false because x is positive.So, no, only three statements.Wait, what if x is exactly 1? Then, statement 1 is (0 < 1 < 1), which is false because 1 is not less than 1. Similarly, statement 4 is (0 < 1 < 1), which is false. So, no.What about x = 0.5, as before. Three statements.Is there a value of x where four statements can be true?Let me see. Suppose x is in (0,1). Then, statements 1, 4, and 5 are true. That's three. What about statement 2 or 3? If x is in (0,1), statement 2 is false because x squared is less than 1, and statement 3 is false because x is positive. So, no.If x is in (-1,0), statements 1 and 3 are true, but statements 2, 4, and 5 are false. So, two statements.If x is outside of (-1,1), statement 2 is true, others are false. So, one statement.So, it seems that the maximum number of statements that can be true is three.Wait, but let me check if x can be such that statement 1 is true, and maybe another statement. But as we saw, statement 1 is true in (-1,0) and (0,1). In (0,1), statements 4 and 5 are also true, so that's three. In (-1,0), only statements 1 and 3 are true, which is two.So, three is the maximum.Wait, but let me think again about statement 5. It's (0 < x - x^2 < 1). We saw that when x is in (0,1), this is true. But is there a case where x is in (0,1) and also satisfies another statement?Wait, if x is in (0,1), statement 1 is true, statement 4 is true, statement 5 is true. So, that's three. There's no other statement that can be true because statement 2 and 3 are false.Alternatively, if x is in (-1,0), statement 1 and 3 are true, but statements 4 and 5 are false. So, two.So, yeah, three is the maximum.Wait, but let me think about x = 0.5 again. So, x = 0.5:- Statement 1: (0 < 0.25 < 1) → True.- Statement 2: (0.25 > 1) → False.- Statement 3: (-1 < 0.5 < 0) → False.- Statement 4: (0 < 0.5 < 1) → True.- Statement 5: (0 < 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 < 1) → True.So, three statements.Is there any x where four statements are true? Let me think.Suppose x is in (0,1). Then, statements 1, 4, 5 are true. What about statement 2? Statement 2 is (x^2 > 1), which is false because x is less than 1, so x squared is less than 1. Statement 3 is (-1 < x < 0), which is false because x is positive. So, no.What about x in (-1,0). Then, statements 1 and 3 are true. What about statement 4? Statement 4 is (0 < x < 1), which is false because x is negative. Statement 5 is (0 < x - x^2 < 1). Since x is negative, (x - x^2) is negative because x is negative and (x^2) is positive, so (x - x^2) is negative. So, statement 5 is false. So, only two statements.What about x = 1 or x = -1? As before, all statements are false.What about x = 2? Then, statement 2 is true, others are false.So, no, it seems that three is the maximum.Wait, but let me think about statement 5 again. Is it possible that for some x in (0,1), statement 5 is false? Because statement 5 is (0 < x - x^2 < 1). Since we saw that when x is in (0,1), (x - x^2) is positive, and since (x - x^2 = x(1 - x)), which is less than 1 because both x and (1 - x) are less than 1, their product is less than 1. So, statement 5 is always true when x is in (0,1). So, if x is in (0,1), statements 1, 4, and 5 are always true.Therefore, the maximum number of statements that can be true is three.Wait, but let me check if x is in (0,1), can statement 2 be true? No, because statement 2 is (x^2 > 1), which would require x > 1 or x < -1, which is not the case here. So, statement 2 is false.Similarly, statement 3 is false because x is positive.So, yeah, three statements.Therefore, the answer is 3.**Final Answer**The maximum number of statements that can be true is boxed{3}."},{"question":"The sum of 25 consecutive even integers is 10,000.

How many students have two of these talents? textbf{(A)} 16qquadtextbf{(B)} 25qquadtextbf{(C)} 36qquadtextbf{(D)} 49qquadtextbf{(E)} 64","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about 100 students in a summer camp, and each student can sing, dance, or act. Some can do more than one talent, but none can do all three. The problem gives me some numbers: 42 students cannot sing, 65 cannot dance, and 29 cannot act. I need to find how many students have two talents. The answer choices are A through E, with numbers 16, 25, 36, 49, and 64. First, let me parse the problem. There are 100 students total. Each student can do at least one talent, but not all three. So, possible categories are: only sing, only dance, only act, sing and dance, sing and act, dance and act. No one is in all three. The problem gives me the number of students who cannot do each talent. So, 42 cannot sing, which means the number of students who can sing is 100 - 42 = 58. Similarly, 65 cannot dance, so the number who can dance is 100 - 65 = 35. And 29 cannot act, so the number who can act is 100 - 29 = 71.So, S (singers) = 58, D (dancers) = 35, A (actors) = 71.Now, since some students can do more than one talent, but none can do all three, I can model this with a Venn diagram. There are three circles: Sing, Dance, Act. The overlaps are between two circles, but the center where all three overlap is zero.Let me denote:- a = number of students who can only sing,- b = number who can only dance,- c = number who can only act,- d = number who can sing and dance,- e = number who can sing and act,- f = number who can dance and act.Since no one can do all three, the total number of students is a + b + c + d + e + f = 100.Also, the number of students who can sing is a + d + e = 58,the number who can dance is b + d + f = 35,and the number who can act is c + e + f = 71.So, I have three equations:1. a + d + e = 58,2. b + d + f = 35,3. c + e + f = 71.And the total is a + b + c + d + e + f = 100.I need to find the number of students who have two talents, which is d + e + f.So, if I can find d + e + f, that's the answer.Let me see. If I add the three equations:(a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) = 58 + 35 + 71.Left side: a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f.Right side: 58 + 35 is 93, plus 71 is 164.So, a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f = 164.But from the total, a + b + c + d + e + f = 100.So, subtract the total from the sum of the three equations:(a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f) - (a + b + c + d + e + f) = 164 - 100.This simplifies to d + e + f = 64.Wait, so d + e + f = 64? But that's the number of students with two talents. But 64 is one of the options, E. But wait, let me check if I did that correctly.Wait, 58 + 35 + 71 is 164. Then, the sum of the three equations is 164, which is equal to a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f. The total number of students is a + b + c + d + e + f = 100. So, subtracting, (a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f) - (a + b + c + d + e + f) = d + e + f = 164 - 100 = 64.So, d + e + f = 64. So, 64 students have two talents. So, answer E.But wait, the answer choices are A:16, B:25, C:36, D:49, E:64. So, E is 64. But wait, the problem says \\"Some students have more than one talent, but no student has all three talents.\\" So, 64 students have two talents, and the rest have only one talent. Let me check if that's possible.So, total students with two talents: 64. Then, students with only one talent: 100 - 64 = 36.But let's check the numbers. The number of singers is 58, which is a + d + e. So, a + d + e = 58. Similarly, dancers: b + d + f = 35, actors: c + e + f = 71.If d + e + f = 64, then a + b + c = 100 - 64 = 36.From the singer equation: a = 58 - d - e.From the dancer equation: b = 35 - d - f.From the actor equation: c = 71 - e - f.So, a + b + c = (58 - d - e) + (35 - d - f) + (71 - e - f) = 58 + 35 + 71 - 2d - 2e - 2f.Which is 164 - 2(d + e + f). Since d + e + f = 64, this is 164 - 128 = 36. Which matches the total a + b + c = 36. So, that seems consistent.Therefore, the number of students with two talents is 64, which is E.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"Some students have more than one talent, but no student has all three talents.\\" So, that's correct, we have 64 students with two talents, and 36 with only one. That seems okay.But wait, let me check if the numbers make sense. For example, the number of singers is 58. If 64 students have two talents, and singers include those who can sing and dance, sing and act, and only sing. So, the number of singers is a + d + e = 58. Similarly, dancers are 35, which is b + d + f = 35.Wait, but if d + e + f = 64, and a + b + c = 36, then let's see if the numbers add up.Wait, a + b + c = 36, and d + e + f = 64, so total is 100, which is correct.But let me see if the individual counts make sense. For example, singers: 58 = a + d + e. Since a = 36 - b - c, but maybe that's getting too detailed.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of the principle of inclusion-exclusion.Wait, the standard inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets is:|S ∪ D ∪ A| = |S| + |D| + |A| - |S ∩ D| - |S ∩ A| - |D ∩ A| + |S ∩ D ∩ A|.But in this case, since no one is in all three, |S ∩ D ∩ A| = 0.And since all students can do at least one talent, |S ∪ D ∪ A| = 100.So, 100 = |S| + |D| + |A| - |S ∩ D| - |S ∩ A| - |D ∩ A|.So, 100 = 58 + 35 + 71 - (|S ∩ D| + |S ∩ A| + |D ∩ A|).Calculating 58 + 35 + 71: 58 + 35 is 93, plus 71 is 164.So, 100 = 164 - (|S ∩ D| + |S ∩ A| + |D ∩ A|).Therefore, |S ∩ D| + |S ∩ A| + |D ∩ A| = 164 - 100 = 64.But |S ∩ D|, |S ∩ A|, |D ∩ A| are the numbers of students who can do two talents, which is exactly d + e + f. So, that's 64. Therefore, the number of students with two talents is 64, which is E.But wait, the answer choices include 64 as E, but the problem is from an Olympiad, and sometimes the answer might be different. But according to the calculations, it's 64.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. It says \\"42 students cannot sing,\\" which means 100 - 42 = 58 can sing. Similarly, 65 cannot dance, so 35 can dance. 29 cannot act, so 71 can act. So, that's correct.But in inclusion-exclusion, the formula is |S ∪ D ∪ A| = |S| + |D| + |A| - |S ∩ D| - |S ∩ A| - |D ∩ A| + |S ∩ D ∩ A|. Since all students are in at least one set, |S ∪ D ∪ A| = 100. And since |S ∩ D ∩ A| = 0, we have 100 = 58 + 35 + 71 - (|S ∩ D| + |S ∩ A| + |D ∩ A|). So, 100 = 164 - (sum of pairwise intersections). Therefore, sum of pairwise intersections is 64. Since each pairwise intersection is the number of students with exactly two talents, because no one is in all three, so |S ∩ D| is exactly d, |S ∩ A| is exactly e, |D ∩ A| is exactly f. So, d + e + f = 64. So, that's correct.Therefore, the answer is E, 64. But wait, the answer choices are A:16, B:25, C:36, D:49, E:64. So, E is 64. So, I think that's correct.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. It says \\"Some students have more than one talent, but no student has all three talents.\\" So, that's correct, so the overlaps are exactly two talents, no three. So, the inclusion-exclusion applies as above.Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of students with exactly two talents, which is d + e + f, which is 64. So, that's E.Wait, but in the initial breakdown, I thought of a, b, c as only one talent, and d, e, f as exactly two. So, yes, d + e + f is exactly two talents, which is 64.Wait, but let me check if 64 is too high. Because the number of students who can dance is only 35, so the number of students who can dance and something else can't be more than 35. Similarly, the number of students who can sing is 58, so the overlaps can't exceed that.Wait, let's see. d + e + f = 64. But d is part of both singers and dancers, e is part of singers and actors, f is part of dancers and actors.But the number of dancers is 35, which is b + d + f. So, d + f <= 35, because b is non-negative. Similarly, the number of singers is 58, so d + e <= 58. The number of actors is 71, so e + f <= 71.So, d + f <= 35, d + e <= 58, e + f <= 71.But d + e + f = 64.So, let's see, if d + f <= 35, then e >= 64 - 35 = 29.Similarly, e + f <= 71, so d >= 64 - 71 = negative, which is fine, since d >=0.Similarly, d + e <=58, so f >=64 -58=6.So, e >=29, f >=6, d >=0.But let's see if these constraints are possible.So, e >=29, f >=6, d >=0.But let's see, if e is 29, then from the singer equation, a + d + e =58, so a + d =58 -29=29.Similarly, from the dancer equation, b + d + f =35. If f is 6, then b + d =35 -6=29.From the actor equation, c + e + f =71. If e=29 and f=6, then c=71 -29 -6=36.So, a + d =29, b + d=29, c=36.From the total, a + b + c + d + e + f=100.So, a + b + c + d + e + f = (a + d) + (b + d) + c + e + f - d.Wait, no, better to write as a + b + c + d + e + f = (a + d + e) + (b + d + f) + (c + e + f) - (d + e + f) - (a + b + c). Wait, maybe it's getting too convoluted.Alternatively, since a + d =29, b + d=29, c=36, e=29, f=6.So, a =29 - d, b=29 - d, c=36, e=29, f=6.Then, a + b + c + d + e + f = (29 - d) + (29 - d) + 36 + d +29 +6.Simplify: 29 +29 +36 +29 +6 -d -d +d.Which is 29+29=58, 58+36=94, 94+29=123, 123+6=129. Then, -d -d +d= -d.So, total is 129 - d.But total should be 100, so 129 - d =100 => d=29.So, d=29.Then, a=29 - d=0, b=29 - d=0, c=36, e=29, f=6.So, a=0, b=0, c=36, d=29, e=29, f=6.So, let's check the numbers:Singers: a + d + e =0 +29 +29=58, correct.Dancers: b + d + f=0 +29 +6=35, correct.Actors: c + e + f=36 +29 +6=71, correct.Total students:0 +0 +36 +29 +29 +6=100, correct.So, that works. So, even though e=29, which is quite high, but it's possible because the number of actors is 71, which is high.So, in this case, the number of students with two talents is d + e + f=29 +29 +6=64. So, that's correct.Therefore, the answer is E, 64.But wait, the answer choices are A:16, B:25, C:36, D:49, E:64. So, 64 is an option, so that's the answer.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"Some students have more than one talent, but no student has all three talents.\\" So, that's correct, we have 64 students with two talents, and 36 with only one. So, that seems okay.Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me think again.Wait, the inclusion-exclusion formula is |S ∪ D ∪ A| = |S| + |D| + |A| - |S ∩ D| - |S ∩ A| - |D ∩ A| + |S ∩ D ∩ A|. Since |S ∪ D ∪ A|=100, and |S ∩ D ∩ A|=0, so 100=58+35+71 - (|S ∩ D| + |S ∩ A| + |D ∩ A|). So, 100=164 - (sum of pairwise intersections). So, sum of pairwise intersections=64. Since each pairwise intersection is the number of students with exactly two talents, because no one is in all three, so that's d + e + f=64. So, that's correct.Therefore, the answer is E, 64.But wait, the answer choices are A:16, B:25, C:36, D:49, E:64. So, 64 is an option, so that's the answer.Wait, but I just realized, in the initial breakdown, I considered a, b, c as only one talent, and d, e, f as exactly two. So, d + e + f is exactly two talents, which is 64. So, that's correct.Wait, but let me think about the numbers again. If 64 students have two talents, that's more than half the camp. But given that 71 can act, which is a large number, and 58 can sing, which is also a large number, it's possible that a lot of students are in two talents.But let me check if the numbers make sense. For example, the number of students who can dance is 35, which is low. So, the number of students who can dance and something else can't be more than 35. But in our earlier breakdown, d + f=29 +6=35, which is exactly the number of dancers. So, that's correct.Similarly, the number of students who can sing is 58, which is a + d + e=0 +29 +29=58, correct.And the number of actors is 71, which is c + e + f=36 +29 +6=71, correct.So, all the numbers check out.Therefore, the answer is E, 64.Wait, but hold on, the problem says \\"Some students have more than one talent, but no student has all three talents.\\" So, that's correct, because we have students with two talents, but none with three.So, yeah, 64 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"How many ways can you mark 8 squares of an 8 times 8 chessboard so that no two marked squares are in the same row or column, and none of the four corner squares is marked? (Rotations and reflections are considered different.)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many ways I can mark 8 squares on an 8x8 chessboard. The conditions are that no two marked squares are in the same row or column, and none of the four corner squares can be marked. Also, rotations and reflections are considered different, so each arrangement is unique even if it's a rotation or reflection of another.Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, the chessboard is 8x8, so it has 8 rows and 8 columns. Marking 8 squares with no two in the same row or column sounds a lot like placing 8 non-attacking rooks on a chessboard. In chess, a rook attacks any piece in the same row or column, so placing 8 rooks such that none attack each other means one rook per row and column. The number of ways to do this is 8 factorial, which is 8! = 40320. That's the total number of ways without any restrictions.But wait, there's an added condition: none of the four corner squares can be marked. The corner squares are the four at the intersections of the first and last rows and columns. So, specifically, the squares (1,1), (1,8), (8,1), and (8,8) cannot be marked. So, I need to subtract the number of arrangements where any of these four squares are marked.This seems like a problem where I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works. If I have multiple conditions (in this case, four forbidden squares), the inclusion-exclusion principle helps account for overlaps where multiple conditions are violated.So, let's denote the forbidden squares as A, B, C, D, where A is (1,1), B is (1,8), C is (8,1), and D is (8,8). I need to calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions (which is 8!) and then subtract the arrangements where at least one forbidden square is marked, add back in the arrangements where two forbidden squares are marked (since they were subtracted twice), subtract the arrangements where three forbidden squares are marked, and so on.Mathematically, this can be written as:Total = 8! - (number of arrangements with A + number with B + number with C + number with D) + (number with A and B + number with A and C + ... ) - (number with A, B, C + ... ) + ... + (-1)^k (number with all k forbidden squares)But since there are four forbidden squares, the formula will go up to k=4.Let me compute each term step by step.First, the total number without restrictions: 8! = 40320.Next, the number of arrangements where at least one forbidden square is marked. Let's compute the number of arrangements where square A is marked. If A is marked, that means we've fixed the rook in row 1, column 1. Then, we have to place the remaining 7 rooks in the remaining 7 rows and 7 columns, but avoiding column 1 and row 1. So, that's 7! arrangements.Similarly, the number of arrangements where B is marked is also 7!, because B is in row 1, column 8. So, fixing a rook there, we have 7! ways to place the rest.Same logic applies to C and D: each forbidden square, when marked, reduces the problem to 7! arrangements.So, the first term to subtract is 4 * 7!.Calculating that: 4 * 5040 = 20160.So, now, subtracting that from the total: 40320 - 20160 = 20160.But wait, inclusion-exclusion isn't done yet. We have to add back the cases where two forbidden squares are marked because we subtracted them twice. So, now, we need to compute the number of arrangements where two forbidden squares are marked.How many ways are there to mark two forbidden squares? Since there are four forbidden squares, the number of pairs is C(4,2) = 6.Each pair can be either in the same row, same column, or neither. Wait, in our case, the forbidden squares are A(1,1), B(1,8), C(8,1), D(8,8). So, pairs can be:- A and B: same row (row 1)- A and C: same column (column 1)- A and D: different row and column- B and C: different row and column- B and D: same column (column 8)- C and D: same row (row 8)So, each pair can be either in the same row, same column, or neither. The number of arrangements where two forbidden squares are marked depends on whether they share a row or column.If two forbidden squares are in the same row or same column, then placing rooks on both would violate the non-attacking condition. Wait, hold on. If two forbidden squares are in the same row or column, can we actually place rooks on both? Because in the original problem, we need to place 8 rooks with none attacking each other, so two rooks cannot be in the same row or column. Therefore, if two forbidden squares are in the same row or same column, it's impossible to mark both. So, the number of arrangements where both are marked is zero.But if two forbidden squares are in different rows and different columns, then it's possible to mark both, and the rest can be arranged accordingly.So, let's see:Looking at the pairs:1. A and B: same row (row 1). Impossible to mark both. So, arrangements: 02. A and C: same column (column 1). Impossible to mark both. Arrangements: 03. A and D: different rows and columns. So, possible. How many arrangements? If we fix rooks at A(1,1) and D(8,8), then we have to place the remaining 6 rooks in the remaining 6 rows and 6 columns, avoiding columns 1 and 8, and rows 1 and 8. So, that's 6! arrangements.4. B and C: different rows and columns. Similarly, fix rooks at B(1,8) and C(8,1). Then, remaining 6 rooks can be placed in 6! ways.5. B and D: same column (column 8). Impossible to mark both. Arrangements: 06. C and D: same row (row 8). Impossible to mark both. Arrangements: 0So, out of the 6 pairs, only two pairs (A and D, B and C) can have both forbidden squares marked, each contributing 6! arrangements.Therefore, the number of arrangements where two forbidden squares are marked is 2 * 6!.Calculating that: 2 * 720 = 1440.So, adding this back to our total: 20160 + 1440 = 21600.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So, after subtracting the single forbidden squares, we added back the cases where two forbidden squares were marked. But only two of the six pairs were possible. So, yes, 2 * 6!.Proceeding to the next term in inclusion-exclusion: subtracting the cases where three forbidden squares are marked.How many ways can three forbidden squares be marked? Let's see. The number of triplets is C(4,3) = 4.Each triplet consists of three forbidden squares. Let's list them:1. A, B, C2. A, B, D3. A, C, D4. B, C, DNow, for each triplet, we need to determine if it's possible to mark all three without violating the non-attacking condition.Looking at triplet 1: A(1,1), B(1,8), C(8,1). A and B are in the same row, so marking both is impossible. Therefore, triplet 1 cannot be marked.Triplet 2: A(1,1), B(1,8), D(8,8). A and B are in the same row, so impossible.Triplet 3: A(1,1), C(8,1), D(8,8). A and C are in the same column, so impossible.Triplet 4: B(1,8), C(8,1), D(8,8). B and D are in the same column, so impossible.So, all four triplets involve at least two forbidden squares in the same row or column, making it impossible to mark all three. Therefore, the number of arrangements where three forbidden squares are marked is 0.So, we don't need to subtract anything here.Moving on to the last term: arrangements where all four forbidden squares are marked. Obviously, this is impossible because A and B are in the same row, A and C are in the same column, etc. So, marking all four is impossible. Therefore, the number of such arrangements is 0.Putting it all together, the inclusion-exclusion formula gives:Total arrangements = 8! - (4 * 7!) + (2 * 6!) - 0 + 0Calculating that:8! = 403204 * 7! = 4 * 5040 = 201602 * 6! = 2 * 720 = 1440So, substituting:Total = 40320 - 20160 + 1440 = 40320 - 20160 is 20160, plus 1440 is 21600.Wait, so the total number of valid arrangements is 21,600.But hold on, let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes inclusion-exclusion can be tricky.First, the total number of ways without restrictions is 8! = 40320.Then, subtract the number of arrangements where any of the four forbidden squares are marked. Each forbidden square, when marked, reduces the problem to 7!, so 4 * 7! = 20160. So, 40320 - 20160 = 20160.But then, we have to add back the cases where two forbidden squares are marked because they were subtracted twice. However, only two of the six possible pairs can actually be marked without conflict, each contributing 6! arrangements. So, 2 * 6! = 1440. Adding that back gives 20160 + 1440 = 21600.Since triplets and quadruplets of forbidden squares cannot be marked without conflict, we don't have to subtract or add anything else.So, 21,600 seems to be the answer.But let me think differently. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem without inclusion-exclusion.Since we have to place 8 rooks on the chessboard such that none are in the same row or column, and none are on the four corners. So, for each row, we have to choose a column, but certain columns are forbidden in certain rows.Specifically, in row 1, columns 1 and 8 are forbidden. Similarly, in row 8, columns 1 and 8 are forbidden. For the other rows (2 through 7), all columns are allowed except for the four corners, but wait, no, the forbidden squares are only the four corners. So, in rows 2 through 7, all columns are allowed except for the four corners, but actually, the four corners are only in rows 1 and 8.Wait, no. The four forbidden squares are (1,1), (1,8), (8,1), (8,8). So, in row 1, columns 1 and 8 are forbidden. In row 8, columns 1 and 8 are forbidden. For rows 2 through 7, all columns are allowed.So, this is similar to a permutation problem where certain positions are forbidden. Specifically, in the first row, two columns are forbidden, in the eighth row, two columns are forbidden, and in the other rows, all columns are allowed.This is similar to derangements but more specific. Maybe we can model this as a permutation matrix with forbidden positions.In combinatorics, the number of permutation matrices avoiding certain positions can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or by constructing a bipartite graph and finding the number of perfect matchings.Alternatively, we can model this as a permutation where certain elements cannot be mapped to certain positions.Let me think in terms of permutations. Let's label the rows as 1 through 8 and the columns as 1 through 8. We need a permutation σ where σ(1) ≠ 1 and σ(1) ≠ 8, σ(8) ≠ 1 and σ(8) ≠ 8, and for all other i (2 ≤ i ≤7), σ(i) can be any column.So, effectively, we have constraints on the first and eighth elements of the permutation.This is similar to counting the number of permutations with restricted positions. The general formula for such problems is given by the inclusion-exclusion principle, but in this case, since only two positions are restricted in two rows, maybe we can compute it directly.Let me try to compute it step by step.First, consider the first row. It has 8 columns, but two are forbidden: column 1 and column 8. So, for the first row, we have 6 choices.Similarly, the eighth row also has 6 choices: columns 2 through 7.However, the choices for the eighth row depend on what was chosen for the first row because we cannot have two rooks in the same column.So, it's similar to arranging two rooks in the first and eighth rows with certain forbidden columns, and then arranging the remaining rooks in the remaining rows and columns.Let me break it down:Case 1: The first row chooses a column that is also forbidden for the eighth row. Wait, no, the forbidden columns for the eighth row are 1 and 8, same as the first row. So, if the first row chooses column 1 or 8, which are forbidden for the eighth row, but actually, the first row cannot choose column 1 or 8. So, the first row chooses from columns 2 through 7, which are 6 columns.Similarly, the eighth row also chooses from columns 2 through 7, but cannot choose the same column as the first row.So, let's think of it as:First, choose a column for row 1: 6 choices.Then, choose a column for row 8: since it can't be the same as row 1's column, and it can't be column 1 or 8. So, from columns 2 through 7, excluding the column chosen by row 1, so 5 choices.Then, for the remaining rows (2 through 7), we have to assign the remaining columns (which are 8 - 2 = 6 columns, since two columns are already used by rows 1 and 8). But wait, actually, columns 1 and 8 are still available for rows 2 through 7, except that in rows 1 and 8, columns 1 and 8 are forbidden.Wait, no. The forbidden columns are only for rows 1 and 8. For rows 2 through 7, all columns are allowed, including 1 and 8.So, after choosing columns for rows 1 and 8, we have 6 columns left (since two columns are already used by rows 1 and 8). These 6 columns need to be assigned to the remaining 6 rows (2 through 7), with no restrictions.So, the number of ways is:6 (choices for row 1) * 5 (choices for row 8) * 6! (arrangements for rows 2-7)Calculating that: 6 * 5 = 30, and 6! = 720, so 30 * 720 = 21,600.Wait, that's the same answer as before! So, 21,600.So, whether I use inclusion-exclusion or model it as restricted permutations, I get the same result.Therefore, the number of ways is 21,600.Just to make sure, let me think if there's another perspective.Another way is to consider that we're counting the number of permutation matrices of size 8x8, avoiding the four corner positions. Each permutation matrix corresponds to a placement of 8 non-attacking rooks.The total number of permutation matrices is 8!.The number of permutation matrices that include at least one corner square can be calculated, and subtracting that from the total gives the desired count.But that's essentially what I did earlier with inclusion-exclusion.Alternatively, thinking about it as a bipartite graph where rows are connected to columns, except for the forbidden edges (the four corners). Then, the number of perfect matchings in this graph is the number we're looking for.In graph theory, the number of perfect matchings can sometimes be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which aligns with our earlier approach.So, in this bipartite graph, we have two sets: rows and columns. Each row is connected to all columns except for row 1, which is not connected to column 1 and 8, and row 8, which is not connected to column 1 and 8.So, the number of perfect matchings is equal to the number of permutation matrices avoiding the forbidden positions.This is a standard problem in combinatorics, often approached via inclusion-exclusion.Given that both methods give me 21,600, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.Therefore, the number of ways is 21,600.**Final Answer**The number of ways is boxed{21600}."},{"question":"A merchant first increases the original price of a color TV by 40%, and then offers a \\"20% discount\\". As a result, each color TV earns an additional 144 yuan compared to the original price. What is the original price of each color TV?","answer":"First, let's denote the original price of the color TV as ( x ) yuan.The merchant increases the original price by 40%, making the new price ( 1.4x ) yuan.Next, a 20% discount is applied to this increased price. The discounted price becomes ( 1.4x times 0.8 = 1.12x ) yuan.According to the problem, the final price after the discount is 144 yuan more than the original price.

If S_n=126, then n= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a sequence. Let me read it again: In the sequence {a_n}, a₁ = 2, and each term is double the previous one, so a_{n+1} = 2a_n. S_n is the sum of the first n terms, and they tell me that S_n = 126. I need to find n. Hmm, okay.Alright, let's start by understanding the sequence. The first term is 2, and each term is twice the previous one. So, this is a geometric sequence where the common ratio is 2. That makes sense because each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.So, the sequence goes like this: a₁ = 2, a₂ = 4, a₃ = 8, a₄ = 16, and so on. Each term is 2 raised to the power of n, right? Wait, let me check: a₁ is 2, which is 2¹, a₂ is 4, which is 2², a₃ is 8, which is 2³. So, yeah, in general, a_n = 2^n. That seems correct.Now, S_n is the sum of the first n terms. Since this is a geometric series, the sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The formula is S_n = a₁( r^n - 1 ) / ( r - 1 ), where a₁ is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.Plugging in the values we have: a₁ is 2, r is 2. So, the formula becomes S_n = 2(2^n - 1)/(2 - 1). Simplifying the denominator, 2 - 1 is 1, so S_n = 2(2^n - 1)/1, which is just 2(2^n - 1). So, S_n = 2^{n+1} - 2.Wait, let me verify that. If I expand 2(2^n - 1), that's 2*2^n - 2*1, which is 2^{n+1} - 2. Yeah, that's correct.So, we have S_n = 2^{n+1} - 2. And we know that S_n is 126. So, we can set up the equation:2^{n+1} - 2 = 126.Let me solve for n. First, add 2 to both sides:2^{n+1} = 128.Hmm, 128 is a power of 2. Let me recall: 2^7 = 128. So, 2^{n+1} = 2^7. Therefore, n + 1 = 7, so n = 6.Wait, let me double-check that. If n is 6, then S_6 should be 126. Let's compute S_6 using the formula.S_6 = 2^{6+1} - 2 = 2^7 - 2 = 128 - 2 = 126. Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, I can compute the sum manually to make sure. The terms are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. Adding them up: 2 + 4 = 6, 6 + 8 = 14, 14 + 16 = 30, 30 + 32 = 62, 62 + 64 = 126. Yep, that adds up.So, n is 6. I think that's the answer.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps, let me go through it again.1. The sequence is geometric with a₁ = 2 and r = 2.2. The sum of the first n terms is S_n = a₁(r^n - 1)/(r - 1).3. Plugging in, S_n = 2(2^n - 1)/1 = 2^{n+1} - 2.4. Set S_n = 126: 2^{n+1} - 2 = 126.5. Add 2: 2^{n+1} = 128.6. Recognize 128 as 2^7, so n + 1 = 7, so n = 6.All the steps seem solid. I don't see any errors here. So, yeah, n is definitely 6.I guess another way to approach this is by recognizing that the sum of a geometric series can also be written as S_n = a₁ + a₂ + ... + a_n. Since each term is double the previous, the sum is one less than the next term. Wait, let me think about that.In a geometric series where r = 2, the sum S_n is equal to a_{n+1} - a₁. Because each term is double, so the sum is like 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^n, which is equal to 2^{n+1} - 2. Yeah, that's consistent with what I had before.So, if S_n = 126, then 2^{n+1} - 2 = 126, leading to 2^{n+1} = 128, so n+1 = 7, n = 6. Yep, same result.I think I've confirmed it enough times. I don't see any other way this could go wrong unless I made a calculation mistake, but all the numbers check out.So, yeah, the answer is 6.**Final Answer**The value of ( n ) is boxed{6}."},{"question":"Given the parabola y^2 = 4x and its focus F, a line passing through F at an angle of 45^circ intersects the parabola at points A and B. Find the length of segment AB.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given the parabola ( y^2 = 4x ) and its focus F, a line passing through F at an angle of ( 45^circ ) intersects the parabola at points A and B. I need to find the length of segment AB.First, I remember that the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is ( y^2 = 4ax ), where the focus is at ( (a, 0) ). Comparing this to the given equation ( y^2 = 4x ), it looks like ( 4a = 4 ), so ( a = 1 ). That means the focus F is at ( (1, 0) ).Now, the problem says a line passes through F at a ( 45^circ ) angle. I need to figure out the equation of this line. Since it's at a ( 45^circ ) angle, the slope should be ( tan(45^circ) ), which is 1. So, the slope ( m = 1 ).Using the point-slope form of a line, which is ( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) ), and plugging in the focus point ( (1, 0) ), the equation becomes:[ y - 0 = 1 cdot (x - 1) ]Simplifying, that's:[ y = x - 1 ]So, the equation of the line is ( y = x - 1 ). Now, I need to find where this line intersects the parabola ( y^2 = 4x ). To do that, I'll substitute ( y ) from the line equation into the parabola equation.Substituting ( y = x - 1 ) into ( y^2 = 4x ), we get:[ (x - 1)^2 = 4x ]Expanding the left side:[ x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4x ]Bringing all terms to one side:[ x^2 - 2x + 1 - 4x = 0 ]Combine like terms:[ x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0 ]So, now I have a quadratic equation in terms of ( x ): ( x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0 ). I need to solve for ( x ) to find the points of intersection A and B.Using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -6 ), and ( c = 1 ):[ x = frac{-(-6) pm sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1}}{2 cdot 1} ]Simplify:[ x = frac{6 pm sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} ][ x = frac{6 pm sqrt{32}}{2} ]Simplify the square root:[ sqrt{32} = 4sqrt{2} ]So,[ x = frac{6 pm 4sqrt{2}}{2} ]Divide numerator terms by 2:[ x = 3 pm 2sqrt{2} ]Therefore, the x-coordinates of points A and B are ( 3 + 2sqrt{2} ) and ( 3 - 2sqrt{2} ), respectively.Now, to find the corresponding y-coordinates, I'll plug these x-values back into the equation of the line ( y = x - 1 ).For ( x = 3 + 2sqrt{2} ):[ y = (3 + 2sqrt{2}) - 1 = 2 + 2sqrt{2} ]So, point A is ( (3 + 2sqrt{2}, 2 + 2sqrt{2}) ).For ( x = 3 - 2sqrt{2} ):[ y = (3 - 2sqrt{2}) - 1 = 2 - 2sqrt{2} ]So, point B is ( (3 - 2sqrt{2}, 2 - 2sqrt{2}) ).Now, I need to find the distance between points A and B. The distance formula is:[ AB = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} ]Let me label point A as ( (x_1, y_1) = (3 + 2sqrt{2}, 2 + 2sqrt{2}) ) and point B as ( (x_2, y_2) = (3 - 2sqrt{2}, 2 - 2sqrt{2}) ).Calculate ( x_2 - x_1 ):[ (3 - 2sqrt{2}) - (3 + 2sqrt{2}) = 3 - 2sqrt{2} - 3 - 2sqrt{2} = -4sqrt{2} ]Calculate ( y_2 - y_1 ):[ (2 - 2sqrt{2}) - (2 + 2sqrt{2}) = 2 - 2sqrt{2} - 2 - 2sqrt{2} = -4sqrt{2} ]Now, plug these into the distance formula:[ AB = sqrt{(-4sqrt{2})^2 + (-4sqrt{2})^2} ]Calculate each square:[ (-4sqrt{2})^2 = 16 cdot 2 = 32 ]So, both terms are 32:[ AB = sqrt{32 + 32} = sqrt{64} = 8 ]So, the length of segment AB is 8 units.Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the quadratic equation: ( x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0 ). Using quadratic formula, discriminant is ( 36 - 4 = 32 ), so roots are ( (6 pm sqrt{32}) / 2 = 3 pm 2sqrt{2} ). That seems correct.Then, plugging back into ( y = x - 1 ), so ( y = 2 pm 2sqrt{2} ). That also looks correct.Then, calculating the differences in x and y coordinates: both differences are ( -4sqrt{2} ). Squaring those gives 32 each, adding to 64, square root is 8. Yep, that seems right.So, I think 8 is the correct length of AB.**Final Answer**The length of segment AB is boxed{8}."},{"question":"The function ( f(x) = x^2 - ax + 2a ) has integer roots. Find the sum of all possible values of ( a ).(A) 7  (B) 8  (C) 16  (D) 17  (E) 18","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where the function ( f(x) = x^2 - ax + 2a ) has integer roots, and I need to find the sum of all possible values of ( a ). The answer choices are given, so that might help me check my work as I go along.First, I remember that if a quadratic equation has integer roots, then those roots must satisfy certain conditions related to the coefficients of the equation. The general form of a quadratic equation is ( x^2 + bx + c = 0 ), and if it factors into ( (x - r)(x - s) = 0 ), then the sum of the roots ( r + s = -b ) and the product ( rs = c ).In this case, the quadratic is ( x^2 - ax + 2a ). So, comparing it to the general form, the coefficient of ( x ) is ( -a ), which would correspond to ( - (r + s) ), and the constant term is ( 2a ), which corresponds to ( rs ).So, translating that, we have:1. Sum of roots: ( r + s = a )2. Product of roots: ( rs = 2a )Hmm, so I have two equations here involving ( r ) and ( s ). Maybe I can substitute one into the other to find possible integer solutions.From the first equation, ( a = r + s ). Let's substitute this into the second equation:( rs = 2a = 2(r + s) )So, ( rs = 2r + 2s ). Let me rearrange this equation:( rs - 2r - 2s = 0 )Hmm, maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me try adding 4 to both sides to complete the square or factor it:( rs - 2r - 2s + 4 = 4 )Now, factor the left side:( (r - 2)(s - 2) = 4 )Ah, that seems useful! So, ( (r - 2)(s - 2) = 4 ). Since ( r ) and ( s ) are integers, ( r - 2 ) and ( s - 2 ) must be integer divisors of 4.Now, I can list all pairs of integers whose product is 4. Remembering that both positive and negative divisors are possible.The pairs are:1. (1, 4)2. (2, 2)3. (4, 1)4. (-1, -4)5. (-2, -2)6. (-4, -1)Wait, let me make sure I have all the possible pairs. Since 4 can be factored as:- 1 × 4- 2 × 2- 4 × 1- (-1) × (-4)- (-2) × (-2)- (-4) × (-1)Yes, that's all the possible pairs. So, for each of these pairs, I can find ( r ) and ( s ) by adding 2 back to each factor.Let me tabulate each case:1. ( r - 2 = 1 ) and ( s - 2 = 4 ):   - ( r = 3 ), ( s = 6 )   - Then, ( a = r + s = 3 + 6 = 9 )2. ( r - 2 = 2 ) and ( s - 2 = 2 ):   - ( r = 4 ), ( s = 4 )   - Then, ( a = 4 + 4 = 8 )3. ( r - 2 = 4 ) and ( s - 2 = 1 ):   - ( r = 6 ), ( s = 3 )   - Then, ( a = 6 + 3 = 9 ) (Same as case 1, just swapped)4. ( r - 2 = -1 ) and ( s - 2 = -4 ):   - ( r = 1 ), ( s = -2 )   - Then, ( a = 1 + (-2) = -1 )5. ( r - 2 = -2 ) and ( s - 2 = -2 ):   - ( r = 0 ), ( s = 0 )   - Then, ( a = 0 + 0 = 0 )6. ( r - 2 = -4 ) and ( s - 2 = -1 ):   - ( r = -2 ), ( s = 1 )   - Then, ( a = (-2) + 1 = -1 ) (Same as case 4, just swapped)So, compiling the values of ( a ) from each case:- Case 1 and 3: ( a = 9 )- Case 2: ( a = 8 )- Case 4 and 6: ( a = -1 )- Case 5: ( a = 0 )Wait, hold on. So, the possible values of ( a ) are 9, 8, -1, and 0. Let me check if I missed any pairs.Looking back, I considered all factor pairs of 4, both positive and negative. So, I think I have all possible cases.But let me verify each value of ( a ) to make sure that the quadratic indeed has integer roots.1. For ( a = 9 ):   The quadratic becomes ( x^2 - 9x + 18 ).   Factoring: ( (x - 3)(x - 6) = 0 ), roots at 3 and 6. Correct.2. For ( a = 8 ):   The quadratic becomes ( x^2 - 8x + 16 ).   Factoring: ( (x - 4)^2 = 0 ), root at 4 (double root). Correct.3. For ( a = -1 ):   The quadratic becomes ( x^2 - (-1)x + 2(-1) = x^2 + x - 2 ).   Factoring: ( (x + 2)(x - 1) = 0 ), roots at -2 and 1. Correct.4. For ( a = 0 ):   The quadratic becomes ( x^2 - 0x + 0 = x^2 ).   Factoring: ( x^2 = 0 ), root at 0 (double root). Correct.So, all these values of ( a ) are valid.Now, the question asks for the sum of all possible values of ( a ). So, let's add them up:9 + 8 + (-1) + 0 = 9 + 8 = 17; 17 + (-1) = 16; 16 + 0 = 16.Wait, that gives me 16. But looking at the answer choices, 16 is option (C). However, I remember that sometimes when you have multiple roots, especially in quadratics, you might have to consider multiplicities or something else.Wait, but in this case, each value of ( a ) is unique, right? So, 9, 8, -1, 0. So, adding them up: 9 + 8 is 17, 17 + (-1) is 16, 16 + 0 is 16. So, 16 is the total.But hold on, let me check if I considered all factor pairs. Maybe I missed some.The equation ( (r - 2)(s - 2) = 4 ). The integer pairs are:(1,4), (2,2), (4,1), (-1,-4), (-2,-2), (-4,-1). I think that's all because 4 is 2 squared, so its divisors are limited.Wait, but 4 can also be expressed as ( -1 × -4 ), which I have, and ( -2 × -2 ), which I have. So, I think that's all.Wait, but in my earlier calculation, when I added up 9 + 8 + (-1) + 0, I got 16. But in the answer choices, 16 is an option, but I also see 17. Maybe I missed an ( a ) value.Wait, let me recount the possible ( a ) values:From case 1 and 3: a = 9Case 2: a = 8Case 4 and 6: a = -1Case 5: a = 0So, four values: 9, 8, -1, 0.Sum is 9 + 8 + (-1) + 0 = 16.Wait, but let me check if a=0 is acceptable. If a=0, the quadratic becomes ( x^2 ), which has a double root at 0, which is an integer. So, yes, that's acceptable.Similarly, a=-1 gives roots at -2 and 1, which are integers.a=8 gives a double root at 4.a=9 gives roots at 3 and 6.So, all four values are acceptable.Therefore, the sum is 16, which is option (C).But hold on, let me check the problem statement again to make sure I didn't misread anything.\\"The function ( f(x) = x^2 - ax + 2a ) has integer roots. Find the sum of all possible values of ( a ).\\"Yes, that's what I did. So, 16 is the answer, which is option (C).But wait, the options are (A)7, (B)8, (C)16, (D)17, (E)18.So, 16 is an option, so that's probably the answer.But hold on, let me think again. Maybe I missed some factor pairs? For example, if I consider (r - 2) and (s - 2) as divisors of 4, but are there more possibilities?Wait, 4 can also be expressed as ( -1 × -4 ), but I already considered that. Also, ( -4 × -1 ), same as above.Wait, are there any other pairs? For example, ( -1, -4 ), ( -2, -2 ), ( -4, -1 ), (1,4 ), (2,2 ), (4,1 ). I think that's all.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the discriminant.Since the quadratic has integer roots, the discriminant must be a perfect square.The discriminant ( D = a^2 - 4 times 1 times 2a = a^2 - 8a ).So, ( D = a^2 - 8a ) must be a perfect square.Let me denote ( D = k^2 ), where ( k ) is an integer.So, ( a^2 - 8a = k^2 ).Let me rearrange this equation:( a^2 - 8a - k^2 = 0 ).This is a quadratic in terms of ( a ). Hmm, maybe not the most straightforward approach.Alternatively, I can write the equation as:( a^2 - 8a - k^2 = 0 ).But perhaps completing the square on the left-hand side:( a^2 - 8a = k^2 )( a^2 - 8a + 16 = k^2 + 16 )( (a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16 )So, ( (a - 4)^2 - k^2 = 16 )This can be factored as a difference of squares:( (a - 4 - k)(a - 4 + k) = 16 )So, now, we have two integers ( m = a - 4 - k ) and ( n = a - 4 + k ) such that ( m times n = 16 ).Also, since ( m ) and ( n ) are integers and ( m leq n ) (assuming order), we can list all pairs of integers ( (m, n) ) such that ( m times n = 16 ).Let me list all possible pairs:1. (1, 16)2. (2, 8)3. (4, 4)4. (-1, -16)5. (-2, -8)6. (-4, -4)Wait, are there more? For example, ( -1, -16 ), ( -2, -8 ), ( -4, -4 ), ( -8, -2 ), ( -16, -1 ). But since multiplication is commutative, some of these are duplicates in terms of the pairs.But in our case, since ( m = a - 4 - k ) and ( n = a - 4 + k ), and ( k ) is an integer, ( m ) and ( n ) must satisfy ( n > m ) if ( k ) is positive, but since ( k ) can be negative, we need to consider all possible pairs.But perhaps it's better to consider all factor pairs, positive and negative, regardless of order.So, the factor pairs of 16 are:(1, 16), (2, 8), (4, 4), (-1, -16), (-2, -8), (-4, -4), (16, 1), (8, 2), (-16, -1), (-8, -2)But since ( m times n = 16 ), and ( m ) and ( n ) can be positive or negative, but ( m ) and ( n ) must satisfy ( n geq m ) if we consider positive factors, but since negatives are allowed, we need to consider all.But perhaps a better way is to consider all possible pairs where ( m ) and ( n ) are integers such that ( m times n = 16 ).So, let me list all possible pairs:1. (1, 16)2. (2, 8)3. (4, 4)4. (-1, -16)5. (-2, -8)6. (-4, -4)7. (16, 1)8. (8, 2)9. (-16, -1)10. (-8, -2)So, 10 pairs in total.Now, for each pair ( (m, n) ), we can solve for ( a ) and ( k ).Given that ( m = a - 4 - k ) and ( n = a - 4 + k ), adding these two equations:( m + n = 2(a - 4) )So, ( a = frac{m + n}{2} + 4 )Similarly, subtracting the two equations:( n - m = 2k )So, ( k = frac{n - m}{2} )Since ( k ) must be an integer, ( n - m ) must be even, which implies that ( m ) and ( n ) must be both even or both odd. But since 16 is even, all its factor pairs consist of both even or both odd? Wait, 16 is 2^4, so all its factors are even except 1 and -1.Wait, 16 can be factored into:1 × 16: 1 is odd, 16 is even2 × 8: both even4 × 4: both evenSimilarly, negative pairs:-1 × -16: -1 is odd, -16 is even-2 × -8: both even-4 × -4: both evenSo, in the pairs where one is odd and the other is even, ( n - m ) will be odd, which would make ( k ) a non-integer, which is not allowed. Therefore, only the pairs where both factors are even will result in integer ( k ).So, let's eliminate the pairs where one factor is odd and the other is even:From the list above, pairs 1, 4, 7, 9 have one odd and one even factor. So, these will result in non-integer ( k ), so we can disregard them.So, remaining pairs are:2. (2, 8)3. (4, 4)5. (-2, -8)6. (-4, -4)8. (8, 2)10. (-8, -2)Wait, but pairs 2 and 8 are essentially the same, just reversed. Similarly, pairs 5 and 10 are the same, just reversed. So, to avoid duplication, let's consider each unique pair once.So, unique pairs where both factors are even:(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)Now, let's compute ( a ) for each of these.1. Pair (2, 8):   ( a = frac{2 + 8}{2} + 4 = frac{10}{2} + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 )2. Pair (4, 4):   ( a = frac{4 + 4}{2} + 4 = frac{8}{2} + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 )3. Pair (-2, -8):   ( a = frac{-2 + (-8)}{2} + 4 = frac{-10}{2} + 4 = -5 + 4 = -1 )4. Pair (-4, -4):   ( a = frac{-4 + (-4)}{2} + 4 = frac{-8}{2} + 4 = -4 + 4 = 0 )So, same results as before: ( a = 9, 8, -1, 0 ). So, the sum is 16.Therefore, the answer is 16, which is option (C).But hold on, in my initial approach, I considered ( (r - 2)(s - 2) = 4 ) and found the same ( a ) values. So, both methods lead to the same conclusion.Therefore, I can be confident that the sum is 16.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"(2014·Chongqing Simulation) Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} satisfies a_2+a_4=4, a_3+a_5=10, find the sum of the first 6 terms, S_6.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\\"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} satisfies a₂ + a₄ = 4, a₃ + a₅ = 10, find the sum of the first 6 terms, S₆.\\"Alright, first, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if the first term is a₁ and the common difference is d, then the nth term is a_n = a₁ + (n-1)d.So, for this sequence, let me write down the expressions for the terms mentioned:a₂ = a₁ + da₃ = a₁ + 2da₄ = a₁ + 3da₅ = a₁ + 4dOkay, so the problem gives me two equations:1. a₂ + a₄ = 42. a₃ + a₅ = 10Let me substitute the expressions I have into these equations.First equation:a₂ + a₄ = (a₁ + d) + (a₁ + 3d) = 2a₁ + 4d = 4Second equation:a₃ + a₅ = (a₁ + 2d) + (a₁ + 4d) = 2a₁ + 6d = 10So now I have a system of two equations:1. 2a₁ + 4d = 42. 2a₁ + 6d = 10Hmm, okay, let me write them down:Equation 1: 2a₁ + 4d = 4Equation 2: 2a₁ + 6d = 10I need to solve for a₁ and d. Maybe I can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate a₁.Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:(2a₁ + 6d) - (2a₁ + 4d) = 10 - 4Simplify:2a₁ + 6d - 2a₁ - 4d = 6So, 2d = 6Therefore, d = 3Okay, so the common difference d is 3. Now, let's plug this back into Equation 1 to find a₁.Equation 1: 2a₁ + 4d = 4Substitute d = 3:2a₁ + 4*3 = 42a₁ + 12 = 4Subtract 12 from both sides:2a₁ = 4 - 12 = -8Divide both sides by 2:a₁ = -4Alright, so the first term is -4, and the common difference is 3.Now, the problem asks for the sum of the first 6 terms, S₆.I remember that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:S_n = n/2 * (2a₁ + (n - 1)d)Alternatively, it can also be written as S_n = n*(a₁ + a_n)/2, where a_n is the nth term.Let me use the first formula:S₆ = 6/2 * (2a₁ + (6 - 1)d) = 3*(2a₁ + 5d)We already know a₁ = -4 and d = 3, so let's plug those in:S₆ = 3*(2*(-4) + 5*3) = 3*(-8 + 15) = 3*(7) = 21Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify using the other formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Using S_n = n*(a₁ + a_n)/2First, find a₆:a₆ = a₁ + 5d = -4 + 5*3 = -4 + 15 = 11So, S₆ = 6*(a₁ + a₆)/2 = 6*(-4 + 11)/2 = 6*(7)/2 = 6*3.5 = 21Same result. Okay, so that seems correct.Alternatively, I can list out the first six terms and add them up to check:a₁ = -4a₂ = a₁ + d = -4 + 3 = -1a₃ = a₂ + d = -1 + 3 = 2a₄ = a₃ + d = 2 + 3 = 5a₅ = a₄ + d = 5 + 3 = 8a₆ = a₅ + d = 8 + 3 = 11Now, adding them up:-4 + (-1) + 2 + 5 + 8 + 11Let me compute step by step:Start with -4.-4 + (-1) = -5-5 + 2 = -3-3 + 5 = 22 + 8 = 1010 + 11 = 21Yep, that's 21. So, the sum of the first six terms is 21.Just to recap, I found the common difference d by subtracting the two given equations, found a₁ by plugging back d into one of the equations, and then used the sum formula to find S₆. Verified it in multiple ways, so I'm confident it's correct.**Final Answer**The sum of the first 6 terms is boxed{21}."},{"question":"Given a<0,-1<b<0, what is the relationship between a, a b, and a b^{2}?(A) a > a b > a b^{2}.(B) a b^{2} > a b > a.(C) a b > a > a b^{2}.(D) a b > a b^{2} > a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out the relationship between three expressions: a, ab, and ab². The given conditions are that a is less than 0, which means a is negative, and b is between -1 and 0, so b is also negative but not as negative as -1. Hmm, interesting.Let me break this down. Since a is negative and b is negative, multiplying them together should give a positive result because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, ab is positive. Now, ab² would be a times b squared. Since b is negative, squaring it makes it positive, right? So, b² is positive, and then multiplying by a, which is negative, so ab² is negative.Wait, hold on. So ab is positive, and ab² is negative? That seems a bit counterintuitive, but let me verify. If a is negative and b is negative, then ab is positive. Then, b squared is positive, so ab² is negative because a is negative. Yeah, that makes sense.So, now I have a is negative, ab is positive, and ab² is negative. So, in terms of order, positive numbers are always greater than negative numbers. So, ab is greater than both a and ab². So, ab is the largest.Now, between a and ab², both are negative. So, I need to figure out which one is larger. Since a is negative and b is between -1 and 0, let's think about the magnitude. If I have a negative number a, and I multiply it by b², which is a positive number less than 1 because b is between -1 and 0. Squaring it makes it positive but still less than 1.So, multiplying a negative number by a positive number less than 1 makes it less negative. For example, if a is -2 and b is -0.5, then ab² would be -2*(0.25) = -0.5. So, a is -2, ab is (-2)*(-0.5)=1, and ab² is -0.5. So, in this case, ab is 1, which is positive, a is -2, and ab² is -0.5. So, ordering them: ab (1) is the largest, then ab² (-0.5) is next, and a (-2) is the smallest. So, the order is ab > ab² > a.Wait, but in my initial thought, I thought ab is positive, ab² is negative, so ab is greater than both. But between a and ab², which is greater? Since both are negative, the one closer to zero is greater. So, ab² is closer to zero than a, right? Because b² is less than 1, so ab² is a multiplied by a number less than 1, making it less negative.So, in terms of magnitude, |ab²| is less than |a| because b² is less than 1. So, since a is negative, ab² is closer to zero, meaning ab² is greater than a. So, the order is ab > ab² > a.Let me test this with another example to make sure. Let’s say a is -3 and b is -0.5. Then, ab is (-3)*(-0.5)=1.5, ab² is (-3)*(0.25)=-0.75, and a is -3. So, ordering them: ab=1.5 is the largest, then ab²=-0.75, and a=-3 is the smallest. So, again, ab > ab² > a.Another example: a=-1, b=-0.1. Then, ab= (-1)*(-0.1)=0.1, ab²= (-1)*(0.01)=-0.01, and a=-1. So, ordering: ab=0.1, ab²=-0.01, a=-1. So, same order: ab > ab² > a.Wait, but what if b is closer to -1? Let's say a=-2, b=-0.9. Then, ab= (-2)*(-0.9)=1.8, ab²= (-2)*(0.81)=-1.62, and a=-2. So, ordering: ab=1.8, ab²=-1.62, a=-2. So, same order: ab > ab² > a.Wait, but ab² is -1.62, which is greater than a=-2, because -1.62 is to the right of -2 on the number line. So, yes, ab² is greater than a.So, in all these cases, ab is positive, ab² is negative but closer to zero than a, so ab² is greater than a. Therefore, the order is ab > ab² > a.Looking back at the options:(A) a > ab > ab²(B) ab² > ab > a(C) ab > a > ab²(D) ab > ab² > aSo, the correct order is D: ab > ab² > a.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the signs again. Since a is negative, and b is negative, ab is positive. Then, ab² is a times b squared, which is a times a positive number less than 1, so ab² is negative but closer to zero. So, ab is positive, ab² is negative, a is negative. So, ab is the largest, then ab² is next, then a is the smallest. So, yes, D is correct.I think I got it. So, the answer should be D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"sin (-1200^{circ})cos 1290^{circ}+cos (-1020^{circ})cdotsin (-1050^{circ})=_______．","answer":"Okay, so I have this trigonometric expression to evaluate: sin(-1200°)cos(1290°) + cos(-1020°)sin(-1050°). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those angles. I remember that trigonometric functions have periodicity, so maybe I can simplify these angles by finding their equivalent angles within the first 360 degrees. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's recall that sine and cosine are periodic functions with a period of 360°, which means that sin(θ) = sin(θ + 360°k) and cos(θ) = cos(θ + 360°k) for any integer k. Also, I remember that sine is an odd function, so sin(-θ) = -sin(θ), and cosine is an even function, so cos(-θ) = cos(θ). These properties might help simplify the expression.Let me start by simplifying each angle individually.Starting with sin(-1200°). Since sine is an odd function, sin(-1200°) = -sin(1200°). Now, I need to find sin(1200°). To simplify 1200°, I can divide it by 360° to find how many full rotations that is and then find the remaining angle.1200 ÷ 360 = 3.333... So that's 3 full rotations (which is 1080°) plus 120°. So, 1200° = 360°×3 + 120°, which means sin(1200°) = sin(120°). Therefore, sin(-1200°) = -sin(120°).Now, sin(120°) is a known value. 120° is in the second quadrant, and its reference angle is 60°, so sin(120°) = sin(60°) = √3/2. Therefore, sin(-1200°) = -√3/2.Next, let's simplify cos(1290°). Again, we can subtract multiples of 360° to find an equivalent angle between 0° and 360°. Let's divide 1290 by 360.1290 ÷ 360 = 3.583... So that's 3 full rotations (1080°) plus 210°. So, 1290° = 360°×3 + 210°, which means cos(1290°) = cos(210°).210° is in the third quadrant, and its reference angle is 30°, so cos(210°) = -cos(30°) = -√3/2. Therefore, cos(1290°) = -√3/2.Moving on to cos(-1020°). Since cosine is an even function, cos(-1020°) = cos(1020°). Let's simplify 1020°.1020 ÷ 360 = 2.833... So that's 2 full rotations (720°) plus 300°. So, 1020° = 360°×2 + 300°, which means cos(1020°) = cos(300°).300° is in the fourth quadrant, and its reference angle is 60°, so cos(300°) = cos(60°) = 1/2. Therefore, cos(-1020°) = 1/2.Lastly, sin(-1050°). Since sine is an odd function, sin(-1050°) = -sin(1050°). Let's simplify 1050°.1050 ÷ 360 = 2.916... So that's 2 full rotations (720°) plus 330°. So, 1050° = 360°×2 + 330°, which means sin(1050°) = sin(330°).330° is in the fourth quadrant, and its reference angle is 30°, so sin(330°) = -sin(30°) = -1/2. Therefore, sin(-1050°) = -(-1/2) = 1/2.Now, let's substitute all these simplified values back into the original expression:sin(-1200°)cos(1290°) + cos(-1020°)sin(-1050°) = (-√3/2)(-√3/2) + (1/2)(1/2)Let me compute each term separately.First term: (-√3/2)(-√3/2) = (√3 × √3)/(2 × 2) = (3)/4 = 3/4Second term: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4Now, adding these two terms together: 3/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations.First term: (-√3/2) * (-√3/2) = (√3 * √3) / (2 * 2) = 3/4. That seems correct.Second term: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. That also seems correct.Adding them: 3/4 + 1/4 = 1. Hmm, so the result is 1. That seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the angles.Let me go through each angle again.Starting with sin(-1200°):-1200° divided by 360°: 1200 / 360 = 3.333..., so 3 full rotations (1080°). 1200 - 1080 = 120°, so sin(-1200°) = -sin(120°) = -√3/2. Correct.cos(1290°):1290 / 360 = 3.583..., so 3 full rotations (1080°). 1290 - 1080 = 210°, so cos(210°) = -√3/2. Correct.cos(-1020°):-1020°, but cosine is even, so cos(1020°). 1020 / 360 = 2.833..., so 2 full rotations (720°). 1020 - 720 = 300°, cos(300°) = 1/2. Correct.sin(-1050°):-1050°, sine is odd, so -sin(1050°). 1050 / 360 = 2.916..., so 2 full rotations (720°). 1050 - 720 = 330°, sin(330°) = -1/2, so sin(-1050°) = -(-1/2) = 1/2. Correct.So all the angle simplifications are correct. Then, substituting back:(-√3/2)(-√3/2) = (√3 * √3)/(2 * 2) = 3/4(1/2)(1/2) = 1/4Adding them: 3/4 + 1/4 = 1Hmm, so the result is 1. That seems surprisingly simple. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using trigonometric identities.Looking at the original expression: sin A cos B + cos C sin D. Wait, that's similar to the sine addition formula: sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. But in our case, the angles are different: sin(-1200°)cos(1290°) + cos(-1020°)sin(-1050°). So unless A, B, C, D are related in a way that A + B = C + D or something, but I don't think that's the case here.Alternatively, maybe we can group the terms differently or factor something out, but I don't see an immediate identity that applies here. So perhaps computing each term separately is the right approach, and the result is indeed 1.Wait, but let me verify with another method. Maybe using the unit circle or considering the quadrants.But since I already simplified each angle and computed the sine and cosine values, and the arithmetic checks out, I think the result is correct.So, after simplifying each trigonometric function, I found that the expression equals 1.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"How many different ways can 6 different books be distributed according to the following requirements?  (1) Among three people, A, B, and C, one person gets 1 book, another gets 2 books, and the last one gets 3 books;  (2) The books are evenly distributed to A, B, and C, with each person getting 2 books;  (3) The books are divided into three parts, with one part getting 4 books and the other two parts getting 1 book each;  (4) A gets 1 book, B gets 1 book, and C gets 4 books.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about distributing 6 different books among three people, A, B, and C. There are four different scenarios, and I need to figure out how many ways each can happen. Let me take them one by one.Starting with the first one: (1) Among three people, A, B, and C, one person gets 1 book, another gets 2 books, and the last one gets 3 books. Hmm, okay. So, each person gets a different number of books: 1, 2, and 3. Since the books are different, the order matters here.First, I think I need to figure out how to assign the number of books each person gets. There are 3 people and 3 different quantities: 1, 2, 3. So, the number of ways to assign these quantities to A, B, and C is the number of permutations of 3 items, which is 3! = 6. So, 6 ways to decide who gets 1, who gets 2, and who gets 3.Now, once we've assigned the quantities, we need to figure out how to distribute the books. Since the books are different, the number of ways to choose which books go to each person is a combination problem.So, let's break it down. Suppose we decide that A gets 1 book, B gets 2, and C gets 3. Then, the number of ways to choose 1 book out of 6 for A is C(6,1). Then, from the remaining 5 books, we choose 2 for B, which is C(5,2). Then, the remaining 3 go to C, which is C(3,3). So, the total number of ways for this specific assignment is C(6,1) * C(5,2) * C(3,3).Calculating that: C(6,1) is 6, C(5,2) is 10, and C(3,3) is 1. So, 6 * 10 * 1 = 60.But since the assignment of the number of books can be done in 6 different ways (as we figured earlier), we need to multiply this by 6. So, 60 * 6 = 360.Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Because actually, when we assign the number of books to each person, each specific assignment (like A:1, B:2, C:3) already accounts for a unique distribution. So, if I calculate the number of distributions for one assignment and then multiply by the number of assignments, that should give the total number of distributions.But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as first choosing the person who gets 1 book, then the person who gets 2, and then the person who gets 3. So, 3 choices for who gets 1, then 2 remaining choices for who gets 2, and the last person gets 3. So, that's 3! = 6 ways, same as before.Then, for each of these, the number of ways to distribute the books is C(6,1) * C(5,2) * C(3,3) = 6 * 10 * 1 = 60. So, total is 6 * 60 = 360.Wait, but another way to think about it is: the number of ways to distribute the books is the multinomial coefficient. The formula for distributing n distinct objects into groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km is n! / (k1! k2! ... km!). So, in this case, n=6, and the group sizes are 1, 2, 3. So, the number of ways is 6! / (1! 2! 3!) = 720 / (1*2*6) = 720 / 12 = 60. But this is just for one specific assignment of group sizes to people.But since the group sizes can be assigned to different people, we have to multiply by the number of assignments, which is 3! = 6. So, 60 * 6 = 360. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.So, I think 360 is the answer for part (1). Let me just make sure I didn't overcount or undercount. Each distribution is unique because the books are different, and the people are distinct. So, assigning different numbers of books to different people and then distributing the books accordingly should cover all possibilities without overlap. Yeah, I think that's solid.Moving on to part (2): The books are evenly distributed to A, B, and C, with each person getting 2 books. Okay, so each person gets exactly 2 books. Since the books are different, the order matters.So, how do we calculate this? It's similar to the first problem, but now each person gets the same number of books. So, the number of ways is the multinomial coefficient again. The formula is 6! / (2! 2! 2!) because we're dividing 6 books into three groups of 2 each.Calculating that: 720 / (2*2*2) = 720 / 8 = 90. So, 90 ways.But wait, is that all? Since the people are distinct, does this account for assigning different sets to different people? Let me think. Yes, because the multinomial coefficient already considers the different assignments. For example, choosing which two books go to A, then which two go to B, and the remaining go to C. So, yes, 90 is correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is: first choose 2 books out of 6 for A, which is C(6,2) = 15. Then, choose 2 out of the remaining 4 for B, which is C(4,2) = 6. Then, the last 2 go to C, which is C(2,2) = 1. So, total ways: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90. Same result.So, I'm confident that part (2) is 90.Moving on to part (3): The books are divided into three parts, with one part getting 4 books and the other two parts getting 1 book each. Hmm, okay. So, we're dividing 6 books into three groups: one group of 4, and two groups of 1.But wait, the problem says \\"divided into three parts,\\" so does that mean that each part is assigned to A, B, and C? Or is it just partitioning the books into three parts regardless of who gets them? Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear.Looking back: \\"The books are divided into three parts, with one part getting 4 books and the other two parts getting 1 book each.\\" It doesn't specify whether these parts are assigned to people or just partitioned. But since the previous parts mentioned distributing to A, B, and C, I think in this case, it's also about distributing to A, B, and C, but the distribution is such that one person gets 4 books, and the other two get 1 each.So, similar to part (1), we need to assign the number of books to each person, then distribute the books accordingly.So, first, decide which person gets 4 books, and which two get 1 each. There are 3 choices for who gets 4 books, and the other two automatically get 1 each.Then, for each such assignment, the number of ways to distribute the books is C(6,4) * C(2,1) * C(1,1). Let's compute that.C(6,4) is 15, C(2,1) is 2, and C(1,1) is 1. So, 15 * 2 * 1 = 30.Since there are 3 choices for who gets 4 books, total number of distributions is 3 * 30 = 90.Wait, but hold on. Is this correct? Because when we choose 4 books for one person, then 1 for another, and 1 for the last, we have to consider that the two people getting 1 book each are distinct. So, does the order matter here?Wait, in the calculation above, when we choose 4 books for person X, then 1 book for person Y, and the last 1 for person Z, we are already considering the distinctness of Y and Z. So, for each assignment of who gets 4, the rest is determined, and the multiplication by 3 accounts for all possible assignments.Alternatively, using the multinomial coefficient: the number of ways to divide 6 books into groups of 4,1,1 is 6! / (4! 1! 1!) = 720 / (24 * 1 * 1) = 30. But since the two groups of 1 are indistinct in size, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange those two groups, which is 2!. So, 30 / 2 = 15. But wait, no, because in this problem, the groups are assigned to specific people, so the two single books are going to different people, so we don't divide by 2!.Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.If we were just partitioning the books into three parts without assigning them to people, then the number of ways would be 6! / (4! 1! 1!) / 2! = 15, because the two single-book parts are indistinct. But in our case, since we are assigning each part to a specific person, the two single-book parts are actually distinct because they go to different people. So, we don't divide by 2!.Therefore, the number of ways is 6! / (4! 1! 1!) = 30. Then, since we have 3 choices for who gets the 4-book part, the total number is 3 * 30 = 90.Wait, but hold on, that seems conflicting with the earlier thought. Let me think again.Alternatively, if we fix who gets 4 books, say person A, then the number of ways is C(6,4) * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = 15 * 2 * 1 = 30. Since person A is fixed, and then person B and C get the remaining books. But since person B and C are distinct, the order matters. So, for each selection of 4 books for A, we have 2 choices for which single book goes to B and which goes to C. So, 15 * 2 = 30.Therefore, for each assignment of who gets 4 books, it's 30. Since there are 3 assignments, total is 90.Alternatively, another way: the number of ways to choose 4 books for one person is C(6,4)=15, then assign the remaining 2 books to the other two people, which is 2! = 2 ways (since each gets one). So, 15 * 2 = 30. Then, since we can choose any of the 3 people to get the 4 books, 30 * 3 = 90.Yes, that makes sense. So, 90 is the answer for part (3).Wait, but hold on, let me verify with the multinomial approach. The multinomial coefficient for dividing into groups of 4,1,1 is 6! / (4!1!1!) = 30. But since the two single-book groups are assigned to different people, we don't need to divide by anything. So, 30 ways for each assignment of who gets 4. Since there are 3 choices for who gets 4, total is 3 * 30 = 90. Yep, consistent.So, part (3) is 90.Now, part (4): A gets 1 book, B gets 1 book, and C gets 4 books. Okay, so this is similar to part (3), but now the distribution is fixed: A:1, B:1, C:4. So, unlike part (3) where any of the three could get 4, here it's specifically C who gets 4, and A and B get 1 each.So, how do we calculate this? Well, since the distribution is fixed, we don't need to multiply by the number of assignments. We just need to compute the number of ways to choose 1 book for A, 1 book for B, and the remaining 4 for C.So, first, choose 1 book out of 6 for A: C(6,1)=6. Then, choose 1 book out of the remaining 5 for B: C(5,1)=5. The remaining 4 books go to C: C(4,4)=1. So, total number of ways is 6 * 5 * 1 = 30.Alternatively, using the multinomial coefficient: 6! / (1!1!4!) = 720 / (1*1*24) = 30. So, same result.Therefore, part (4) is 30.Wait, but let me think again. Since A and B are getting 1 book each, and C is getting 4, is there any overcounting? For example, does choosing book X for A and book Y for B count differently than choosing book Y for A and book X for B? Yes, because A and B are distinct people. So, these are two different distributions. Therefore, the multiplication by 6 * 5 is correct because it accounts for the different assignments to A and B.So, yes, 30 is correct.To recap:(1) 360 ways(2) 90 ways(3) 90 ways(4) 30 waysI think that's all. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.For part (1), since the distribution is 1,2,3, and the people are distinct, the number of assignments is 3!, and for each assignment, the number of distributions is 6!/(1!2!3!)=60, so total 6*60=360.For part (2), even distribution, each gets 2, so multinomial coefficient 6!/(2!2!2!)=90.For part (3), one person gets 4, others get 1 each. Number of assignments is 3, and for each, number of distributions is 6!/(4!1!1!)=30, so total 3*30=90.For part (4), fixed distribution: A:1, B:1, C:4. So, number of ways is 6!/(1!1!4!)=30.Yes, that all adds up.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{360}(2) boxed{90}(3) boxed{90}(4) boxed{30}"},{"question":"To understand the learning situation of 72 students, the method of systematic sampling is used to draw a sample of size 8.

Let me first write down the function to make sure I have it correctly:f(x) is defined as:- 1 + log₂(2 - x) when x < 1- 2^{x - 1} when x ≥ 1Alright, so I need to compute f(-2) and f(log₂12) separately and then add them together.Starting with f(-2). Since -2 is less than 1, I should use the first case of the function: 1 + log₂(2 - x). Let me plug in x = -2.So, f(-2) = 1 + log₂(2 - (-2)) = 1 + log₂(2 + 2) = 1 + log₂(4). Hmm, log base 2 of 4 is 2 because 2² = 4. So, f(-2) = 1 + 2 = 3. That seems straightforward.Now, moving on to f(log₂12). I need to figure out which case of the function to use here. First, let me compute log₂12 to see if it's less than 1 or greater than or equal to 1.I know that log₂8 = 3 because 2³ = 8, and log₂16 = 4 because 2⁴ = 16. Since 12 is between 8 and 16, log₂12 must be between 3 and 4. Specifically, log₂12 is approximately 3.58496, but I don't need the exact decimal value. I just need to know that it's greater than 1. Therefore, I should use the second case of the function: 2^{x - 1}.So, f(log₂12) = 2^{(log₂12) - 1}. Let me simplify this expression. Remember that 2^{a - b} = 2^a / 2^b, so this becomes 2^{log₂12} / 2^1.Now, 2^{log₂12} is just 12 because 2 raised to the power of log base 2 of 12 is 12. So, substituting that in, we have 12 / 2 = 6. Therefore, f(log₂12) = 6.Wait, let me double-check that step. So, 2^{log₂12} is indeed 12 because they are inverse functions. Yes, that part is correct. Then, dividing by 2 gives 6. So, that seems right.Now, adding the two results together: f(-2) + f(log₂12) = 3 + 6 = 9.Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify each step again.First, for f(-2):- x = -2 < 1, so we use 1 + log₂(2 - x)- 2 - (-2) = 4- log₂4 = 2- 1 + 2 = 3That's correct.Next, for f(log₂12):- log₂12 is approximately 3.58496, which is greater than 1, so we use 2^{x - 1}- x = log₂12, so 2^{log₂12 - 1} = 2^{log₂12} / 2^1 = 12 / 2 = 6That also checks out.Adding them together: 3 + 6 = 9. Yep, that seems right.I don't think I made any mistakes here. Both steps are pretty straightforward, and the function is piecewise, so as long as I correctly identified which piece to use for each x value, the calculations should be accurate.Just to make sure, let me think about the function definitions again. For x < 1, it's 1 + log₂(2 - x). So, plugging in x = -2, 2 - (-2) is 4, log₂4 is 2, so 1 + 2 is 3. Perfect.For x ≥ 1, it's 2^{x - 1}. So, plugging in x = log₂12, which is about 3.58496, so 2^{3.58496 - 1} = 2^{2.58496}. Wait, hold on, that seems different from what I did earlier.Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 2^{x - 1} where x = log₂12 is 2^{log₂12 - 1}, which is equal to 2^{log₂12} * 2^{-1} = (12) * (1/2) = 6. So, that's correct. Alternatively, 2^{log₂12 - 1} is the same as 2^{log₂12} / 2^1, which is 12 / 2 = 6. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, if I compute 2^{2.58496}, since log₂12 ≈ 3.58496, so 3.58496 - 1 = 2.58496, and 2^{2.58496} ≈ 2^{2 + 0.58496} = 2² * 2^{0.58496}. 2² is 4, and 2^{0.58496} is approximately 1.5 because log₂(1.5) ≈ 0.58496. So, 4 * 1.5 = 6. So, that also gives me 6. So, that's consistent as well.Therefore, f(log₂12) is indeed 6.So, putting it all together, f(-2) is 3, f(log₂12) is 6, so 3 + 6 is 9.I think that's solid.

Calculate the sum of all numbers ( v(X) ) where ( X ) ranges over all nonempty subsets of the set ({1,2,3, ldots, 16}).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to calculate the sum of all numbers ( v(X) ) where ( X ) ranges over all nonempty subsets of the set ({1,2,3, ldots, 16}). Here, ( v(X) ) is defined as the sum of the elements in the subset ( X ). Hmm, okay. So, I need to consider every possible nonempty subset of the numbers from 1 to 16, calculate the sum of each subset, and then add all those sums together. That sounds like a lot of subsets! The set has 16 elements, so the total number of subsets is ( 2^{16} ), which is 65,536. But since we're only considering nonempty subsets, that's 65,535 subsets. Calculating each subset's sum individually and then adding them up would be impractical. There must be a smarter way to approach this.Let me think about how each number contributes to the total sum. For each number in the original set, how many times does it appear in all the subsets? If I can figure that out, I can multiply each number by the number of times it appears and then sum those products to get the total.So, for a specific number, say 1, how many subsets include it? Well, for any subset that includes 1, the other elements can be any combination of the remaining 15 numbers. So, the number of subsets that include 1 is ( 2^{15} ). Similarly, the same logic applies to every number from 1 to 16. Each number appears in exactly ( 2^{15} ) subsets.Therefore, each number contributes ( text{number} times 2^{15} ) to the total sum. So, the total sum ( S ) would be ( 2^{15} times (1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 16) ).Now, I need to compute the sum ( 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 16 ). I remember that the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is given by ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). Plugging in ( n = 16 ), we get:[frac{16 times 17}{2} = frac{272}{2} = 136]So, the sum of numbers from 1 to 16 is 136. Therefore, the total sum ( S ) is:[S = 2^{15} times 136]Calculating ( 2^{15} ) first. I know that ( 2^{10} = 1024 ), so ( 2^{15} = 2^{10} times 2^5 = 1024 times 32 = 32,768 ).Now, multiplying 32,768 by 136. Let me do that step by step:First, multiply 32,768 by 100: that's 3,276,800.Then, multiply 32,768 by 30: 32,768 x 30. Let's see, 32,768 x 10 = 327,680, so times 3 is 983,040.Next, multiply 32,768 by 6: 32,768 x 6 = 196,608.Now, add them all together:3,276,800 (from 100) + 983,040 (from 30) = 4,259,840Then, add 196,608 (from 6): 4,259,840 + 196,608 = 4,456,448So, the total sum ( S ) is 4,456,448.Wait, let me double-check my multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can use another method.Alternatively, 136 can be broken down into 100 + 30 + 6, which is what I did, so that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 32,768 x 136 as follows:32,768 x 136 = 32,768 x (100 + 30 + 6) = 32,768x100 + 32,768x30 + 32,768x6Which is exactly what I did earlier, so 3,276,800 + 983,040 + 196,608.Adding 3,276,800 + 983,040: Let's add 3,276,800 + 900,000 = 4,176,800, then add 83,040: 4,176,800 + 83,040 = 4,259,840.Then, adding 196,608: 4,259,840 + 196,608. Let's add 4,259,840 + 100,000 = 4,359,840, then subtract 3,392 (since 196,608 - 100,000 = 96,608, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 196,608 is 100,000 + 96,608. So, 4,259,840 + 100,000 = 4,359,840, then +96,608.Adding 4,359,840 + 96,608: 4,359,840 + 90,000 = 4,449,840, then +6,608 = 4,456,448. So, same result.Therefore, my calculation seems consistent.Alternatively, I can compute 32,768 x 136 by another method. Let's see:32,768 x 136= 32,768 x (100 + 30 + 6)= 32,768 x 100 + 32,768 x 30 + 32,768 x 6= 3,276,800 + 983,040 + 196,608= 3,276,800 + 983,040 = 4,259,8404,259,840 + 196,608 = 4,456,448Same result again. So, I think that's correct.Therefore, the sum of all ( v(X) ) for nonempty subsets ( X ) of ({1,2,3,ldots,16}) is 4,456,448.But just to make sure, let me think about the logic again. Each element appears in ( 2^{15} ) subsets, so each contributes ( text{element} times 2^{15} ) to the total sum. Then, adding all those contributions together gives the total sum. That seems correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each element, the number of subsets it appears in is ( 2^{n-1} ) where ( n ) is the total number of elements, which is 16 here. So, ( 2^{15} ) subsets per element. So, the total sum is ( 2^{15} times ) sum of elements.Sum of elements is 136, as calculated earlier. So, 32,768 x 136 = 4,456,448.Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 4,456,448.**Final Answer**The sum of all numbers ( v(X) ) is boxed{4456448}."},{"question":"Given ( z = (a - i)(1 + i) ) where ( a in mathbb{R} ) and ( i ) is the imaginary unit, if the point corresponding to the complex number ( z ) in the complex plane lies on the real axis, then ( a = ) _________ .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given ( z = (a - i)(1 + i) ) where ( a ) is a real number and ( i ) is the imaginary unit. The problem says that the point corresponding to the complex number ( z ) lies on the real axis in the complex plane, and I need to find the value of ( a ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in the complex plane, any complex number can be represented as ( x + yi ), where ( x ) is the real part and ( y ) is the imaginary part. The real axis is where all the imaginary parts are zero, so if ( z ) lies on the real axis, that means the imaginary part of ( z ) must be zero. So, my goal is to expand the expression for ( z ) and then set the imaginary part equal to zero to solve for ( a ).Alright, let's start by expanding ( z = (a - i)(1 + i) ). I'll use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for multiplying two binomials. First, I'll multiply the First terms: ( a times 1 = a ).Next, the Outer terms: ( a times i = ai ).Then, the Inner terms: ( -i times 1 = -i ).Lastly, the Last terms: ( -i times i = -i^2 ).So, putting it all together, we have:( z = a + ai - i - i^2 ).Now, I need to simplify this expression. I remember that ( i^2 = -1 ), so ( -i^2 = -(-1) = 1 ). Let me substitute that in:( z = a + ai - i + 1 ).Now, let's combine like terms. The real parts are ( a ) and ( 1 ), and the imaginary parts are ( ai ) and ( -i ).So, combining the real parts: ( a + 1 ).Combining the imaginary parts: ( ai - i = (a - 1)i ).Therefore, the expression simplifies to:( z = (a + 1) + (a - 1)i ).Now, as I thought earlier, since ( z ) lies on the real axis, the imaginary part must be zero. That means the coefficient of ( i ) in the expression for ( z ) has to be zero. So, I can set the imaginary part equal to zero:( a - 1 = 0 ).Solving for ( a ), I just add 1 to both sides:( a = 1 ).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the expansion:( (a - i)(1 + i) = a(1) + a(i) - i(1) - i(i) = a + ai - i - i^2 ).Simplify ( -i^2 ) to 1, so:( a + ai - i + 1 ).Combine real parts: ( a + 1 ).Combine imaginary parts: ( ai - i = (a - 1)i ).So, ( z = (a + 1) + (a - 1)i ). Since it's on the real axis, the imaginary part is zero:( a - 1 = 0 ) leads to ( a = 1 ).Yep, that seems correct. Let me just verify by plugging ( a = 1 ) back into the original expression to see if ( z ) is indeed a real number.Substituting ( a = 1 ):( z = (1 - i)(1 + i) ).Multiply this out:( 1 times 1 = 1 ),( 1 times i = i ),( -i times 1 = -i ),( -i times i = -i^2 = 1 ).So, adding them up:( 1 + i - i + 1 = 1 + 0i + 1 = 2 ).Which is a real number, as expected. So, ( z = 2 ) when ( a = 1 ), which lies on the real axis. Therefore, my answer is correct.I think I got it. So, ( a ) must be 1.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"A pair of positive integers  (m,n)  is called *compatible* if  m ge tfrac{1}{2} n + 7  and  n ge tfrac{1}{2} m + 7 .  A positive integer  k ge 1  is called *lonely* if  (k,ell)  is not compatible for any integer  ell ge 1 .  Find the sum of all lonely integers.*Proposed by Evan Chen*","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about compatible pairs of positive integers and lonely integers. Let me try to understand what it's asking.First, a pair (m, n) is called compatible if two conditions are satisfied:1. m is greater than or equal to (1/2)n + 72. n is greater than or equal to (1/2)m + 7And a positive integer k is called lonely if (k, ℓ) is not compatible for any integer ℓ ≥ 1. So, k is lonely if there's no ℓ such that (k, ℓ) is compatible. My task is to find all such lonely integers and sum them up.Alright, let me break this down. I need to figure out for which k, there does not exist any ℓ such that both k ≥ (1/2)ℓ + 7 and ℓ ≥ (1/2)k + 7 hold. So, for k to be lonely, for every ℓ ≥ 1, at least one of these inequalities must fail.Alternatively, if I can find that for some k, there exists no ℓ such that both inequalities hold, then k is lonely. So, my goal is to find all k where this is true.Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can solve the inequalities for ℓ in terms of k and see if there's any overlap.Starting with the first inequality: k ≥ (1/2)ℓ + 7. Let's solve for ℓ:Multiply both sides by 2: 2k ≥ ℓ + 14Subtract 14: ℓ ≤ 2k - 14Similarly, the second inequality: ℓ ≥ (1/2)k + 7. Let's solve for ℓ:Multiply both sides by 2: 2ℓ ≥ k + 14So, ℓ ≥ (k + 14)/2So, combining both inequalities, for a pair (k, ℓ) to be compatible, ℓ must satisfy:(k + 14)/2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k - 14So, for a given k, ℓ must lie in this interval. If this interval is non-empty, then there exists some ℓ such that (k, ℓ) is compatible. If the interval is empty, then k is lonely.Therefore, k is lonely if (k + 14)/2 > 2k - 14.Let me write that inequality:(k + 14)/2 > 2k - 14Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:k + 14 > 4k - 28Subtract k from both sides:14 > 3k - 28Add 28 to both sides:42 > 3kDivide both sides by 3:14 > kSo, k < 14.Therefore, for k < 14, the interval (k + 14)/2 to 2k - 14 is empty, meaning there's no ℓ that satisfies both inequalities. Therefore, k is lonely if k < 14.But wait, hold on. Let me check this because I might have made a mistake.Wait, so the interval is (k + 14)/2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2k - 14. For this interval to be non-empty, the lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound:(k + 14)/2 ≤ 2k - 14Multiply both sides by 2:k + 14 ≤ 4k - 28Subtract k:14 ≤ 3k - 28Add 28:42 ≤ 3kDivide by 3:14 ≤ kSo, when k ≥ 14, the interval is non-empty, meaning there exists some ℓ such that (k, ℓ) is compatible. Therefore, k is not lonely when k ≥ 14.But when k < 14, the interval is empty, so there is no ℓ such that (k, ℓ) is compatible. Therefore, all k < 14 are lonely.But wait, hold on. Let me test this with k = 13.For k = 13, let's compute (k + 14)/2 = (13 + 14)/2 = 27/2 = 13.5And 2k - 14 = 26 - 14 = 12So, the interval is 13.5 ≤ ℓ ≤ 12, which is empty. So, indeed, for k = 13, there's no ℓ that satisfies both inequalities. So, 13 is lonely.Similarly, for k = 14:(k + 14)/2 = (14 + 14)/2 = 28/2 = 142k - 14 = 28 - 14 = 14So, the interval is 14 ≤ ℓ ≤ 14, meaning ℓ = 14. So, (14,14) is compatible.Therefore, k = 14 is not lonely.Wait, so k = 14 is not lonely because ℓ = 14 works. So, that's consistent.Similarly, let's check k = 1:(k + 14)/2 = (1 + 14)/2 = 15/2 = 7.52k - 14 = 2 - 14 = -12So, ℓ must satisfy 7.5 ≤ ℓ ≤ -12, which is impossible. So, k = 1 is lonely.Similarly, k = 2:(k + 14)/2 = 16/2 = 82k - 14 = 4 - 14 = -10So, ℓ must be between 8 and -10, which is impossible. So, k = 2 is lonely.Wait, but hold on. Let me think about k = 14. If k = 14, then ℓ must be at least (14 + 14)/2 = 14, and at most 2*14 -14 = 14. So, ℓ must be exactly 14. So, (14,14) is compatible.Similarly, for k = 15:(k + 14)/2 = 29/2 = 14.52k -14 = 30 -14 = 16So, ℓ must be between 14.5 and 16. So, ℓ can be 15 or 16.So, (15,15) is compatible because 15 ≥ (1/2)*15 +7 = 7.5 +7 = 14.5, which is true, and 15 ≥ (1/2)*15 +7, same thing.Similarly, (15,16): 15 ≥ (1/2)*16 +7 = 8 +7 =15, which is exactly 15, so that's okay. And 16 ≥ (1/2)*15 +7 =7.5 +7=14.5, which is true.So, k =15 is not lonely.Wait, so k is lonely if k <14, but let's check k=14.Wait, k=14 is not lonely because ℓ=14 works. So, k=14 is not lonely. So, the lonely integers are k=1,2,...,13.Wait, but let me test k=7.For k=7:(k +14)/2 = 21/2=10.52k -14=14 -14=0So, ℓ must satisfy 10.5 ≤ ℓ ≤0, which is impossible. So, k=7 is lonely.Similarly, k=13:(k +14)/2=27/2=13.52k -14=26 -14=12So, ℓ must be between 13.5 and 12, which is impossible. So, k=13 is lonely.Similarly, k=14 is not lonely.So, seems like all integers from 1 to 13 inclusive are lonely.But wait, let me check k=14.5 is not an integer, so k must be integer.Wait, but let's think about k=14. Is there any ℓ that works?Yes, ℓ=14, as we saw earlier. So, k=14 is not lonely.Similarly, k=15, ℓ=15 or 16 works.So, the lonely integers are 1 through 13.Therefore, the sum is 1+2+3+...+13.The formula for the sum of the first n integers is n(n+1)/2. So, 13*14/2=91.So, the sum of all lonely integers is 91.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. Is k=14 not lonely? Because (14,14) is compatible.But what about k=14 and ℓ=15? Let's check.Is (14,15) compatible?Check both conditions:14 ≥ (1/2)*15 +7 =7.5 +7=14.5But 14 is not ≥14.5, so that fails.Similarly, 15 ≥ (1/2)*14 +7=7 +7=14, which is true.But since one condition fails, the pair is not compatible.Wait, so for k=14, the only ℓ that works is ℓ=14.Similarly, for k=14, if ℓ=14, then both conditions are satisfied:14 ≥ (1/2)*14 +7=7 +7=14, which is true.And 14 ≥ (1/2)*14 +7=14, which is also true.So, (14,14) is compatible, so k=14 is not lonely.Similarly, for k=15, ℓ=15 and ℓ=16 work.So, indeed, the lonely integers are 1 through 13.Therefore, the sum is 91.But wait, let me check k=13 again.For k=13, is there any ℓ such that (13, ℓ) is compatible?Compute (13 +14)/2=27/2=13.5And 2*13 -14=26 -14=12So, ℓ must be between 13.5 and 12, which is impossible. So, no ℓ satisfies both inequalities. So, k=13 is lonely.Similarly, k=14 is not lonely because ℓ=14 works.Therefore, the lonely integers are 1,2,...,13.Thus, the sum is 1+2+...+13=91.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**boxed{91}"},{"question":"Place three balls, labeled A, B, and C, randomly into four boxes numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. The total number of different ways the balls can be arranged such that there is at least one ball in box number 1 is ___.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to place three balls, labeled A, B, and C, randomly into four boxes numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. The question is asking for the total number of different ways the balls can be arranged such that there is at least one ball in box number 1. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I think it's helpful to understand the total number of possible arrangements without any restrictions. Since each ball can go into any of the four boxes, and the balls are labeled, meaning each is distinct, the number of ways to place each ball is independent of the others. So for each ball, there are four choices. Let me write that down. For ball A, there are 4 options (boxes 1, 2, 3, 4). Similarly, for ball B, there are also 4 options, and the same goes for ball C. So the total number of arrangements is 4 multiplied by itself three times, which is 4^3. Let me calculate that: 4 × 4 is 16, and 16 × 4 is 64. So there are 64 possible ways to arrange the three balls into the four boxes without any restrictions.Now, the problem is asking for the number of arrangements where there's at least one ball in box number 1. Hmm, \\"at least one\\" can sometimes be tricky because it includes one, two, or all three balls in box 1. Instead of calculating each of these scenarios separately, which might be more complicated, I remember that sometimes it's easier to calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions and then subtract the number of arrangements where the condition is not met. In this case, the condition is having at least one ball in box 1, so the opposite would be having no balls in box 1.That makes sense. So, if I can find the number of ways where none of the balls are in box 1, I can subtract that from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where at least one ball is in box 1.Alright, so let's calculate the number of arrangements where no balls are in box 1. If box 1 is off-limits, each ball can only go into boxes 2, 3, or 4. That's three choices per ball. So, similar to before, for each of the three balls, there are 3 options. So the number of such arrangements is 3^3. Let me compute that: 3 × 3 is 9, and 9 × 3 is 27. So there are 27 ways where none of the balls are in box 1.Therefore, the number of arrangements where at least one ball is in box 1 is the total number of arrangements minus the number of arrangements where no balls are in box 1. That would be 64 - 27. Let me do that subtraction: 64 minus 27 is 37. So, is 37 the answer? Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.Wait, 4^3 is 64, and 3^3 is 27. 64 minus 27 is indeed 37. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to double-check, maybe I can approach this problem from another angle to confirm.Another way to think about it is to calculate the number of arrangements where exactly one ball is in box 1, exactly two balls are in box 1, and exactly three balls are in box 1, and then add those numbers together. Let's try that.First, exactly one ball in box 1. There are three balls, so I need to choose which one goes into box 1. The number of ways to choose one ball out of three is given by the combination formula C(3,1), which is 3. Then, the remaining two balls need to go into the other three boxes (2, 3, 4). Each of these two balls has three choices, so that's 3^2, which is 9. So the number of arrangements for exactly one ball in box 1 is 3 × 9 = 27.Next, exactly two balls in box 1. Again, we choose two balls out of three to place in box 1. The number of ways to do this is C(3,2), which is 3. The remaining one ball can go into any of the other three boxes, so that's 3 choices. So the number of arrangements here is 3 × 3 = 9.Lastly, exactly three balls in box 1. There's only one way to choose all three balls, which is C(3,3) = 1. All three balls are in box 1, so there's only one arrangement for this case.Now, adding these up: 27 (for one ball) + 9 (for two balls) + 1 (for three balls) equals 37. So that confirms the previous result. Therefore, the number of arrangements where at least one ball is in box 1 is 37.But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using permutations or something else. Hmm, since the balls are labeled, the order matters, so it's a permutation problem with repetition allowed because multiple balls can go into the same box.Wait, actually, in this case, each ball is being placed independently, so it's more about functions from the set of balls to the set of boxes. Each ball is an element in the domain, and each box is an element in the codomain. So the total number of functions is 4^3, which is 64, as I calculated earlier.The number of functions where box 1 is not mapped to by any ball is 3^3, which is 27, as each ball can only go to boxes 2, 3, or 4. So the number of functions where at least one ball maps to box 1 is 64 - 27 = 37. Yep, same answer.Alternatively, if I think about it using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but in this case, since we're dealing with only one condition (at least one ball in box 1), it's straightforward. If there were more conditions, inclusion-exclusion would come into play, but here it's just total minus the unwanted cases.Wait, another thought: could I have miscounted the number of arrangements where no balls are in box 1? Let me see. If each ball has three choices (boxes 2, 3, 4), then for each ball, 3 options, so 3 × 3 × 3 is 27. That seems correct. So 64 - 27 is indeed 37.Is there a way this could be 36 instead? Hmm, maybe if I considered something else, but I don't think so. Let me recount: 4 boxes, 3 balls. Each ball has 4 choices, so 4 × 4 × 4 is 64. If we exclude box 1, each ball has 3 choices, so 3 × 3 × 3 is 27. 64 - 27 is 37. Yeah, that seems consistent.Wait, maybe I should think about it as assigning each ball to a box, and ensuring that box 1 is not empty. So, for each ball, the probability that it's not in box 1 is 3/4, but that's probability, not counting. But in terms of counting, it's similar: the number of ways where none are in box 1 is 3^3, so 27.Alternatively, if I think about it as arranging the balls with constraints, but I don't think that's necessary here because the straightforward method seems solid.Another angle: suppose I fix one ball in box 1 and then arrange the others. So, for example, fix ball A in box 1, then balls B and C can go anywhere. That would be 1 × 4 × 4 = 16. Similarly, fix ball B in box 1, and balls A and C can go anywhere: another 16. Fix ball C in box 1, and balls A and B can go anywhere: another 16. So that's 16 × 3 = 48. But wait, that counts some arrangements multiple times. For example, if both A and B are in box 1, that arrangement is counted once when we fix A and once when we fix B. Similarly, if all three are in box 1, that's counted three times.So, to correct for overcounting, we need to subtract the overlaps. So, using inclusion-exclusion, the total number is:Number of arrangements with A in 1 + Number with B in 1 + Number with C in 1 - Number with A and B in 1 - Number with A and C in 1 - Number with B and C in 1 + Number with A, B, and C in 1.Calculating each term:- Number with A in 1: 1 × 4 × 4 = 16- Similarly, Number with B in 1: 16- Number with C in 1: 16So, 16 + 16 + 16 = 48Now, subtract the overlaps:- Number with A and B in 1: 1 × 1 × 4 = 4 (since A and B are fixed in 1, C can go anywhere)- Similarly, Number with A and C in 1: 4- Number with B and C in 1: 4So, subtract 4 + 4 + 4 = 12Now, add back the number where all three are in 1, which is 1.So total is 48 - 12 + 1 = 37.Ah, so that also gives 37. So that's another way to get the same answer, using inclusion-exclusion. So that confirms it again.Therefore, I feel confident that the answer is 37.But just to recap, the steps were:1. Calculate total number of arrangements: 4^3 = 642. Calculate number of arrangements where no balls are in box 1: 3^3 = 273. Subtract the two: 64 - 27 = 37Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion:1. Add arrangements where each ball is in box 1: 16 × 3 = 482. Subtract arrangements where two balls are in box 1: 4 × 3 = 123. Add back arrangements where all three are in box 1: 14. Total: 48 - 12 + 1 = 37Both methods lead to 37, so that must be the correct answer.I think I've considered multiple approaches and each time arrived at 37, so I don't see any reason to doubt this result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure that the answer is consistent.So, in conclusion, the total number of different ways the balls can be arranged such that there is at least one ball in box number 1 is 37.**Final Answer**The total number of different ways is boxed{37}."},{"question":"When (2x^2) is added to the quadratic polynomial (f(x)), its maximum value increases by 10. When (5x^2) is subtracted from it, its maximum value decreases by (frac{15}{2}). How will the maximum value of (f(x)) change if (3x^2) is added to it?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a quadratic polynomial f(x). The problem says that when 2x² is added to f(x), its maximum value increases by 10. Then, when 5x² is subtracted from f(x), its maximum value decreases by 15/2. I need to figure out how the maximum value of f(x) changes if 3x² is added to it.First, I remember that a quadratic polynomial has the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Since it's quadratic, its graph is a parabola, and because the problem mentions a maximum value, the parabola must open downward. That means the coefficient of x², which is 'a', must be negative.The maximum value of a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c occurs at x = -b/(2a). The maximum value itself is f(-b/(2a)). Let me write that down:Maximum value of f(x) is f(-b/(2a)) = a*(-b/(2a))² + b*(-b/(2a)) + c.Let me compute that:First, square the term: (-b/(2a))² = b²/(4a²).Multiply by a: a*(b²/(4a²)) = b²/(4a).Then, the second term: b*(-b/(2a)) = -b²/(2a).So, adding these together and the constant term c:Maximum value = b²/(4a) - b²/(2a) + c.Combine the terms:b²/(4a) - 2b²/(4a) = -b²/(4a). So, maximum value is -b²/(4a) + c.So, maximum value of f(x) is c - b²/(4a).Let me denote this maximum value as M. So, M = c - b²/(4a).Now, the problem says that when 2x² is added to f(x), the maximum value increases by 10. Let's write the new function:f(x) + 2x² = (a + 2)x² + bx + c.Similarly, the maximum value of this new function is:M1 = c - b²/(4(a + 2)).According to the problem, M1 = M + 10.So, c - b²/(4(a + 2)) = c - b²/(4a) + 10.Let me write that equation:c - b²/(4(a + 2)) = c - b²/(4a) + 10.Subtract c from both sides:- b²/(4(a + 2)) = - b²/(4a) + 10.Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:- b²/(a + 2) = - b²/a + 40.Multiply both sides by -1:b²/(a + 2) = b²/a - 40.Let me write this as:b²/(a + 2) - b²/a = -40.Factor b²:b² [1/(a + 2) - 1/a] = -40.Compute the difference in the brackets:1/(a + 2) - 1/a = [a - (a + 2)] / [a(a + 2)] = (-2)/(a(a + 2)).So, we have:b² * (-2)/(a(a + 2)) = -40.Multiply both sides by -1:b² * 2/(a(a + 2)) = 40.Divide both sides by 2:b²/(a(a + 2)) = 20.Let me note this as equation (1):b²/(a(a + 2)) = 20.Now, moving on to the second part of the problem. When 5x² is subtracted from f(x), the maximum value decreases by 15/2. So, the new function is:f(x) - 5x² = (a - 5)x² + bx + c.The maximum value of this function is:M2 = c - b²/(4(a - 5)).According to the problem, M2 = M - 15/2.So, c - b²/(4(a - 5)) = c - b²/(4a) - 15/2.Subtract c from both sides:- b²/(4(a - 5)) = - b²/(4a) - 15/2.Multiply both sides by 4:- b²/(a - 5) = - b²/a - 30.Multiply both sides by -1:b²/(a - 5) = b²/a + 30.Bring all terms to one side:b²/(a - 5) - b²/a = 30.Factor b²:b² [1/(a - 5) - 1/a] = 30.Compute the difference in the brackets:1/(a - 5) - 1/a = [a - (a - 5)] / [a(a - 5)] = 5 / [a(a - 5)].So, we have:b² * 5 / [a(a - 5)] = 30.Divide both sides by 5:b² / [a(a - 5)] = 6.Let me note this as equation (2):b² / [a(a - 5)] = 6.Now, I have two equations:Equation (1): b²/(a(a + 2)) = 20.Equation (2): b²/(a(a - 5)) = 6.Let me denote b² as k for simplicity. So, k = b².Then, equation (1): k / [a(a + 2)] = 20.Equation (2): k / [a(a - 5)] = 6.So, from equation (1): k = 20a(a + 2).From equation (2): k = 6a(a - 5).Since both equal k, set them equal:20a(a + 2) = 6a(a - 5).Assuming a ≠ 0 (since it's a quadratic), we can divide both sides by a:20(a + 2) = 6(a - 5).Expand both sides:20a + 40 = 6a - 30.Bring all terms to left side:20a + 40 - 6a + 30 = 0.Simplify:14a + 70 = 0.14a = -70.a = -70 / 14 = -5.So, a = -5.Now, substitute a = -5 into equation (1):k = 20*(-5)*(-5 + 2) = 20*(-5)*(-3) = 20*15 = 300.So, k = b² = 300.Therefore, b² = 300.Now, we can find M, the maximum value of f(x):M = c - b²/(4a) = c - 300/(4*(-5)) = c - 300/(-20) = c + 15.So, M = c + 15.But wait, I don't know c yet. Maybe I can find c?Wait, maybe not necessary. The problem doesn't ask for c, it just asks how the maximum value changes when 3x² is added.So, let's consider f(x) + 3x² = (a + 3)x² + bx + c.The maximum value of this new function is:M3 = c - b²/(4(a + 3)).We need to find how much M3 differs from M.So, M3 - M = [c - b²/(4(a + 3))] - [c - b²/(4a)] = - b²/(4(a + 3)) + b²/(4a).Factor out b²/4:= (b²/4)[ -1/(a + 3) + 1/a ].Compute the expression in the brackets:-1/(a + 3) + 1/a = [ -a + (a + 3) ] / [a(a + 3)] = 3 / [a(a + 3)].So, M3 - M = (b²/4)*(3 / [a(a + 3)]) = (3b²)/(4a(a + 3)).We know b² = 300 and a = -5.So, substitute:= (3*300)/(4*(-5)*(-5 + 3)).Compute denominator: (-5)*(-5 + 3) = (-5)*(-2) = 10.So, denominator is 4*10 = 40.Numerator: 3*300 = 900.So, M3 - M = 900 / 40 = 22.5.So, the maximum value increases by 22.5 when 3x² is added.But 22.5 is equal to 45/2. So, the maximum value increases by 45/2.Wait, let me verify that calculation again.Wait, denominator: a(a + 3) = (-5)(-5 + 3) = (-5)(-2) = 10.So, 4a(a + 3) = 4*10 = 40.Numerator: 3b² = 3*300 = 900.So, 900 / 40 = 22.5, which is 45/2.Yes, that's correct.So, the maximum value increases by 45/2.Wait, but let me think again. When we add 3x², which is positive, to f(x), which is a downward opening parabola, adding 3x² would make the parabola steeper downward, so the maximum value should decrease, right?Wait, that contradicts the result. Hmm.Wait, hold on. If f(x) is a downward opening parabola, its maximum is at the vertex. If we add a positive quadratic term, 3x², which is upward opening, so effectively, we are making the parabola less steep downward or more upward? Wait, no.Wait, f(x) is ax² + bx + c with a negative. Adding 3x² would make a + 3. Since a is -5, a + 3 is -2, which is still negative. So, the parabola is still opening downward, but less steeply. So, the maximum value should increase because the parabola is wider, so the vertex is higher.Wait, actually, when a parabola is wider, the maximum value is higher. For example, y = -x² has maximum at 0, but y = -0.5x² has maximum at 0 as well, but it's wider. Wait, actually, no, the maximum is still at the same point, but the value is the same. Wait, no, wait.Wait, no, actually, for f(x) = ax² + bx + c, the maximum value is c - b²/(4a). So, if a becomes less negative, meaning a increases towards zero, then -b²/(4a) becomes less negative, so the maximum value increases.Yes, that makes sense. So, when a increases (becomes less negative), the maximum value increases.So, in our case, when we add 3x², a becomes a + 3 = -5 + 3 = -2. So, a increases from -5 to -2, which is less negative, so the maximum value increases. So, the result of 45/2 is correct.So, the maximum value increases by 45/2.But let me just make sure that my calculation is correct.So, M3 - M = (3b²)/(4a(a + 3)).We have b² = 300, a = -5.So, 3*300 = 900.4a(a + 3) = 4*(-5)*(-5 + 3) = 4*(-5)*(-2) = 4*10 = 40.So, 900 / 40 = 22.5, which is 45/2. So, correct.Therefore, the maximum value increases by 45/2 when 3x² is added.So, the answer is an increase of 45/2.**Final Answer**The maximum value of (f(x)) will increase by boxed{dfrac{45}{2}}."},{"question":"Calculate:<br/>(1)left(-2.8right)-left(-3.6right)+left(-1.5right)-left(+3.6right);<br/>(2)(-frac{5}{6}+frac{1}{3}-frac{3}{4})×(-24).","answer":"To solve the first expression, I will simplify the signs of each term.

If there is exactly one person between person A and person B, then the number of different arrangements is     .","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: There are 5 people standing in a row. If there is exactly one person between person A and person B, then the number of different arrangements is ___. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me visualize the scenario. There are 5 people in a row, and among them are A and B. The condition is that there's exactly one person between A and B. So, A and B can't be next to each other, but they also can't be too far apart. They have to have exactly one person separating them.Let me think about how A and B can be positioned in the row. Since there are 5 positions, let's number them 1 to 5 from left to right. So, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.Now, if A is in position 1, then B has to be in position 3 because there needs to be exactly one person between them. Similarly, if A is in position 2, B would have to be in position 4. If A is in position 3, then B could be in position 1 or 5. Wait, hold on, if A is in position 3, then B could be in position 1 or 5 because both would have exactly one person between them. Similarly, if A is in position 4, B would be in position 2, and if A is in position 5, B would be in position 3.Wait, so let me list all possible positions for A and B:1. A in 1, B in 32. A in 2, B in 43. A in 3, B in 14. A in 3, B in 55. A in 4, B in 26. A in 5, B in 3So, that's 6 possible arrangements for A and B. But wait, hold on, each of these is a distinct arrangement, right? So, for each of these 6 cases, the rest of the people can be arranged in the remaining positions.But hold on, actually, when A is in position 1 and B is in position 3, that's one arrangement, but when A is in position 3 and B is in position 1, that's a different arrangement because A and B have swapped places. Similarly, when A is in position 5 and B is in position 3, that's another arrangement, and when A is in position 3 and B is in position 5, that's another. So, actually, each of these 6 cases is unique.But wait, let me make sure. So, for each pair of positions where A and B can be placed with exactly one person between them, there are two possibilities: A on the left and B on the right, or B on the left and A on the right, except when A and B are at the ends.Wait, actually, no. For example, if A is in position 1, B has to be in position 3, but B can't be in position -1, so only one possibility there. Similarly, if A is in position 5, B can only be in position 3. But if A is in position 3, B can be in position 1 or 5, so that gives two possibilities.Let me recount:- A in 1: B in 3 (1 possibility)- A in 2: B in 4 (1 possibility)- A in 3: B in 1 or 5 (2 possibilities)- A in 4: B in 2 (1 possibility)- A in 5: B in 3 (1 possibility)So, total possibilities for A and B: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6. So, 6 ways to place A and B with exactly one person between them.Now, once A and B are placed, the remaining 3 people can be arranged in the remaining 3 positions. Since there are 3 people, the number of ways to arrange them is 3 factorial, which is 3! = 6.Therefore, for each of the 6 arrangements of A and B, there are 6 ways to arrange the others. So, total number of arrangements is 6 * 6 = 36.Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as first choosing the positions for A and B, then arranging the rest.So, how many ways are there to choose positions for A and B with exactly one person between them?As we saw earlier, there are 6 possible pairs of positions:(1,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,5), (4,2), (5,3)Wait, but hold on, is (1,3) different from (3,1)? Because in one case A is in 1 and B in 3, and in the other, A is in 3 and B in 1. So, yes, they are different.Therefore, there are 6 possible ordered pairs for (A, B). So, 6 ways.Then, for each of these, the remaining 3 people can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.Therefore, total arrangements: 6 * 6 = 36.Alternatively, another approach: treat A and B as a single unit with one person in between. So, how many such units can we have?Wait, in a row of 5, the possible positions for such a unit (A _ B or B _ A) would be:- Starting at position 1: A _ B in positions 1,2,3- Starting at position 2: A _ B in positions 2,3,4- Starting at position 3: A _ B in positions 3,4,5Similarly, for B _ A:- Starting at position 1: B _ A in positions 1,2,3- Starting at position 2: B _ A in positions 2,3,4- Starting at position 3: B _ A in positions 3,4,5Wait, so that's 3 positions for A _ B and 3 positions for B _ A, totaling 6.Each of these units occupies 3 consecutive positions, but in our case, the condition is exactly one person between A and B, which is two positions apart, not three. Wait, hold on, maybe I confused something here.Wait, if there's exactly one person between A and B, that means A and B are two positions apart, right? So, for example, if A is in position 1, B is in position 3, which is two positions apart, with one person in between.So, in terms of blocks, it's not a block of three, but rather A and B separated by one person.So, the number of ways to place A and B with exactly one person between them is 6, as we calculated earlier.So, perhaps the first approach is correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:First, choose a position for A. There are 5 choices.Once A is placed, B has to be exactly two positions away (either to the left or right), but we have to make sure that B is within the 5 positions.So, for example:- If A is in position 1, B can only be in position 3.- If A is in position 2, B can be in position 4.- If A is in position 3, B can be in position 1 or 5.- If A is in position 4, B can be in position 2.- If A is in position 5, B can be in position 3.So, as we can see, for positions 1,2,4,5, there's only one possible position for B, but for position 3, there are two possible positions for B.Therefore, total number of ways to place A and B is:(4 positions with 1 possibility each) + (1 position with 2 possibilities) = 4 + 2 = 6.So, 6 ways to place A and B.Then, the remaining 3 people can be arranged in the remaining 3 spots in 3! = 6 ways.Therefore, total number of arrangements is 6 * 6 = 36.Wait, so that seems consistent with my earlier reasoning.Alternatively, another way to think about it is:The number of ways to arrange A and B with exactly one person between them is equal to the number of ways to choose two positions for A and B with exactly one space between them, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange A and B in those positions, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the others.So, first, how many such pairs of positions are there?As we saw, the possible pairs are:(1,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,5), (4,2), (5,3)So, 6 pairs.Each pair can be arranged in 2 ways: A first or B first.Wait, no, actually, each pair is an ordered pair. For example, (1,3) is A in 1 and B in 3, while (3,1) is A in 3 and B in 1. So, actually, each of these 6 pairs is unique and already accounts for the order of A and B.Therefore, the number of ways to place A and B is 6.Then, the rest can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.So, total arrangements: 6 * 6 = 36.Alternatively, if I think of it as:First, fix A's position, then B's position is determined based on A's position, then arrange the rest.But that also leads to 6 * 6 = 36.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:Total number of ways to arrange 5 people is 5! = 120.But we have a restriction: exactly one person between A and B.So, how many of these 120 arrangements satisfy the condition?Well, as we calculated, 36.But let me verify that.Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of valid arrangements by considering the possible positions.So, as before, there are 6 possible (A,B) position pairs, each of which can be arranged in 2 ways (A first or B first), but wait, no, actually, each pair is unique in terms of their positions.Wait, no, actually, in the 6 pairs I listed earlier, each pair is unique in terms of the positions and the order of A and B.Wait, for example, (1,3) is A in 1 and B in 3, while (3,1) is A in 3 and B in 1. So, each of these is a distinct arrangement.Therefore, the total number of ways to place A and B is 6.Then, the remaining 3 people can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.Therefore, total arrangements: 6 * 6 = 36.Alternatively, another approach: consider that for A and B to have exactly one person between them, they must be separated by one position. So, in a row of 5, the number of such possible positions is:For A in position 1: B in 3For A in position 2: B in 4For A in position 3: B in 1 or 5For A in position 4: B in 2For A in position 5: B in 3So, that's 6 possibilities for A and B.Each of these 6 possibilities leaves 3 remaining positions for the other 3 people, which can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.Therefore, total arrangements: 6 * 6 = 36.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:The number of ways to choose positions for A and B with exactly one person between them is equal to the number of ways to choose two positions with a distance of 2 apart.In a row of 5, the number of such pairs is:From position 1: can pair with 3From position 2: can pair with 4From position 3: can pair with 1 and 5From position 4: can pair with 2From position 5: can pair with 3So, that's 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 pairs.Each pair can be arranged in 2 ways (A and B or B and A), but wait, no, because when we count the pairs as (1,3), (3,1), etc., we've already considered the order.Wait, actually, no. If we consider unordered pairs, then each pair is counted once, and then we multiply by 2 for the two possible orders.But in our earlier count, we considered ordered pairs, so each pair is unique.Wait, let me clarify.If we consider unordered pairs, meaning that (1,3) is the same as (3,1), then the number of such pairs is:From position 1: 1 pair (1,3)From position 2: 1 pair (2,4)From position 3: 2 pairs (3,1) and (3,5)From position 4: 1 pair (4,2)From position 5: 1 pair (5,3)But wait, that's still 6 pairs, but some are duplicates if we consider unordered.Wait, actually, no. If we consider unordered pairs, the unique pairs are:(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)So, only 3 unique unordered pairs.Each of these can be arranged in 2 ways (A first or B first), so 3 * 2 = 6 ordered pairs.Therefore, the number of ways to place A and B is 6.Then, the rest can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.So, total arrangements: 6 * 6 = 36.Therefore, regardless of whether I think of ordered or unordered pairs, I end up with 6 ways to place A and B, leading to 36 total arrangements.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as:The number of ways to choose two positions for A and B with exactly one person between them is equal to the number of ways to choose a starting position for A such that there's space for B two positions away.In a row of 5, the possible starting positions for A are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.But for each starting position, B has to be two positions away.So:- If A is in 1, B is in 3- If A is in 2, B is in 4- If A is in 3, B can be in 1 or 5- If A is in 4, B is in 2- If A is in 5, B is in 3So, that's 6 possibilities.Each of these 6 possibilities can be arranged in 2 ways (A and B or B and A), but wait, no, because when A is in 1, B is in 3, that's one arrangement, and when A is in 3, B is in 1, that's another arrangement.Wait, but in the above list, when A is in 3, B can be in 1 or 5, which are two separate arrangements.So, actually, the 6 possibilities already account for both orders.Therefore, the number of ways to place A and B is 6.Then, the remaining 3 people can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.So, total arrangements: 6 * 6 = 36.Therefore, I think the answer is 36.Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't overcount or undercount.Another way to think about it is:The total number of ways to arrange 5 people is 5! = 120.Now, the number of ways where A and B have exactly one person between them is equal to the number of ways where the distance between A and B is 2.In permutations, the number of permutations where two specific elements are at a certain distance can be calculated.The formula for the number of permutations of n elements where two specific elements are exactly k positions apart is 2*(n - k - 1)! * (n - 2)! / (n - k - 1)! Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.Wait, actually, the number of ways to arrange n elements where two specific elements are exactly k positions apart is 2*(n - k - 1)! * (n - 2)! / (n - k - 1)! Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.Alternatively, the number of ways to choose positions for A and B with exactly k positions apart is 2*(n - k - 1) choose 1, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of slots.In our case, n = 5, k = 2 (since exactly one person between them means they are two positions apart).So, the number of ways to place A and B with exactly two positions apart is:Number of possible starting positions for A such that B can be placed two positions away.In a row of 5, starting from position 1, A can be in 1,2,3,4,5.But for each A, B has to be two positions away.So, as before:- A in 1: B in 3- A in 2: B in 4- A in 3: B in 1 or 5- A in 4: B in 2- A in 5: B in 3So, that's 6 possibilities.Each of these is a unique arrangement of A and B, and the rest can be arranged freely.Therefore, total arrangements: 6 * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another formula I found online is:Number of permutations of n elements where two specific elements are exactly k apart is 2*(n - k - 1)! * C(n - k, 1). Wait, not sure.Wait, maybe it's better to think that for each valid pair of positions for A and B, there are 2 possibilities (A before B or B before A), except when the positions are symmetric.But in our case, for positions (1,3), (2,4), (3,5), each can be arranged in 2 ways, so 3 pairs * 2 = 6.Wait, but in our earlier count, we had 6 ordered pairs, so that's consistent.Therefore, the number of ways to place A and B is 6, and the rest can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways, so total is 36.Therefore, I think the answer is 36.Wait, just to make sure, let me think of a smaller case.Suppose there are 3 people: A, B, C.If we want exactly one person between A and B, how many arrangements?Positions: 1,2,3.Possible pairs:A in 1, B in 3A in 3, B in 1So, 2 possibilities.Then, the remaining person C can be in the middle position.So, total arrangements:For A in 1, B in 3: C in 2: ABCFor A in 3, B in 1: C in 2: BACSo, total 2 arrangements.Which is 2 * 1! = 2.Similarly, in our case, with 5 people, it's 6 * 3! = 36.So, that seems to scale correctly.Therefore, I think 36 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The number of different arrangements is boxed{36}."},{"question":"Find all positive integers ( M ) less than 10 such that 5 divides ( 1989^M + M^{1989} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem: Find all positive integers ( M ) less than 10 such that 5 divides ( 1989^M + M^{1989} ). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step.First, I know that if 5 divides a number, that number must be congruent to 0 modulo 5. So, essentially, I need to find all ( M ) where ( 1989^M + M^{1989} equiv 0 mod 5 ).Let me start by simplifying ( 1989 ) modulo 5. To do that, I can divide 1989 by 5 and find the remainder. Let me calculate that:1989 divided by 5 is 397 with a remainder of 4. So, ( 1989 equiv 4 mod 5 ). That means ( 1989^M equiv 4^M mod 5 ).So, the expression simplifies to ( 4^M + M^{1989} equiv 0 mod 5 ). Now, I need to evaluate ( 4^M ) and ( M^{1989} ) modulo 5 for each ( M ) from 1 to 9 and see when their sum is 0 modulo 5.Let me list the values of ( M ) from 1 to 9 and compute each part step by step.Starting with ( M = 1 ):- ( 4^1 = 4 mod 5 )- ( 1^{1989} = 1 mod 5 )- Sum: ( 4 + 1 = 5 equiv 0 mod 5 )So, ( M = 1 ) works.Next, ( M = 2 ):- ( 4^2 = 16 equiv 1 mod 5 )- ( 2^{1989} mod 5 ). Hmm, exponentiation modulo 5. I remember that Euler's theorem says that ( a^{phi(n)} equiv 1 mod n ) when ( a ) and ( n ) are coprime. Since 2 and 5 are coprime, ( phi(5) = 4 ), so ( 2^4 equiv 1 mod 5 ). Therefore, ( 2^{1989} = 2^{4*497 + 1} = (2^4)^{497} * 2^1 equiv 1^{497} * 2 = 2 mod 5 )- Sum: ( 1 + 2 = 3 mod 5 ). Not 0, so ( M = 2 ) doesn't work.Moving on to ( M = 3 ):- ( 4^3 = 64 equiv 4 mod 5 ) (since 64 divided by 5 is 12 with remainder 4)- ( 3^{1989} mod 5 ). Again, using Euler's theorem, ( phi(5) = 4 ), so ( 3^4 equiv 1 mod 5 ). Therefore, ( 3^{1989} = 3^{4*497 + 1} = (3^4)^{497} * 3^1 equiv 1^{497} * 3 = 3 mod 5 )- Sum: ( 4 + 3 = 7 equiv 2 mod 5 ). Not 0, so ( M = 3 ) doesn't work.Now, ( M = 4 ):- ( 4^4 = 256 equiv 1 mod 5 ) (since 256 divided by 5 is 51 with remainder 1)- ( 4^{1989} mod 5 ). Wait, since ( 4 equiv -1 mod 5 ), so ( 4^{1989} equiv (-1)^{1989} = -1 mod 5 )- Sum: ( 1 + (-1) = 0 mod 5 ). Perfect, ( M = 4 ) works.Next, ( M = 5 ):- ( 4^5 = 1024 equiv 4 mod 5 ) (since 1024 divided by 5 is 204 with remainder 4)- ( 5^{1989} mod 5 ). Well, any power of 5 is 0 modulo 5.- Sum: ( 4 + 0 = 4 mod 5 ). Not 0, so ( M = 5 ) doesn't work.Moving to ( M = 6 ):- ( 4^6 = 4096 equiv 1 mod 5 ) (since 4096 divided by 5 is 819 with remainder 1)- ( 6^{1989} mod 5 ). Since 6 is congruent to 1 modulo 5, ( 6^{1989} equiv 1^{1989} = 1 mod 5 )- Sum: ( 1 + 1 = 2 mod 5 ). Not 0, so ( M = 6 ) doesn't work.Next, ( M = 7 ):- ( 4^7 = 16384 equiv 4 mod 5 ) (since 16384 divided by 5 is 3276 with remainder 4)- ( 7^{1989} mod 5 ). 7 is congruent to 2 modulo 5, so ( 7^{1989} equiv 2^{1989} mod 5 ). Earlier, I saw that ( 2^4 equiv 1 mod 5 ), so ( 2^{1989} = 2^{4*497 + 1} equiv 1^{497} * 2 = 2 mod 5 )- Sum: ( 4 + 2 = 6 equiv 1 mod 5 ). Not 0, so ( M = 7 ) doesn't work.Now, ( M = 8 ):- ( 4^8 = 65536 equiv 1 mod 5 ) (since 65536 divided by 5 is 13107 with remainder 1)- ( 8^{1989} mod 5 ). 8 is congruent to 3 modulo 5, so ( 8^{1989} equiv 3^{1989} mod 5 ). Again, using Euler's theorem, ( 3^4 equiv 1 mod 5 ), so ( 3^{1989} = 3^{4*497 + 1} equiv 1^{497} * 3 = 3 mod 5 )- Sum: ( 1 + 3 = 4 mod 5 ). Not 0, so ( M = 8 ) doesn't work.Finally, ( M = 9 ):- ( 4^9 = 262144 equiv 4 mod 5 ) (since 262144 divided by 5 is 52428 with remainder 4)- ( 9^{1989} mod 5 ). 9 is congruent to 4 modulo 5, so ( 9^{1989} equiv 4^{1989} mod 5 ). Since ( 4 equiv -1 mod 5 ), ( 4^{1989} equiv (-1)^{1989} = -1 mod 5 )- Sum: ( 4 + (-1) = 3 mod 5 ). Not 0, so ( M = 9 ) doesn't work.So, after checking each ( M ) from 1 to 9, the values that satisfy the condition are ( M = 1 ) and ( M = 4 ).Wait, let me just double-check my calculations for ( M = 4 ) because sometimes I might make a mistake with exponents.For ( M = 4 ):- ( 4^4 = 256 equiv 1 mod 5 ) is correct.- ( 4^{1989} mod 5 ). Since ( 4 equiv -1 mod 5 ), ( (-1)^{1989} = -1 mod 5 ) because 1989 is odd. So, ( 4^{1989} equiv -1 mod 5 ). Therefore, ( 1 + (-1) = 0 mod 5 ). Yep, that's correct.And for ( M = 1 ):- ( 4^1 = 4 mod 5 ) and ( 1^{1989} = 1 mod 5 ). So, 4 + 1 = 5, which is 0 mod 5. That's also correct.I think I covered all cases. So, the positive integers ( M ) less than 10 that satisfy the condition are 1 and 4.**Final Answer**The positive integers ( M ) are boxed{1} and boxed{4}."},{"question":"Given that dfrac {2+cot ^{2}θ}{1+sin θ}=1, find the value of (1+sin θ)(2+cos θ)= _____ .","answer":"Okay, so I've got this equation: (2 + cot²θ)/(1 + sinθ) = 1, and I need to find the value of (1 + sinθ)(2 + cosθ). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down the given equation:(2 + cot²θ)/(1 + sinθ) = 1I need to solve for θ or maybe find some relationship between sinθ and cosθ that can help me compute the expression (1 + sinθ)(2 + cosθ). Let's see.Since cotθ is cosθ/sinθ, maybe I can express everything in terms of sinθ or cosθ. Let me try that.So, cot²θ is (cos²θ)/(sin²θ). Let's substitute that into the equation:(2 + (cos²θ)/(sin²θ))/(1 + sinθ) = 1Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can multiply numerator and denominator by sin²θ to eliminate the fraction in the numerator. Let's try that:[2sin²θ + cos²θ] / [sin²θ(1 + sinθ)] = 1So now the equation becomes:[2sin²θ + cos²θ] = sin²θ(1 + sinθ)Let me write that out:2sin²θ + cos²θ = sin²θ(1 + sinθ)Hmm, let's expand the right side:sin²θ + sin³θSo now, the equation is:2sin²θ + cos²θ = sin²θ + sin³θLet me bring all terms to one side:2sin²θ + cos²θ - sin²θ - sin³θ = 0Simplify:(2sin²θ - sin²θ) + cos²θ - sin³θ = 0Which is:sin²θ + cos²θ - sin³θ = 0Wait, I remember that sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so let's substitute that:1 - sin³θ = 0So, 1 = sin³θTherefore, sinθ = 1, since 1 is the real cube root of 1.So, sinθ = 1. That means θ is π/2 + 2πk, where k is an integer. But since trigonometric functions are periodic, we can just take θ = π/2.Now, let's compute the expression (1 + sinθ)(2 + cosθ). Since sinθ = 1, let's find cosθ.We know that sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, so cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ = 1 - 1 = 0. Therefore, cosθ = 0.So, cosθ = 0.Now, plug into (1 + sinθ)(2 + cosθ):(1 + 1)(2 + 0) = (2)(2) = 4So, the value is 4.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with (2 + cot²θ)/(1 + sinθ) = 1.Expressed in terms of sinθ and cosθ, that becomes [2 + (cos²θ)/(sin²θ)]/(1 + sinθ) = 1.Multiply numerator and denominator by sin²θ: [2sin²θ + cos²θ]/[sin²θ(1 + sinθ)] = 1.So, 2sin²θ + cos²θ = sin²θ(1 + sinθ).Expanding the right side: sin²θ + sin³θ.Bringing everything to the left: 2sin²θ + cos²θ - sin²θ - sin³θ = 0.Simplify: sin²θ + cos²θ - sin³θ = 0.Since sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, we have 1 - sin³θ = 0 => sin³θ = 1 => sinθ = 1.Therefore, θ = π/2 + 2πk, so sinθ = 1, cosθ = 0.Thus, (1 + sinθ)(2 + cosθ) = (1 + 1)(2 + 0) = 2*2 = 4.Yes, that seems correct. So, the value is 4.**Final Answer**boxed{4}"},{"question":"In the polar coordinate system, find the distance from the point (2,frac{pi}{2}) to the line rhocostheta=1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the distance from the point (2, π/2) in polar coordinates to the line given by ρcosθ = 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in polar coordinates, a point is represented as (ρ, θ), where ρ is the distance from the origin and θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. So, the point (2, π/2) should be 2 units away from the origin at an angle of π/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. That would place it on the positive y-axis, right? So, in Cartesian coordinates, that point would be (0, 2). Let me confirm that: x = ρcosθ = 2cos(π/2) = 0, and y = ρsinθ = 2sin(π/2) = 2. Yep, so it's (0, 2).Now, the line is given by ρcosθ = 1. I think that's a polar equation of a line. I remember that in polar coordinates, the equation ρcosθ = a represents a vertical line at x = a. Let me verify that. If I convert ρcosθ = 1 to Cartesian coordinates, since x = ρcosθ, it becomes x = 1. So, yes, it's a vertical line crossing the x-axis at 1.So, now the problem simplifies to finding the distance from the point (0, 2) to the line x = 1. That seems straightforward. In Cartesian coordinates, the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is given by |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). But in this case, the line is x = 1, which can be written as 1x + 0y - 1 = 0. So, a = 1, b = 0, c = -1.Plugging the point (0, 2) into the formula: |1*0 + 0*2 - 1| / sqrt(1² + 0²) = | -1 | / 1 = 1. So, the distance is 1. Hmm, that seems too simple. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps.Wait, another way to think about it is that the line x = 1 is a vertical line, and the point (0, 2) is on the y-axis. The horizontal distance between them is just the difference in the x-coordinates, which is |0 - 1| = 1. So, that confirms it. The distance is indeed 1.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the polar coordinates, let me go through the conversion again. The point (2, π/2) in polar is (0, 2) in Cartesian. The line ρcosθ = 1 is x = 1. The distance from (0, 2) to x = 1 is 1. Yep, that all checks out.Alternatively, I could have approached this problem without converting to Cartesian coordinates. I remember that in polar coordinates, the distance from a point (ρ, θ) to a line given by ρcos(θ - α) = d can be found using some formula, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should derive it.Wait, the general equation of a line in polar coordinates can be written as ρ = e / (cos(θ - φ)), where e is the distance from the origin to the line, and φ is the angle that the perpendicular from the origin to the line makes with the x-axis. But in this case, the line is given as ρcosθ = 1. Comparing that to the general form, it seems that φ is 0 because there's no angle shift. So, the line is at a distance of 1 from the origin along the x-axis.So, the distance from the origin to the line is 1. Now, the point is (2, π/2), which is 2 units away from the origin along the y-axis. So, the distance from the point to the line can be found using the formula for the distance between two points in polar coordinates, but adjusted for one being a line.Wait, actually, maybe I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line in polar coordinates. Let me recall. If the line is given by ρcos(θ - α) = p, where p is the distance from the origin to the line, and α is the angle of the perpendicular from the origin to the line. Then, the distance from a point (r, θ) to this line is |r cos(θ - α) - p|.Is that correct? Let me check. If I have a line ρcos(θ - α) = p, then the distance from a point (r, θ) to this line is |r cos(θ - α) - p|. Hmm, that seems plausible.In our case, the line is ρcosθ = 1, which can be written as ρcos(θ - 0) = 1. So, α = 0 and p = 1. The point is (2, π/2). So, plugging into the formula: |2 cos(π/2 - 0) - 1| = |2 cos(π/2) - 1| = |2*0 - 1| = | -1 | = 1. So, same result.Therefore, whether I convert to Cartesian coordinates or use the polar formula, I get the distance as 1. That seems consistent.Just to recap, the steps I took were:1. Convert the polar point (2, π/2) to Cartesian coordinates, which gave me (0, 2).2. Recognize that the line ρcosθ = 1 is equivalent to x = 1 in Cartesian coordinates.3. Calculate the distance from (0, 2) to x = 1, which is 1 unit.4. As a check, use the polar coordinate formula for the distance from a point to a line, which also gave me 1.Therefore, I'm confident that the distance is 1.**Final Answer**The distance from the point to the line is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Let ( M = {u mid u = 12m + 8n + 4l }, text{where } m, n, l in mathbb{Z} } ) and ( N = {u mid u = 20p + 16q + 12r }, text{where } p, q, r in mathbb{Z} } ). Determine the relationship between sets ( M ) and ( N ):A. ( M = N )B. ( M nsubseteq N, N nsubseteq M )C. ( M varsubsetneqq N )D. ( M supsetneqq N )","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out the relationship between two sets, M and N. Both sets are defined as the set of all integers that can be expressed as linear combinations of certain numbers with integer coefficients. Specifically, M is the set of all integers of the form 12m + 8n + 4l where m, n, l are integers, and N is the set of all integers of the form 20p + 16q + 12r where p, q, r are integers. The question is asking whether M equals N, or if one is a subset of the other, or if neither is a subset of the other. The options are A, B, C, D, corresponding to these possibilities.First, I remember that when dealing with sets defined by linear combinations with integer coefficients, these sets are essentially the ideals generated by the coefficients in the ring of integers. In the integers, every ideal is principal, meaning it can be generated by a single element, which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the generators. So, for set M, which is generated by 12, 8, and 4, I can find the gcd of these numbers, and similarly for set N, which is generated by 20, 16, and 12.Let me start with set M. The numbers are 12, 8, and 4. I need to find gcd(12, 8, 4). I know that gcd(12, 8) is 4, since 12 and 8 are both divisible by 4, and 4 is the largest such number. Then, gcd(4, 4) is still 4. So, the gcd of 12, 8, and 4 is 4. That means set M is equal to all multiples of 4, right? Because any linear combination of 12, 8, and 4 with integer coefficients will be a multiple of 4, and conversely, any multiple of 4 can be expressed as such a combination. For example, 4 itself can be obtained by setting m=0, n=0, l=1. Similarly, 8 can be obtained by m=0, n=1, l=0, and so on.Now, moving on to set N. The generators here are 20, 16, and 12. I need to find gcd(20, 16, 12). Let me compute this step by step. First, find gcd(20, 16). The divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, and the divisors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. The common divisors are 1, 2, 4, so the gcd is 4. Then, I need to find gcd(4, 12). The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4, and the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The common divisors are 1, 2, 4, so the gcd is 4. Therefore, the gcd of 20, 16, and 12 is also 4. That means set N is also equal to all multiples of 4.Wait, so both M and N are equal to the set of all multiples of 4? That would mean that M equals N, right? So, the answer should be A. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.For set M, since the generators are 12, 8, and 4, and their gcd is 4, M is indeed the set of all multiples of 4. Similarly, for set N, the generators are 20, 16, and 12, and their gcd is also 4, so N is the set of all multiples of 4. Therefore, M and N are the same set.But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should check if every element of M is in N and vice versa. Let's take an element from M, say 4. Is 4 in N? Yes, because N is the set of all multiples of 4, so 4 is in N. Similarly, take 8 from M. Is 8 in N? Yes, because 8 is a multiple of 4. How about 12? 12 is in both M and N. Similarly, take a larger multiple, say 20. Is 20 in M? Yes, because 20 is 12*1 + 8*1 + 4*0, so 20 is in M. Similarly, 20 is in N because it's a generator of N. So, it seems like every element of M is in N and every element of N is in M. Therefore, M equals N.But just to be extra careful, let me think about whether there could be any elements in M that aren't in N or vice versa. Since both sets are defined as all multiples of 4, any multiple of 4 can be expressed as a linear combination of the generators for both sets. For example, take 4k where k is an integer. For M, 4k can be written as 12*0 + 8*0 + 4*k, which is valid. For N, 4k can be written as 20*0 + 16*0 + 12*0 + ... Wait, actually, N is generated by 20, 16, and 12. So, can any multiple of 4 be expressed as a combination of 20, 16, and 12? Let's see.Take 4 itself. How can we express 4 as 20p + 16q + 12r? Let me try to find integers p, q, r such that 20p + 16q + 12r = 4. Let's see, maybe set p=0, q=0, then 12r =4. But 12r=4 implies r=4/12=1/3, which is not an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe another approach. Let's try p=1, then 20*1 + 16q + 12r = 4 => 20 + 16q + 12r =4 => 16q + 12r = -16. Let's see, can we find integers q and r such that 16q + 12r = -16? Let's factor out 4: 4*(4q + 3r) = -16 => 4q + 3r = -4. Let's solve for integers q and r. Let me set q=1, then 4*1 + 3r = -4 => 3r = -8 => r= -8/3, not integer. q= -1: 4*(-1) + 3r = -4 => -4 + 3r = -4 => 3r=0 => r=0. So, q=-1, r=0. Therefore, p=1, q=-1, r=0. So, 20*1 + 16*(-1) + 12*0 = 20 -16 =4. So, yes, 4 is in N. Similarly, 8 can be expressed as 20*0 + 16*1 + 12*0 =16, which is not 8. Wait, that's 16. Hmm, maybe another combination. Let's try p=0, q=0, r= something. 20*0 +16*0 +12*r=8 =>12r=8 => r=8/12=2/3, not integer. Alternatively, p=1, q= something, r= something. Let's try p=1: 20 +16q +12r=8 =>16q +12r= -12. Factor out 4: 4*(4q + 3r)= -12 =>4q +3r= -3. Let me set q=0: 3r= -3 => r= -1. So, p=1, q=0, r=-1. Then, 20*1 +16*0 +12*(-1)=20 -12=8. So, yes, 8 is in N.Similarly, let's check 12. 12 is a generator of N, so 12 is in N. Similarly, 16 is a generator of N, so 16 is in N. 20 is a generator of N, so 20 is in N. So, all the generators of M are in N, which suggests that M is a subset of N. But wait, earlier I thought both sets are equal because their gcds are the same. But just to confirm, let's see if N is a subset of M.Take an element of N, say 20. Is 20 in M? Yes, because 20 can be expressed as 12*1 +8*1 +4*0=20. Similarly, 16 is in M: 12*0 +8*2 +4*0=16. 12 is in M: 12*1 +8*0 +4*0=12. So, all generators of N are in M, which suggests N is a subset of M. Therefore, since M is a subset of N and N is a subset of M, they must be equal.Wait, but earlier when I tried to express 4 as a combination of N's generators, I had to use p=1, q=-1, r=0, which worked. Similarly, 8 required p=1, q=0, r=-1. So, it's possible, but it's not as straightforward as just setting one coefficient to 1 and the others to 0. But since it's possible, it means that every multiple of 4 is in both sets.Therefore, the sets M and N are equal. So, the answer should be A.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the gcds. For M: 12, 8, 4. The gcd is 4, correct. For N: 20, 16, 12. The gcd is 4, correct. So, both sets are equal to 4Z, the set of all multiples of 4. Therefore, M=N.I think that's solid. So, the answer is A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"The rules of a musical instrument competition state that the preliminary round consists of four rounds, and the average score of the four rounds must be no less than 96 points to advance to the finals.

Will the product of these modified numbers be greater or smaller compared to the product of the original numbers?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are three positive numbers. Each of them is changed in a certain way: the first one is increased by 10%, the second by 13%, and the third one is decreased by 20%. I need to figure out whether the product of these modified numbers will be greater or smaller compared to the product of the original numbers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me denote the original three numbers as ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). So, their original product is ( a times b times c ). Now, each of these numbers is modified:- The first number ( a ) is increased by 10%. That means the new value of ( a ) is ( a + 10% ) of ( a ), which is ( a times 1.10 ).- The second number ( b ) is increased by 13%. Similarly, the new value of ( b ) is ( b times 1.13 ).- The third number ( c ) is decreased by 20%. So, the new value of ( c ) is ( c - 20% ) of ( c ), which is ( c times 0.80 ).So, the modified numbers are ( 1.10a ), ( 1.13b ), and ( 0.80c ). The product of these modified numbers will be ( 1.10a times 1.13b times 0.80c ).Let me compute the product of the factors first: 1.10, 1.13, and 0.80. If I multiply these together, I can find out the overall scaling factor applied to the original product ( abc ).Calculating step by step:First, multiply 1.10 and 1.13. Let me do that:1.10 multiplied by 1.13. Hmm, 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.13 is 0.13, 0.10 times 1 is 0.10, and 0.10 times 0.13 is 0.013. Adding all these up: 1 + 0.13 + 0.10 + 0.013 = 1.243. Wait, is that right? Let me check:Alternatively, 1.10 * 1.13 can be calculated as:1.10x1.13--------Multiply 1.10 by 3: 3.30Multiply 1.10 by 10: 11.00 (but shifted one position to the left)Multiply 1.10 by 1 (hundreds place): 1.10 (shifted two positions to the left)Adding them up: 3.30 + 11.00 + 110.00 = 124.30. Wait, that can't be right because 1.10 * 1.13 is less than 2. Maybe I messed up the decimal places.Wait, no, actually, when multiplying decimals, the number of decimal places in the result is the sum of the decimal places in the factors. 1.10 has two decimal places, 1.13 has two decimal places, so the product should have four decimal places. But when I did the multiplication step by step, I think I misplaced the decimals.Let me try another method. 1.10 is the same as 11/10, and 1.13 is 113/100. So multiplying them together: (11/10) * (113/100) = (11*113)/(10*100) = 1243/1000 = 1.243. Okay, that matches my initial calculation. So 1.10 * 1.13 = 1.243.Now, multiply this result by 0.80. So, 1.243 * 0.80. Let me compute that.1.243 * 0.80. Let's break it down:1 * 0.80 = 0.800.2 * 0.80 = 0.160.04 * 0.80 = 0.0320.003 * 0.80 = 0.0024Adding these up: 0.80 + 0.16 = 0.96; 0.96 + 0.032 = 0.992; 0.992 + 0.0024 = 0.9944.So, 1.243 * 0.80 = 0.9944.Therefore, the overall scaling factor is 0.9944. That means the product of the modified numbers is 0.9944 times the original product.Since 0.9944 is less than 1, the product of the modified numbers is smaller than the original product.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the multiplication once again.First, 1.10 * 1.13:1.10x1.13--------Multiply 1.10 by 3: 3.30Multiply 1.10 by 1 (tens place): 11.00Multiply 1.10 by 1 (hundreds place): 110.00But wait, actually, when multiplying by 1.13, it's 1.10 * 3 (hundredths place) + 1.10 * 1 (tenths place) + 1.10 * 1 (units place). Wait, no, that's not the standard way. Let me think.Actually, 1.13 is 1 + 0.1 + 0.03. So, 1.10*(1 + 0.1 + 0.03) = 1.10 + 0.11 + 0.033 = 1.243. Yeah, that's correct.Then, 1.243 * 0.80:1.243 * 0.8 = (1 * 0.8) + (0.2 * 0.8) + (0.04 * 0.8) + (0.003 * 0.8) = 0.8 + 0.16 + 0.032 + 0.0024 = 0.9944. Correct.So, the scaling factor is 0.9944, which is approximately 0.9944, which is just slightly less than 1. So, the product is decreased by about 0.56%.Therefore, the product of the modified numbers is smaller than the original product.Alternatively, I can think of it as the overall percentage change. The first number increases by 10%, the second by 13%, and the third decreases by 20%. To find the overall percentage change in the product, we can add the percentage changes, but actually, percentage changes in multiplication don't add linearly. Instead, the overall effect is multiplicative.So, another way to think about it is:The first number becomes 110% of its original value, the second becomes 113%, and the third becomes 80%. So, the overall factor is 1.10 * 1.13 * 0.80, which is exactly what I calculated earlier, resulting in 0.9944, which is a decrease of approximately 0.56%.So, regardless of the original numbers, as long as they are positive, the product will decrease by about 0.56%.Therefore, the product of the modified numbers will be smaller than the product of the original numbers.**Final Answer**The product of the modified numbers will be smaller. boxed{text{Smaller}}"},{"question":"Given 99 distinct prime numbers ( p_{1}, p_{2}, cdots p_{99} ), let ( N = p_{1}^{2} + p_{2}^{2} + cdots + p_{99}^{2} ). What is the remainder when ( N ) is divided by 3?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given 99 distinct prime numbers, labeled ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{99} ). I need to find the remainder when the sum of their squares, which is ( N = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + cdots + p_{99}^2 ), is divided by 3. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that when dealing with remainders and divisibility, modular arithmetic is really useful. Since the question is about division by 3, I should probably consider each prime number modulo 3. That is, for each prime ( p_i ), I can find ( p_i mod 3 ), which will give me a remainder of either 0, 1, or 2. Then, since I'm dealing with squares, I can figure out what ( p_i^2 mod 3 ) is for each case.But wait, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, except for the prime number 3, all other primes are either 1 or 2 modulo 3. Because if a prime number is divisible by 3, it must be 3 itself. So, that gives me some structure to work with.Let me break this down:1. **Identify primes modulo 3:**   - The prime number 3 is congruent to 0 modulo 3.   - All other primes are either congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3.2. **Squares modulo 3:**   - If a number is congruent to 0 modulo 3, its square is also 0 modulo 3.   - If a number is congruent to 1 modulo 3, its square is (1^2 = 1) modulo 3.   - If a number is congruent to 2 modulo 3, its square is (2^2 = 4), which is congruent to 1 modulo 3.So, putting this together, for any prime number ( p ):- If ( p = 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 0 mod 3 ).- If ( p neq 3 ), then ( p^2 equiv 1 mod 3 ).That's a helpful result. So, each prime squared is either 0 or 1 modulo 3, depending on whether it's 3 or another prime.Now, in our problem, we have 99 distinct primes. Since 3 is a prime, it's included in these 99 primes. So, one of the primes is 3, and the remaining 98 primes are other primes, which are either 1 or 2 modulo 3.Therefore, when we square each of these primes and sum them up, the total sum ( N ) modulo 3 will be the sum of 0 (from 3 squared) and 98 instances of 1 (from the other primes squared). So, mathematically, that would be:( N equiv 0 + 98 times 1 mod 3 )Simplifying that, we get:( N equiv 98 mod 3 )Now, I need to compute 98 modulo 3. Let me do that division:3 goes into 98 how many times? Well, 3 times 32 is 96, and 98 minus 96 is 2. So, 98 divided by 3 is 32 with a remainder of 2. Therefore,( 98 equiv 2 mod 3 )So, putting it all together, ( N equiv 2 mod 3 ).Wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, we have 99 primes, one of which is 3. The square of 3 is 9, which is 0 modulo 3. The other 98 primes are not 3, so their squares are each 1 modulo 3. So, 98 times 1 is 98, which is 2 modulo 3. So, the total sum is 2 modulo 3. That seems right.But just to double-check, let me think about another approach. Maybe considering the properties of quadratic residues modulo 3. Quadratic residues are the possible remainders when squares are divided by a number, in this case, 3. The quadratic residues modulo 3 are 0 and 1, because:- (0^2 equiv 0 mod 3)- (1^2 equiv 1 mod 3)- (2^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 mod 3)So, indeed, any square number modulo 3 is either 0 or 1. For primes, except for 3, all others are either 1 or 2 modulo 3, so their squares are 1 modulo 3. So, that reaffirms my earlier conclusion.Therefore, in our case, since we have 99 primes, one of which is 3, contributing 0, and the other 98 contributing 1 each, the total sum modulo 3 is 98 modulo 3, which is 2.So, the remainder when ( N ) is divided by 3 is 2.Wait, hold on again. Let me just verify the arithmetic with 98 divided by 3. 3 times 30 is 90, 3 times 32 is 96, 3 times 33 is 99. So, 98 is 3 times 32 plus 2, so yes, 98 modulo 3 is 2. So, that's correct.Alternatively, I can think of 98 as 90 + 8. 90 is divisible by 3, so 90 modulo 3 is 0. Then, 8 modulo 3 is 2, so 98 modulo 3 is 2. Yep, that's consistent.Therefore, I feel confident that the remainder is 2 when ( N ) is divided by 3.**Final Answer**The remainder when ( N ) is divided by 3 is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Fang, Ming, Ma, and Hong participated in a competition and were asked by a reporter: \\"Which one of you got first place?\\" Fang said, \\"I got first place.\\" Ming said, \\"Hong didn't get first place.\\" Ma said, \\"Ming didn't get first place.\\" Hong said, \\"I got first place.\\" It is known that only one of them is telling the truth, and only one person got first place. Based on the information above, who got first place?(A) Ming(B) Ma(C) Hong(D) Fang","answer":"Alright, so I've got this logic puzzle here, and I need to figure out who got first place in the competition. The participants are Fang, Ming, Ma, and Hong. Each of them made a statement when asked by a reporter who got first place. The catch is that only one of them is telling the truth, and only one person actually got first place. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.First, let me list out the statements each person made:1. Fang said, \\"I got first place.\\"2. Ming said, \\"Hong didn't get first place.\\"3. Ma said, \\"Ming didn't get first place.\\"4. Hong said, \\"I got first place.\\"So, we have four statements, and only one is true. The rest must be false. Also, only one person got first place, so three of them are lying about their claim or their accusation.Let me consider each possibility one by one. Since only one person got first place, let's assume each person could be the winner and see if that leads to only one true statement.**Case 1: Suppose Fang got first place.**- If Fang is telling the truth, then his statement is true.- Let's check the other statements:  - Ming said Hong didn't get first place. If Fang is first, then Hong didn't get first place, so Ming's statement is also true.  - But wait, that would mean both Fang and Ming are telling the truth, which contradicts the condition that only one person is telling the truth. Therefore, Fang cannot be the one who got first place.**Case 2: Suppose Ming got first place.**- If Ming is telling the truth, then his statement \\"Hong didn't get first place\\" is true.- Let's check the other statements:  - Fang said he got first place, which would be false because Ming is first.  - Ma said \\"Ming didn't get first place,\\" which would be false because Ming did get first place.  - Hong said he got first place, which is also false.- So, in this case, only Ming's statement is true, and the rest are false. That fits the condition perfectly. Hmm, so Ming could be the one.But let me check the other cases just to be thorough.**Case 3: Suppose Ma got first place.**- If Ma is telling the truth, then his statement \\"Ming didn't get first place\\" is true.- Let's check the other statements:  - Fang said he got first place, which is false because Ma is first.  - Ming said Hong didn't get first place. Since Ma is first, Hong didn't get first place, so Ming's statement is also true.  - Hong said he got first place, which is false.- So, both Ma and Ming are telling the truth, which again contradicts the condition that only one person is truthful. Therefore, Ma cannot be the one.**Case 4: Suppose Hong got first place.**- If Hong is telling the truth, then his statement \\"I got first place\\" is true.- Let's check the other statements:  - Fang said he got first place, which is false because Hong is first.  - Ming said Hong didn't get first place, which is false because Hong did.  - Ma said \\"Ming didn't get first place,\\" which is true because Hong is first, so Ming didn't get it.- So, both Hong and Ma are telling the truth, which again contradicts the condition. Therefore, Hong cannot be the one.Wait, hold on. In Case 4, if Hong is first, then both Hong and Ma are telling the truth? Let me double-check that.- Hong's statement: \\"I got first place.\\" If Hong is first, this is true.- Ma's statement: \\"Ming didn't get first place.\\" Since Hong is first, Ming didn't get it, so this is also true.- So, two truths here, which violates the condition. So Hong can't be first.So, going back, only in Case 2, when Ming is first, do we have only one true statement. Let me just recap:- If Ming is first:  - Ming's statement is true.  - Fang's statement is false.  - Ma's statement is false.  - Hong's statement is false.  That's exactly one true statement, which fits the condition. Therefore, Ming must be the one who got first place.But just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by assuming each statement is true and seeing if it leads to a contradiction.**Alternative Approach:**1. Assume Fang is telling the truth.   - Then Fang is first.   - But then Ming's statement \\"Hong didn't get first place\\" is also true because Fang is first. Contradiction. So Fang can't be truthful.2. Assume Ming is telling the truth.   - Then Hong didn't get first place.   - Since only one person is telling the truth, Fang, Ma, and Hong must be lying.   - Fang lying means Fang didn't get first place.   - Ma lying means Ming did get first place.   - Hong lying means Hong didn't get first place.   - So, if Ming is telling the truth, then Ming got first place, which is consistent with Ma lying. This seems okay.3. Assume Ma is telling the truth.   - Then Ming didn't get first place.   - Since only one person is truthful, Fang, Ming, and Hong must be lying.   - Fang lying means Fang didn't get first place.   - Ming lying means Hong did get first place.   - Hong lying means Hong didn't get first place.   - Wait, contradiction here. If Ma is truthful, then Ming didn't get first place, so either Fang, Ma, or Hong did. But Fang is lying, so Fang didn't get it. If Hong is lying, then Hong didn't get it, so Ma must have gotten it. But if Ma got it, then Ma is truthful, which is okay, but then Ming's statement \\"Hong didn't get first place\\" is also true because Ma did. So, both Ma and Ming are truthful, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Ma can't be the truthful one.4. Assume Hong is telling the truth.   - Then Hong got first place.   - Since only one person is truthful, Fang, Ming, and Ma must be lying.   - Fang lying means Fang didn't get first place.   - Ming lying means Hong did get first place, which is consistent.   - Ma lying means Ming did get first place, which contradicts Hong getting first place.   - So, contradiction. Therefore, Hong can't be truthful.So, through this alternative approach, only Ming being truthful doesn't lead to a contradiction, which solidifies the conclusion that Ming is the one who got first place.Just to add another layer, let's consider the implications of each person's statement:- Fang and Hong both claim they got first place. If either of them is telling the truth, the other must be lying. But since only one person is telling the truth, if Fang is truthful, Hong is lying, but then Ming's statement would also be true, which isn't allowed. Similarly, if Hong is truthful, Ma's statement would also be true, which isn't allowed. Therefore, neither Fang nor Hong can be the truthful one.- That leaves Ming and Ma. If Ming is truthful, Ma is lying, which is acceptable because Ma's lie would mean Ming did get first place, which is consistent. If Ma is truthful, Ming is lying, but that leads to a contradiction because then both Ma and Ming's statements would have implications that conflict with each other.Therefore, the only consistent scenario is that Ming is the one who got first place, and his statement is the only true one.I think I've covered all the angles here. Each possible winner is considered, and only Ming fits without causing contradictions. So, I'm pretty confident that Ming is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"The side of the base of a regular quadrilateral pyramid is a. A lateral face forms a 45^{circ} angle with the plane of the base. Find the height of the pyramid.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a regular quadrilateral pyramid. The base is a square with side length 'a'. A lateral face forms a 45-degree angle with the plane of the base. I need to find the height of the pyramid. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, a regular quadrilateral pyramid means that the base is a square, and the apex is directly above the center of the base. So, all the lateral edges are equal, and all the lateral faces are congruent isosceles triangles. Each lateral face is a triangle with a base of length 'a' and two equal sides which are the edges from the base to the apex.Now, the problem says that a lateral face forms a 45-degree angle with the plane of the base. So, I need to figure out what exactly this angle refers to. I think it's the dihedral angle between the lateral face and the base. A dihedral angle is the angle between two planes, so in this case, between the lateral face and the base.To find the height of the pyramid, I might need to relate this dihedral angle to the height. Let me recall that the dihedral angle can be found using the angle between the planes, which involves the height of the pyramid and some other dimensions.Let me draw a diagram in my mind. The base is a square with side 'a'. The apex is above the center of the square. If I consider one of the lateral faces, it's a triangle. The dihedral angle between this triangle and the base is 45 degrees.I remember that the dihedral angle can be calculated using the formula involving the height of the pyramid and the apothem of the base. The apothem is the distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one of its sides. Since the base is a square, the apothem would be half of the side length, right? Wait, no, the apothem of a square is actually the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is half the side length. So, for a square with side 'a', the apothem is a/2.But wait, actually, in a square, the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side is indeed a/2. So, the apothem is a/2. Now, the dihedral angle is the angle between the lateral face and the base. To find this angle, I think we can consider the angle between the lateral face and the base, which would involve the height of the pyramid and the apothem.Alternatively, maybe I should consider the angle between the lateral face and the base as the angle between the planes, which can be found using the height and the apothem. Let me think about the relationship between the dihedral angle and these measurements.I remember that the dihedral angle φ can be found using the formula:tan(φ) = height / apothemWait, is that correct? Let me verify. The dihedral angle is the angle between two planes, so in this case, between the lateral face and the base. To find this angle, we can consider the angle between the normals of the two planes, but that might be more complicated.Alternatively, maybe we can use the relationship in the triangle formed by the height, the apothem, and the slant height of the pyramid. The slant height is the height of the lateral face triangle, which is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge.Let me denote the height of the pyramid as h. The apothem of the base is a/2. The slant height, let's call it l, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by h, a/2, and l. So, l = sqrt(h^2 + (a/2)^2).But how does the dihedral angle come into play here? The dihedral angle is the angle between the lateral face and the base. I think this angle is related to the angle between the slant height and the base. Maybe it's the angle between the lateral face and the base, which would be the angle between the slant edge and the base.Wait, no, the dihedral angle is the angle between the two planes, not the angle between a line and a plane. So, perhaps I need to consider the angle between the lateral face and the base, which is 45 degrees.I think another approach is to consider the angle between the lateral face and the base. If I take a cross-section of the pyramid through the apex and the midpoint of a base edge, I get an isosceles triangle. The dihedral angle is the angle between this cross-section and the base.Wait, maybe I should think about the angle between the lateral face and the base in terms of the angle between their normals. The normal to the base is vertical, along the height of the pyramid. The normal to the lateral face can be found using the geometry of the pyramid.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider the angle between the lateral face and the base as the angle between the lateral face and the base plane. This can be found using the height and the apothem.Let me try to recall the formula for the dihedral angle. The dihedral angle φ can be calculated using the formula:tan(φ) = h / (a/2)Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have a right triangle where one leg is the height h, and the other leg is the apothem a/2, then the angle between the hypotenuse (which is the slant height) and the base would be φ. So, tan(φ) = opposite / adjacent = h / (a/2).Yes, that seems right. So, if the dihedral angle is 45 degrees, then tan(45°) = h / (a/2). But tan(45°) is 1, so 1 = h / (a/2), which implies h = a/2.Wait, is that possible? If the dihedral angle is 45 degrees, then the height is half the side length of the base? Let me check this again.Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the dihedral angle with another angle. Let me verify.The dihedral angle is the angle between two planes. To find this angle, we can use the angle between their normals. The normal to the base is vertical, and the normal to the lateral face can be found by considering the face.Alternatively, another method is to use the relationship between the height, the apothem, and the dihedral angle. The dihedral angle is the angle between the lateral face and the base, so it's the angle between the planes. To find this angle, we can consider the angle between the slant edge and the base.Wait, perhaps I should consider the angle between the lateral face and the base as the angle between the lateral face's altitude and the base's plane. Hmm, not sure.Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for dihedral angle in terms of the height and the base. Let me look up the formula.Wait, no, I should try to derive it. Let's consider the dihedral angle between the lateral face and the base. The dihedral angle can be found by considering the angle between the two planes. To find this, we can use the relationship between the height of the pyramid, the apothem, and the angle.If I consider the dihedral angle φ, then tan(φ) = h / (a/2). So, if φ is 45 degrees, then tan(45) = 1 = h / (a/2), so h = a/2.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me confirm with another approach.Another way to think about it is to consider the angle between the lateral face and the base. The lateral face is a triangle, and the base is a square. The dihedral angle is the angle between these two planes. To find this angle, we can use the relationship between the height of the pyramid and the apothem.If I imagine a line where the lateral face meets the base, which is the base edge of length 'a'. The dihedral angle is the angle between the lateral face and the base along this edge. To find this angle, we can consider the angle between the normals of the two planes.Alternatively, we can consider the angle between the lateral face and the base by looking at the triangle formed by the height, the apothem, and the slant height.Wait, perhaps using trigonometry in the triangle formed by the height, the apothem, and the slant height. The dihedral angle is the angle between the lateral face and the base, which would be the angle between the slant height and the base.Wait, no, the dihedral angle is the angle between the planes, not the angle between a line and a plane. So, perhaps I need to use the angle between the normals.The normal to the base is vertical, and the normal to the lateral face can be found by considering the face. The lateral face is a triangle, and its normal can be found using the cross product of two vectors lying on that face.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the formula for dihedral angle in terms of the height and the base. Let me think.The dihedral angle φ can be found using the formula:sin(φ) = h / lwhere l is the slant height.Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.Alternatively, the dihedral angle can be found using the relationship between the height, the apothem, and the angle. If I consider the dihedral angle as the angle between the lateral face and the base, then tan(φ) = h / (a/2).Yes, that seems to make sense because the height is opposite to the angle φ, and the adjacent side is the apothem, which is a/2.So, if tan(φ) = h / (a/2), and φ is 45 degrees, then tan(45) = 1 = h / (a/2), so h = a/2.Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check with another method.Another approach: The dihedral angle can be found using the angle between the lateral face and the base. If I consider the lateral face, which is an isosceles triangle, and the base, which is a square, the dihedral angle is the angle between these two planes.To find this angle, we can consider the angle between the normals of the two planes. The normal to the base is vertical, and the normal to the lateral face can be found by considering the face.Alternatively, we can use the relationship between the height, the apothem, and the angle. Let me think about the triangle formed by the height, the apothem, and the slant height.In this right triangle, the height h is one leg, the apothem a/2 is the other leg, and the slant height l is the hypotenuse. The angle between the slant height and the base is the angle whose tangent is h / (a/2). So, if the dihedral angle is 45 degrees, then tan(45) = h / (a/2), which gives h = a/2.Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation of the dihedral angle. Maybe I should consider the angle between the lateral face and the base as the angle between the planes, which is different from the angle between the slant height and the base.Let me try to recall the formula for dihedral angle. The dihedral angle can be calculated using the formula:cos(φ) = (n1 • n2) / (|n1| |n2|)where n1 and n2 are the normals to the two planes.In this case, the base is the xy-plane, so its normal is (0,0,1). The lateral face is a triangle, and we can find its normal by taking the cross product of two vectors lying on that face.Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place the base of the pyramid on the xy-plane with its center at the origin. So, the base square has vertices at (a/2, a/2, 0), (-a/2, a/2, 0), (-a/2, -a/2, 0), and (a/2, -a/2, 0). The apex is at (0,0,h).Now, consider one of the lateral faces, say the one with vertices at (a/2, a/2, 0), (-a/2, a/2, 0), and (0,0,h). Let me find two vectors on this face. For example, vector v1 from (a/2, a/2, 0) to (-a/2, a/2, 0) is (-a, 0, 0). Vector v2 from (a/2, a/2, 0) to (0,0,h) is (-a/2, -a/2, h).Now, the normal vector n2 to the lateral face is the cross product of v1 and v2.Calculating the cross product:v1 = (-a, 0, 0)v2 = (-a/2, -a/2, h)n2 = v1 × v2 = |i   j   k|              |-a   0   0|              |-a/2 -a/2 h|= i*(0*h - 0*(-a/2)) - j*(-a*h - 0*(-a/2)) + k*(-a*(-a/2) - 0*(-a/2))= i*(0 - 0) - j*(-a h - 0) + k*(a^2/2 - 0)= 0i + a h j + (a^2/2)kSo, n2 = (0, a h, a^2/2)Now, the normal vector to the base is n1 = (0,0,1).The dihedral angle φ between the two planes is the angle between n1 and n2. So, we can find cos(φ) using the dot product:cos(φ) = (n1 • n2) / (|n1| |n2|)n1 • n2 = 0*0 + 0*(a h) + 1*(a^2/2) = a^2/2|n1| = sqrt(0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) = 1|n2| = sqrt(0^2 + (a h)^2 + (a^2/2)^2) = sqrt(a^2 h^2 + a^4 /4)So,cos(φ) = (a^2 / 2) / sqrt(a^2 h^2 + a^4 /4)Simplify the denominator:sqrt(a^2 h^2 + a^4 /4) = a sqrt(h^2 + a^2 /4)So,cos(φ) = (a^2 / 2) / (a sqrt(h^2 + a^2 /4)) ) = (a / 2) / sqrt(h^2 + a^2 /4)Given that φ is 45 degrees, so cos(45°) = √2 / 2.Thus,√2 / 2 = (a / 2) / sqrt(h^2 + a^2 /4)Multiply both sides by sqrt(h^2 + a^2 /4):√2 / 2 * sqrt(h^2 + a^2 /4) = a / 2Multiply both sides by 2:√2 * sqrt(h^2 + a^2 /4) = aDivide both sides by √2:sqrt(h^2 + a^2 /4) = a / √2Square both sides:h^2 + a^2 /4 = a^2 / 2Subtract a^2 /4 from both sides:h^2 = a^2 / 2 - a^2 /4 = a^2 /4So, h = a / 2Wait, so the height is a/2. That's the same result as before. So, despite the initial confusion, both methods lead to the same conclusion.Therefore, the height of the pyramid is a/2.But let me just think again if this makes sense. If the dihedral angle is 45 degrees, which is a relatively shallow angle, the height shouldn't be too large. Since the apothem is a/2, and tan(45) is 1, h = a/2 seems reasonable.Alternatively, if the dihedral angle were 0 degrees, the pyramid would be flat, and the height would be 0. If the dihedral angle were 90 degrees, the lateral face would be perpendicular to the base, which would make the pyramid very tall, but in that case, h would be infinite, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, if the dihedral angle is 90 degrees, the lateral face is perpendicular to the base, which would mean the pyramid is a right pyramid with the apex directly above the base, but the height would be such that the lateral face is perpendicular. Hmm, perhaps in that case, the height would be related to the apothem in a different way.But in our case, the dihedral angle is 45 degrees, so h = a/2 is correct.So, after going through the process, I think the height of the pyramid is a/2."},{"question":"A company transported a batch of ceramic vases from a certain location, of which 50 were damaged. If the remaining vases are sold at 10 yuan each, the company will incur a loss of 300 yuan. If the price is increased by 2 yuan per vase, the company will make a profit of 800 yuan. How many ceramic vases did the company transport in total?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of vases transported by the company. I'll start by defining the variables involved in the problem.Let ( x ) represent the total number of vases transported. Out of these, 50 vases were damaged, so the number of undamaged vases is ( x - 50 ).Next, I'll consider the cost and revenue scenarios provided. In the first scenario, the undamaged vases are sold at 10 yuan each, resulting in a loss of 300 yuan. This means the total revenue from sales is 300 yuan less than the total cost. I'll express this relationship with the equation:[10(x - 50) = C - 300]where ( C ) is the total cost of transporting the vases.In the second scenario, the price per vase is increased by 2 yuan, making it 12 yuan per vase. At this price, the company makes a profit of 800 yuan. This means the total revenue exceeds the total cost by 800 yuan. I'll express this with the equation:[12(x - 50) = C + 800]Now, I have a system of two equations:[10(x - 50) = C - 300][12(x - 50) = C + 800]To solve for ( x ), I'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate ( C ):[12(x - 50) - 10(x - 50) = (C + 800) - (C - 300)]Simplifying this, I get:[2(x - 50) = 1100][x - 50 = 550][x = 600]Therefore, the company transported a total of 600 ceramic vases."},{"question":"At the start of this month, Mathilde and Salah each had 100 coins.

This means that 100 coins is 80% of his coins from last month.

If he initially increased his speed by 2 m/s, he would reach school 2.5 times faster. How many times faster would he reach school if he initially increased his speed by 4 m/s?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Vanya runs from home to school at a constant speed. The problem says that if he increases his speed by 2 m/s, he would reach school 2.5 times faster. I need to figure out how many times faster he would reach if he increases his speed by 4 m/s instead. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand what it means to reach school \\"2.5 times faster.\\" I think this refers to the time taken to reach school. If he goes faster, the time taken decreases. So, if he increases his speed by 2 m/s, the time taken becomes 1/2.5 times the original time, right? Because if something is 2.5 times faster, it takes less time. So, maybe the time is inversely proportional to the speed.Let me denote Vanya's original speed as ( v ) m/s. The distance from home to school is constant, so let's call that ( d ) meters. The time taken to reach school at the original speed is ( t = frac{d}{v} ).Now, when he increases his speed by 2 m/s, his new speed becomes ( v + 2 ) m/s. The time taken at this new speed is ( t' = frac{d}{v + 2} ). According to the problem, this new time ( t' ) is 1/2.5 times the original time ( t ). So, I can write the equation:( frac{d}{v + 2} = frac{1}{2.5} times frac{d}{v} )Hmm, let me simplify this equation. First, I can cancel out ( d ) from both sides since it's non-zero. So, that gives:( frac{1}{v + 2} = frac{1}{2.5} times frac{1}{v} )Let me rewrite 2.5 as a fraction to make it easier. 2.5 is equal to ( frac{5}{2} ), so ( frac{1}{2.5} = frac{2}{5} ). Substituting that in, the equation becomes:( frac{1}{v + 2} = frac{2}{5v} )Now, I can cross-multiply to solve for ( v ):( 5v = 2(v + 2) )Expanding the right side:( 5v = 2v + 4 )Subtracting ( 2v ) from both sides:( 3v = 4 )So, ( v = frac{4}{3} ) m/s. Okay, so Vanya's original speed is ( frac{4}{3} ) m/s.Now, the problem asks how many times faster he would reach school if he increased his speed by 4 m/s instead. So, his new speed would be ( v + 4 = frac{4}{3} + 4 = frac{4}{3} + frac{12}{3} = frac{16}{3} ) m/s.Let me find the new time taken with this speed. The distance ( d ) is the same, so:( t'' = frac{d}{v + 4} = frac{d}{frac{16}{3}} = frac{3d}{16} )The original time was ( t = frac{d}{v} = frac{d}{frac{4}{3}} = frac{3d}{4} ).To find how many times faster he reaches, I need to find the ratio of the original time to the new time. So:( frac{t}{t''} = frac{frac{3d}{4}}{frac{3d}{16}} = frac{3d}{4} times frac{16}{3d} = frac{16}{4} = 4 )So, the time taken is 4 times less, meaning he reaches 4 times faster.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the original speed ( v = frac{4}{3} ) m/s by setting up the equation based on the time ratio. Then, I calculated the new speed as ( frac{16}{3} ) m/s. Then, I found the original time ( t = frac{3d}{4} ) and the new time ( t'' = frac{3d}{16} ). The ratio ( frac{t}{t''} ) is indeed 4, so he reaches 4 times faster.Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of speed and time inversely proportional. If speed increases by a factor, time decreases by the same factor. So, when he increased his speed by 2 m/s, his speed became ( frac{4}{3} + 2 = frac{10}{3} ) m/s. The ratio of new speed to original speed is ( frac{frac{10}{3}}{frac{4}{3}} = frac{10}{4} = frac{5}{2} ). So, the time taken is ( frac{2}{5} ) times the original time, which is consistent with the problem statement saying he reaches 2.5 times faster (since 2.5 is 5/2, and the time is 2/5, so it's reciprocal). So, that checks out.Similarly, when he increases his speed by 4 m/s, his new speed is ( frac{16}{3} ) m/s, so the ratio is ( frac{frac{16}{3}}{frac{4}{3}} = 4 ). Therefore, the time taken is ( frac{1}{4} ) times the original time, meaning he reaches 4 times faster. So, that seems correct.I think I've got it right. So, the answer should be 4 times faster.**Final Answer**boxed{4}"},{"question":"Van was asked to add 46 to 37 and round the result to the nearest ten.

Point A is given as (x, 0, 0), and points B and C are given as (4, 0, 5) and (5, 4, 2) respectively. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if a point is equidistant from two other points, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting those two points. But since we're dealing with three-dimensional space, it's a bit more complex than just a line. Maybe I can use the distance formula in 3D to set up an equation.The distance formula in three dimensions between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2]. Since point A is equidistant from B and C, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from A to C.So, let me write that equation out. The distance from A(x, 0, 0) to B(4, 0, 5) is sqrt[(4 - x)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (5 - 0)^2], right? And the distance from A(x, 0, 0) to C(5, 4, 2) is sqrt[(5 - x)^2 + (4 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2].Since these distances are equal, I can set their squares equal to each other to eliminate the square roots. That gives me:(4 - x)^2 + (0)^2 + (5)^2 = (5 - x)^2 + (4)^2 + (2)^2.Let me compute each term step by step.First, expanding (4 - x)^2: that's 16 - 8x + x^2.Then, (0)^2 is just 0.And (5)^2 is 25.So, the left side becomes 16 - 8x + x^2 + 0 + 25, which simplifies to x^2 - 8x + 41.Now, the right side: (5 - x)^2 is 25 - 10x + x^2.(4)^2 is 16.(2)^2 is 4.Adding those up: 25 - 10x + x^2 + 16 + 4. That simplifies to x^2 - 10x + 45.So now, the equation is:x^2 - 8x + 41 = x^2 - 10x + 45.Hmm, let me subtract x^2 from both sides to simplify. That leaves:-8x + 41 = -10x + 45.Now, let's get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. I'll add 10x to both sides:-8x + 10x + 41 = 45.Which simplifies to:2x + 41 = 45.Subtract 41 from both sides:2x = 4.Divide both sides by 2:x = 2.So, the x-coordinate of point A is 2. Since point A is given as (x, 0, 0), plugging in x = 2 gives us the coordinates (2, 0, 0).Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, expanding both sides:Left side: (4 - x)^2 + 25 = (16 - 8x + x^2) + 25 = x^2 - 8x + 41.Right side: (5 - x)^2 + 16 + 4 = (25 - 10x + x^2) + 20 = x^2 - 10x + 45.Setting them equal: x^2 - 8x + 41 = x^2 - 10x + 45.Subtract x^2: -8x + 41 = -10x + 45.Add 10x: 2x + 41 = 45.Subtract 41: 2x = 4.Divide by 2: x = 2.Looks correct. So, yeah, point A is at (2, 0, 0).Just to be thorough, let me compute the distances from A(2,0,0) to B and C to ensure they are equal.Distance AB: sqrt[(4 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (5 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(2)^2 + 0 + (5)^2] = sqrt[4 + 0 + 25] = sqrt[29].Distance AC: sqrt[(5 - 2)^2 + (4 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(3)^2 + (4)^2 + (2)^2] = sqrt[9 + 16 + 4] = sqrt[29].Yep, both distances are sqrt(29), so they are equal. Therefore, point A is indeed (2, 0, 0).I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident about this answer.**Final Answer**The coordinates of point ( A ) are boxed{(2, 0, 0)}."},{"question":"Calculate the variance of the data set 2, 4, 5, 3, 6.","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of data points in the set.

What is the sum of those five prime numbers?","answer":"First, I need to identify five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6. This means each subsequent number in the sequence is 6 more than the previous one.I'll start by considering the smallest prime number, which is 2. If I add 6 repeatedly, the sequence would be 2, 8, 14, 20, 26. However, 8, 14, 20, and 26 are not prime numbers, so this sequence doesn't work.Next, I'll try starting with the next prime number, 3. Adding 6 each time gives me 3, 9, 15, 21, 27. Again, 9, 15, 21, and 27 are not primes, so this sequence is also invalid.Moving on to the next prime number, 5. The sequence would be 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. Checking each of these, I find that all are prime numbers. This sequence meets the criteria of having a common difference of 6 and consisting entirely of primes.To confirm there are no other such sequences, I'll check the next few prime numbers. Starting with 7, the sequence would be 7, 13, 19, 25, 31. Here, 25 is not a prime number, so this sequence doesn't work. Similarly, starting with 11 gives me 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, where 35 is not prime.Since I've checked the initial prime numbers and only the sequence starting with 5 meets the requirements, I can conclude that the only valid sequence is 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29. Adding these together gives a sum of 85."},{"question":"Given a function f(x) defined on R such that f(x) + x^{2} is an odd function and f(x) + x^{3} is an even function, then f(2) is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find f(2) given some conditions about the function f(x). Let me try to understand what's being asked here.The problem states that f(x) is defined on all real numbers, and two conditions are given:1. f(x) + x² is an odd function.2. f(x) + x³ is an even function.I need to find f(2). Hmm, okay. Let's recall what odd and even functions are.An odd function satisfies the property that g(-x) = -g(x) for all x. An even function satisfies h(-x) = h(x) for all x. So, I can use these properties to set up equations involving f(x).Let me denote the first function as g(x) = f(x) + x², which is odd. So, by definition, g(-x) = -g(x). Similarly, the second function is h(x) = f(x) + x³, which is even, so h(-x) = h(x).Let me write down these equations:1. g(-x) = -g(x) ⇒ f(-x) + (-x)² = -[f(x) + x²]2. h(-x) = h(x) ⇒ f(-x) + (-x)³ = f(x) + x³Simplify these equations.Starting with the first equation:f(-x) + (-x)² = -f(x) - x²But (-x)² is x², so:f(-x) + x² = -f(x) - x²Let me rearrange this:f(-x) = -f(x) - x² - x²Wait, that would be:f(-x) = -f(x) - 2x²Wait, hold on, let me check that again.Starting from:f(-x) + x² = -f(x) - x²Subtract x² from both sides:f(-x) = -f(x) - x² - x²Which simplifies to:f(-x) = -f(x) - 2x²Yes, that seems correct.Now, moving on to the second equation:h(-x) = h(x) ⇒ f(-x) + (-x)³ = f(x) + x³Simplify (-x)³, which is -x³, so:f(-x) - x³ = f(x) + x³Let me rearrange this:f(-x) = f(x) + x³ + x³Which simplifies to:f(-x) = f(x) + 2x³Okay, so now I have two expressions for f(-x):From the first condition: f(-x) = -f(x) - 2x²From the second condition: f(-x) = f(x) + 2x³Since both expressions equal f(-x), I can set them equal to each other:-f(x) - 2x² = f(x) + 2x³Let me solve for f(x). Bring all terms to one side:-f(x) - 2x² - f(x) - 2x³ = 0Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me subtract f(x) + 2x³ from both sides:-f(x) - 2x² - f(x) - 2x³ = 0Wait, that might not be the best way. Let me instead bring all terms to the left side:-f(x) - 2x² - f(x) - 2x³ = 0Wait, actually, let me do it step by step.Starting from:-f(x) - 2x² = f(x) + 2x³Add f(x) to both sides:-2x² = 2f(x) + 2x³Then, subtract 2x³ from both sides:-2x² - 2x³ = 2f(x)Divide both sides by 2:f(x) = (-2x² - 2x³)/2Simplify:f(x) = -x² - x³Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from:-f(x) - 2x² = f(x) + 2x³Adding f(x) to both sides:-2x² = 2f(x) + 2x³Subtracting 2x³:-2x² - 2x³ = 2f(x)Divide by 2:f(x) = -x² - x³Yes, that looks correct.So, f(x) = -x² - x³. Therefore, f(2) would be:f(2) = -(2)² - (2)³ = -4 - 8 = -12Wait, so f(2) is -12? Let me verify this with the original conditions to make sure.First condition: f(x) + x² should be odd.Compute f(x) + x²:(-x² - x³) + x² = -x³Is -x³ an odd function? Yes, because (-x)^3 = -x³, so g(-x) = -g(x). That checks out.Second condition: f(x) + x³ should be even.Compute f(x) + x³:(-x² - x³) + x³ = -x²Is -x² an even function? Yes, because (-x)^2 = x², so h(-x) = h(x). That also checks out.Great, so f(x) = -x² - x³ is correct, and therefore f(2) = -12.Wait, let me just compute f(2) again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.f(2) = -(2)^2 - (2)^3 = -4 - 8 = -12.

Now, using the systematic sampling method to draw a sample of size 4, it is known that students with numbers 3, 29, and 42 are in the sample. What is the student number of the fourth student in the sample?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 52 students in a class, and they're using systematic sampling to draw a sample of size 4. I know that students with numbers 3, 29, and 42 are in the sample, and I need to find the number of the fourth student. Hmm, let me think about how systematic sampling works.First off, systematic sampling is a method where you select every k-th element from a population. The key here is determining the sampling interval, k. Since the sample size is 4 and the population is 52, I can calculate k by dividing the population size by the sample size. So, k would be 52 divided by 4, which is 13. That means every 13th student is selected.But wait, let me make sure. So, if k is 13, then starting from a random number between 1 and 13, we add 13 each time to get the next sample. So, if the starting point is, say, 3, then the next would be 16, then 29, then 42, and then 55. But wait, 55 is beyond 52, so we might wrap around or just stop. Hmm, but in this case, the sample size is 4, so maybe we don't go beyond 52.Wait, but the students given are 3, 29, and 42. Let me see if these fit into a systematic sampling pattern with k=13. Starting at 3, adding 13 gives 16, then 29, then 42, and then 55. But 55 is beyond 52, so maybe the next one would be 55 - 52 = 3? That seems like circular systematic sampling. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.Alternatively, maybe the starting point isn't 3. Maybe 3 is just one of the selected numbers, not necessarily the first. So, perhaps the starting point is somewhere else, and 3 is the first, second, or third element in the sample.Let me try to figure out the interval. If 3, 29, and 42 are in the sample, let me see the differences between them. 29 - 3 = 26, and 42 - 29 = 13. Hmm, so the difference between 3 and 29 is 26, which is 2k, and between 29 and 42 is 13, which is k. That seems inconsistent. Maybe I need to check the intervals.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me double-check. The formula for k is population size divided by sample size, so 52 / 4 = 13. So, k is indeed 13. So, the interval is 13.Now, if the starting point is 3, then the next would be 16, then 29, then 42, and then 55. But 55 is beyond 52, so maybe the next one is 55 - 52 = 3, but that would just loop back to 3, which is already in the sample. So, maybe the fourth student is 55, but since we only have 52 students, perhaps the fourth student is 55 - 52 = 3, but that's already in the sample. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe the starting point isn't 3. Maybe 3 is the second or third element in the sample. Let me think. If 3 is the second element, then the first element would be 3 - 13 = -10, which doesn't make sense because student numbers can't be negative. So, that can't be.If 3 is the third element, then the first element would be 3 - 2*13 = 3 - 26 = -23, which is also negative. Not possible.If 3 is the fourth element, then the first element would be 3 - 3*13 = 3 - 39 = -36, which is still negative. So, that can't be either.Hmm, so maybe 3 is the first element. Then the next would be 16, then 29, then 42, and then 55. But 55 is beyond 52, so maybe we stop at 42, but we need a fourth element. Alternatively, maybe we wrap around, so 55 - 52 = 3, but 3 is already in the sample. So, that doesn't help.Wait, maybe the interval isn't 13. Maybe I miscalculated k. Let me think again. If the sample size is 4, then k is 52 / 4 = 13. So, that's correct. But maybe the starting point isn't 3. Maybe 3 is the second element.Wait, let's see. If 3 is the second element, then the first element would be 3 - 13 = -10, which is invalid. So, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is 3, but the interval is different. Wait, but the interval is determined by the population size and sample size, so it should be 13.Wait, another thought: maybe the sampling is done without wrapping around. So, if the next element is beyond 52, we just stop. So, in that case, the fourth element would be 55, but since we only have 52 students, maybe the fourth element is 55 - 52 = 3, but that's already in the sample. So, that doesn't make sense.Alternatively, maybe the fourth element is 55, but since we can't have that, perhaps we just take the next available, which would be 3 again, but that's already in the sample. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list the possible systematic samples with k=13.Starting at 1: 1, 14, 27, 40, 53 (but 53 is beyond 52, so maybe stop at 40). But we have 3, 29, 42 in the sample, so that's not matching.Starting at 2: 2, 15, 28, 41, 54. Again, 54 is beyond 52, so stop at 41. Doesn't match.Starting at 3: 3, 16, 29, 42, 55. 55 is beyond 52, so stop at 42. So, the sample would be 3, 16, 29, 42. But in the problem, the sample includes 3, 29, 42, so the fourth element would be 16. But wait, in the problem, the sample size is 4, so if we start at 3, the fourth element is 42, and the fifth would be 55, which is beyond, so maybe the fourth element is 42, but we already have 42 as the third element. Hmm, this is confusing.Wait, no, if starting at 3, the elements would be 3, 16, 29, 42. So, that's four elements: 3, 16, 29, 42. So, the fourth element is 42. But in the problem, 42 is already in the sample, so maybe the fourth element is 16? But the problem says the sample includes 3, 29, 42, and we need to find the fourth. So, if the sample is 3, 16, 29, 42, then the fourth is 42, but that's already given. Wait, no, 42 is the third element, so the fourth would be 55, which is beyond. So, maybe the fourth element is 16?Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list the elements step by step.If k=13, starting at 3:1st element: 32nd element: 3 + 13 = 163rd element: 16 + 13 = 294th element: 29 + 13 = 425th element: 42 + 13 = 55 (beyond 52)So, the sample would be 3, 16, 29, 42. So, the fourth element is 42, but in the problem, 42 is already given as one of the elements. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Wait, but the problem says the sample includes 3, 29, 42, and we need to find the fourth. So, if the sample is 3, 16, 29, 42, then the fourth element is 42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Wait, but in the sample, 3, 29, 42 are given, so the fourth must be 16. So, is the answer 16?But let me check another possibility. Maybe the starting point isn't 3. Maybe 3 is the second element. Let's see.If 3 is the second element, then the first element would be 3 - 13 = -10, which is invalid. So, that can't be.If 3 is the third element, then the first element would be 3 - 2*13 = -23, invalid.If 3 is the fourth element, then the first element would be 3 - 3*13 = -36, invalid.So, 3 must be the first element. Therefore, the sample is 3, 16, 29, 42. So, the fourth element is 42, but that's already given. Wait, but the problem says the sample includes 3, 29, 42, so the fourth must be 16.Wait, but in the sample, the fourth element is 42, which is already given. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is different. Let me think.Wait, maybe the interval isn't 13. Maybe I miscalculated k. Let me check again.k = population size / sample size = 52 / 4 = 13. So, k=13 is correct.Wait, but maybe the starting point is not 3. Maybe 3 is the second element. Let me try that.If 3 is the second element, then the first element would be 3 - 13 = -10, which is invalid. So, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is 16. Let's see.Starting at 16:1st: 162nd: 16 +13=293rd:29+13=424th:42+13=55 (invalid)So, sample would be 16,29,42,55. But 55 is invalid, so maybe stop at 42. But the sample size is 4, so maybe we need to adjust.Wait, but in the problem, the sample includes 3,29,42, so 16 isn't in the sample. So, that can't be.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is 29.Starting at 29:1st:292nd:29+13=423rd:42+13=55 (invalid)So, sample would be 29,42,55, which is only 3 elements, but we need 4. So, that doesn't work.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is 42.Starting at 42:1st:422nd:42+13=55 (invalid)So, only one element, which is not enough.Hmm, so the only way to get 3,29,42 in the sample is if the starting point is 3, and the interval is 13, giving 3,16,29,42. So, the fourth element is 42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Wait, but in the sample, 3,29,42 are given, so the fourth must be 16.Alternatively, maybe the fourth element is 55, but since that's beyond 52, maybe we take 55 - 52 = 3, but that's already in the sample. So, that doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe the interval is different. Let me think again. Maybe k isn't 13. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating k.Wait, the formula for k is N / n, where N is population size, n is sample size. So, 52 /4=13. So, k=13 is correct.Wait, but maybe the starting point is different. Let me think. If 3 is the first element, then the sample is 3,16,29,42. So, the fourth element is 42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is 3, and the fourth element is 42, which is given, so the fourth element is 42, but that's already in the sample. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try a different approach.Given that the sample includes 3,29,42, and we need to find the fourth. Let's see the differences between these numbers.29 -3=2642-29=13So, the difference between 3 and 29 is 26, which is 2k, since k=13.Then, from 29 to 42 is 13, which is k.So, that suggests that 3 is the first element, 16 is the second, 29 is the third, and 42 is the fourth. So, the fourth element is 42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Wait, but in the sample, 3,29,42 are given, so the fourth must be 16.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is 3, and the fourth element is 42, which is given, so the fourth element is 42, but that's already in the sample. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list the elements again.Starting at 3:1st:32nd:3+13=163rd:16+13=294th:29+13=42So, the sample is 3,16,29,42. So, the fourth element is 42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is 16.Wait, but in the problem, the sample includes 3,29,42, so the fourth element must be 16.Alternatively, maybe the fourth element is 55, but that's beyond 52, so maybe it's 55-52=3, but that's already in the sample.Wait, maybe the fourth element is 16.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is 16.Starting at 16:1st:162nd:293rd:424th:55 (invalid)So, the sample would be 16,29,42,55. But 55 is invalid, so maybe the fourth element is 16, but that's already the first element.Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe the starting point is 29.Starting at 29:1st:292nd:423rd:55 (invalid)So, only two elements, which is not enough.Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps the interval isn't 13. Maybe it's a different interval. Let me check.If the sample includes 3,29,42, let's see the differences.From 3 to29 is 26, which is 2*13.From29 to42 is13.So, that suggests that the interval is13, but the first interval is26, which is 2*13. So, maybe the starting point is3, then next is16, then29, then42.So, the fourth element is42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is16.Alternatively, maybe the starting point is16.Wait, but if the starting point is16, then the sample would be16,29,42,55. But55 is invalid, so maybe the fourth element is16, but that's already the first element.Wait, this is confusing.Wait, maybe the interval is13, but the starting point is3, so the sample is3,16,29,42. So, the fourth element is42, which is already given. So, maybe the fourth element is16.Wait, but in the problem, the sample includes3,29,42, so the fourth element must be16.Alternatively, maybe the fourth element is55, but that's beyond52, so maybe it's3 again, but that's already in the sample.Wait, maybe the fourth element is16.Alternatively, maybe the interval is different. Let me think.Wait, if the interval is13, starting at3, the sample is3,16,29,42. So, the fourth element is42, which is already given. So, maybe the fourth element is16.Alternatively, maybe the interval is26, but that would mean k=26, which would give a sample size of2, which is not the case.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the positions.If k=13, starting at3, the positions are3,16,29,42. So, the fourth position is42. So, the fourth element is42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is16.Wait, but in the problem, the sample includes3,29,42, so the fourth element must be16.Alternatively, maybe the fourth element is55, but that's beyond52, so maybe it's3 again, but that's already in the sample.Wait, I'm going in circles. Maybe the answer is16.Alternatively, maybe the fourth element is55, but since that's beyond52, maybe it's55-52=3, but that's already in the sample.Wait, maybe the fourth element is16.I think I've thought this through enough. The sample is3,16,29,42, so the fourth element is42, but since42 is already given, the fourth element must be16.Wait, no, in the sample, the fourth element is42, which is given, so the fourth element is42, but that's already in the sample. So, maybe the fourth element is16.Wait, I'm confused. Let me try to write down the elements step by step.Starting at3:1st:32nd:3+13=163rd:16+13=294th:29+13=42So, the sample is3,16,29,42. So, the fourth element is42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is16.Wait, but in the problem, the sample includes3,29,42, so the fourth element must be16.Alternatively, maybe the fourth element is55, but that's beyond52, so maybe it's3 again, but that's already in the sample.Wait, I think the answer is16.But let me check another way. If the sample is3,29,42, and we need a fourth, and the interval is13, then the fourth element should be either before3 or after42.If before3, it would be3-13=-10, which is invalid.If after42, it's42+13=55, which is beyond52.So, maybe the fourth element is16, which is between3 and29.Wait, but in systematic sampling, you don't skip elements. You just add the interval each time.So, starting at3, the next is16, then29, then42.So, the sample is3,16,29,42.So, the fourth element is42, but that's already given. So, maybe the fourth element is16.Wait, but in the problem, the sample includes3,29,42, so the fourth element must be16.Alternatively, maybe the fourth element is55, but that's beyond52.Wait, I think the answer is16.But let me check again.If the sample is3,16,29,42, then the fourth element is42, which is given, so the fourth element is42, but that's already in the sample.

I think the answer is16.Wait, but in the sample, the fourth element is42, which is given, so the fourth element is42, but that's already in the sample.

Denote S_n as the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n}. Find the value of S_{2014}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a sequence {a_n} where a_1 is 1, and the difference between consecutive terms is given by a_{n+1} - a_n = sin((n+1)π/2). I need to find S_{2014}, which is the sum of the first 2014 terms of this sequence.First, let me try to understand the problem. I know that a_1 is 1, and each subsequent term is obtained by adding sin((n+1)π/2) to the previous term. So, to find a general formula for a_n, I might need to compute the cumulative sum of these sine terms starting from a_1.Since S_n is the sum of the first n terms, S_{2014} = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{2014}. But to find this, I probably need a formula for a_n first.Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.Given:a_1 = 1a_{n+1} - a_n = sin((n+1)π/2)So, a_2 = a_1 + sin(2π/2) = 1 + sin(π) = 1 + 0 = 1a_3 = a_2 + sin(3π/2) = 1 + sin(3π/2) = 1 + (-1) = 0a_4 = a_3 + sin(4π/2) = 0 + sin(2π) = 0 + 0 = 0a_5 = a_4 + sin(5π/2) = 0 + sin(5π/2) = 0 + 1 = 1a_6 = a_5 + sin(6π/2) = 1 + sin(3π) = 1 + 0 = 1a_7 = a_6 + sin(7π/2) = 1 + sin(7π/2) = 1 + (-1) = 0a_8 = a_7 + sin(8π/2) = 0 + sin(4π) = 0 + 0 = 0Hmm, so the sequence seems to be cycling through 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, etc. So every four terms, it repeats the pattern 1, 1, 0, 0.Let me check that:a_1 = 1a_2 = 1a_3 = 0a_4 = 0a_5 = 1a_6 = 1a_7 = 0a_8 = 0Yes, that's a cycle of four terms: 1, 1, 0, 0. So the sequence is periodic with period 4.Therefore, the terms a_n cycle every four terms as 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, etc.So, to find S_{2014}, which is the sum of the first 2014 terms, I can exploit this periodicity.First, let's figure out how many complete cycles of four terms are in 2014 terms, and then the sum of the remaining terms.2014 divided by 4 is 503 with a remainder of 2, because 4*503 = 2012, so 2014 - 2012 = 2.So, there are 503 complete cycles and 2 extra terms.Each cycle of four terms sums to 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2.Therefore, the sum of 503 cycles is 503 * 2 = 1006.Now, the remaining 2 terms are the first two terms of the next cycle, which are 1 and 1. So their sum is 1 + 1 = 2.Therefore, the total sum S_{2014} is 1006 + 2 = 1008.Wait, hold on. Let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with cycles, it's easy to miscount.Each cycle is four terms, each cycle sums to 2. So 503 cycles give 503*2=1006.Then, the remaining two terms are a_{2013} and a_{2014}. Let's see:Since 2012 is the last term of the 503rd cycle, so a_{2013} is the first term of the next cycle, which is 1, and a_{2014} is the second term, which is also 1. So yes, their sum is 2.Therefore, S_{2014}=1006+2=1008.Wait, but let me think again. The first term is a_1, so term 1: a_1=1, term 2: a_2=1, term 3: a_3=0, term 4: a_4=0, term 5: a_5=1, etc. So in each block of four terms, the first two are 1s and the next two are 0s.Therefore, in each block, the sum is 2.So, 2014 terms consist of 503 blocks (each of 4 terms) and 2 extra terms.Each block contributes 2, so 503*2=1006.The two extra terms are the first two terms of the next block, which are 1 and 1, so 2.Therefore, total sum is 1006 + 2 = 1008.Wait, but let me check with a smaller number to see if this logic holds.For example, let's compute S_4:a1=1, a2=1, a3=0, a4=0. So sum is 1+1+0+0=2. Which is 1 block, sum=2. Correct.S_5: 2 (from first 4 terms) + a5=1, so total 3.Wait, according to my earlier logic, 5 terms would be 1 block (4 terms) and 1 extra term. The extra term is a5=1, so sum would be 2 +1=3. Correct.Similarly, S_6: 2 (first 4) + a5=1 + a6=1, total 4. Which is 1 block (sum 2) plus two extra terms (sum 2), total 4. Correct.Wait, but according to my initial calculation, 503 blocks and 2 extra terms give 1006 + 2=1008. So for S_6, which is 6 terms, it's 1 block (4 terms) and 2 extra terms, so 2 + 2=4, which is correct.Similarly, S_2: 1 +1=2. Which is 0 blocks and 2 extra terms, sum=2. Correct.S_3: 1 +1 +0=2. Which is 0 blocks and 3 terms. Wait, 3 divided by 4 is 0 with remainder 3. So 0 blocks, sum 0, plus 3 terms: 1 +1 +0=2. Correct.Wait, so in general, S_n = number_of_blocks * 2 + sum_of_remaining_terms.Therefore, for n=2014, number_of_blocks=503, sum_of_remaining_terms=2, so total sum=503*2 +2=1006 +2=1008.Therefore, the answer is 1008.But just to make sure, let me compute a few more terms and their sums.Compute S_7: a1+a2+a3+a4+a5+a6+a7=1+1+0+0+1+1+0=4.According to the formula: 7 divided by 4 is 1 block (4 terms, sum=2) and 3 remaining terms: a5=1, a6=1, a7=0. Sum=1+1+0=2. So total sum=2+2=4. Correct.Similarly, S_8: 1+1+0+0+1+1+0+0=4. According to formula: 8/4=2 blocks, each sum=2, so 2*2=4. Correct.So, the formula seems consistent.Therefore, I can be confident that S_{2014}=1008.**Final Answer**boxed{1008}"},{"question":"Calculate the result of (sqrt{3})^{2}+1.","answer":"First, I need to calculate the square of the square root of 3.

To get out, you must open all the doors and disarm all the mines. In the room is a panel with 3 buttons, which contains an instruction manual. The red button arms a mine, the yellow button disarms two mines and closes a door, and the green button opens two doors. Initially, 3 doors are closed, and 3 mines are armed. The manual warns that attempting to disarm two mines or open two doors when only one is armed/closed will reset the system to its initial state. What is the minimum number of buttons you must push to get out?","answer":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get out of this room. There are three buttons: red, yellow, and green. Each does something different. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.First, the initial state: 3 doors are closed, and 3 mines are armed. My goal is to open all the doors and disarm all the mines. That means I need to get to 0 closed doors and 0 armed mines. The buttons do the following:- Red button: Arms a mine. So if I press red, the number of armed mines increases by 1.- Yellow button: Disarms two mines and closes a door. So pressing yellow decreases armed mines by 2 and increases closed doors by 1.- Green button: Opens two doors. So pressing green decreases closed doors by 2.But there's a catch: if I try to press yellow when there are fewer than two mines armed, or press green when there are fewer than two doors closed, the system resets to the initial state. That means I have to be careful not to press buttons when I can't perform their actions.Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can represent the state as a pair (doors closed, mines armed). So initially, it's (3, 3). I need to get to (0, 0).Each button press changes the state:- Red: (d, m) → (d, m+1)- Yellow: (d, m) → (d+1, m-2)- Green: (d, m) → (d-2, m)But with the constraints that pressing yellow requires m ≥ 2, and pressing green requires d ≥ 2. Otherwise, it resets.I need to find the shortest sequence of button presses that takes me from (3, 3) to (0, 0) without triggering a reset.Let me try to map out possible states and see the transitions.Starting at (3, 3).From here, I can press red, yellow, or green.If I press red: (3, 4). But that doesn't seem helpful because I need to reduce mines, not increase them.If I press yellow: (4, 1). Because 3 mines - 2 = 1, and 3 doors +1 = 4. Hmm, but now I have 4 doors closed and 1 mine armed. That might complicate things because I need to open two doors at a time.If I press green: (1, 3). Because 3 doors - 2 = 1, and mines remain 3. Now I have 1 door closed and 3 mines armed. But pressing green again would require at least 2 doors closed, so I can't press green again until I have at least 2 doors closed.So from (3,3), pressing green gets me to (1,3). From there, I can't press green again. So I have to press red or yellow.If I press red from (1,3): (1,4). Not helpful.If I press yellow from (1,3): Disarm two mines, so 3-2=1, and close a door, so 1+1=2. So now I'm at (2,1). Hmm, but now I have 2 doors closed and 1 mine armed.From (2,1), I can press green: (0,1). Because 2-2=0 doors, and mines remain 1. Now I have 0 doors closed and 1 mine armed. But I need to disarm that last mine. How?If I press red from (0,1): (0,2). Then press yellow: (1,0). But now I have 1 door closed and 0 mines. But I need to open that door. However, pressing green would require 2 doors, which I don't have. So I'm stuck.Alternatively, from (2,1), if I press yellow: (3, -1). Wait, that doesn't make sense because mines can't be negative. So pressing yellow from (2,1) would result in m = 1 - 2 = -1, which is invalid. So pressing yellow from (2,1) is not possible because it would result in negative mines, which probably triggers a reset or is invalid.So maybe pressing green from (2,1) is the only option, leading to (0,1). Then, as before, stuck.Alternatively, from (2,1), pressing red: (2,2). Then from (2,2), I can press yellow: (3,0). Now I have 3 doors closed and 0 mines. But I need to open all doors. Pressing green from (3,0): (1,0). Then pressing green again would require 2 doors, so can't. Pressing red: (1,1). Then pressing yellow: (2,-1). Invalid. Hmm.This seems like a dead end. Maybe starting with green isn't the best move.Let me try starting with yellow from (3,3). So pressing yellow: (4,1). Now I have 4 doors closed and 1 mine armed.From (4,1), I can press green: (2,1). Because 4-2=2 doors, mines remain 1.From (2,1), pressing green: (0,1). Then stuck as before.Alternatively, from (4,1), press red: (4,2). Then press yellow: (5,0). Now 5 doors closed and 0 mines. But I need to open all doors. Pressing green from (5,0): (3,0). Then pressing green again: (1,0). Then stuck.Alternatively, from (4,1), press yellow: (5,-1). Invalid.Hmm, not helpful.What if I press red first? From (3,3), press red: (3,4). Then press yellow: (4,2). Then press yellow again: (5,0). Then press green: (3,0). Then press green: (1,0). Stuck.Alternatively, from (3,4), press green: (1,4). Then press yellow: (2,2). Then press yellow: (3,0). Then press green: (1,0). Stuck.This seems tricky.

If the equation f''(x)=0 has a real number solution x_{0}, then the point (x_{0},f(x_{0})) is called the \\"inflection point\\" of the function y=f(x). A student discovered that every cubic function has an inflection point, and this inflection point is the center of symmetry for the function.

The problem has two parts. First, I need to find the center of symmetry, which is the inflection point of this cubic function. Then, using that information, I have to calculate the sum ( fleft(frac{1}{2017}right) + fleft(frac{2}{2017}right) + dots + fleft(frac{2016}{2017}right) ).Starting with part (1): Finding the center of symmetry, which is the inflection point. I remember that for a cubic function, the inflection point is where the second derivative equals zero. So, I need to compute the first and second derivatives of ( f(x) ).First derivative, ( f'(x) ):( f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{1}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x + frac{1}{12}right) )Calculating term by term:- The derivative of ( frac{1}{3}x^3 ) is ( x^2 ).- The derivative of ( -frac{1}{2}x^2 ) is ( -x ).- The derivative of ( 2x ) is ( 2 ).- The derivative of ( frac{1}{12} ) is 0.So, ( f'(x) = x^2 - x + 2 ).Now, the second derivative, ( f''(x) ):( f''(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - x + 2) )Calculating term by term:- The derivative of ( x^2 ) is ( 2x ).- The derivative of ( -x ) is ( -1 ).- The derivative of 2 is 0.So, ( f''(x) = 2x - 1 ).To find the inflection point, set ( f''(x) = 0 ):( 2x - 1 = 0 )Solving for x:( 2x = 1 )( x = frac{1}{2} )So, the x-coordinate of the inflection point is ( frac{1}{2} ). Now, I need to find the corresponding y-coordinate by plugging this back into ( f(x) ).Calculating ( fleft(frac{1}{2}right) ):( fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{1}{3}left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 - frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + 2left(frac{1}{2}right) + frac{1}{12} )Let me compute each term step by step:1. ( frac{1}{3}left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 = frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{24} )2. ( -frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = -frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{4} = -frac{1}{8} )3. ( 2 times frac{1}{2} = 1 )4. The constant term is ( frac{1}{12} )Adding them all together:( frac{1}{24} - frac{1}{8} + 1 + frac{1}{12} )First, let's convert all fractions to have a common denominator, which is 24:- ( frac{1}{24} ) remains as is.- ( -frac{1}{8} = -frac{3}{24} )- ( 1 = frac{24}{24} )- ( frac{1}{12} = frac{2}{24} )Now, adding them:( frac{1}{24} - frac{3}{24} + frac{24}{24} + frac{2}{24} = frac{1 - 3 + 24 + 2}{24} = frac{24}{24} = 1 )So, ( fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = 1 ). Therefore, the inflection point is at ( left(frac{1}{2}, 1right) ), which is also the center of symmetry for the cubic function.Moving on to part (2): Calculating the sum ( S = fleft(frac{1}{2017}right) + fleft(frac{2}{2017}right) + dots + fleft(frac{2016}{2017}right) ).Since the function has a center of symmetry at ( left(frac{1}{2}, 1right) ), this implies that for any point ( x ), the function satisfies the property:( fleft(frac{1}{2} + hright) + fleft(frac{1}{2} - hright) = 2 times 1 = 2 )This is because the function is symmetric about the point ( left(frac{1}{2}, 1right) ). So, if I take two points equidistant from ( frac{1}{2} ), their function values add up to 2.Now, looking at the sum ( S ), it's the sum of ( fleft(frac{k}{2017}right) ) for ( k = 1 ) to ( 2016 ). Let's note that ( 2017 ) is an odd number, so ( 2016 = 2 times 1008 ). So, the terms can be paired as follows:( fleft(frac{1}{2017}right) + fleft(frac{2016}{2017}right) ),( fleft(frac{2}{2017}right) + fleft(frac{2015}{2017}right) ),...( fleft(frac{1008}{2017}right) + fleft(frac{1009}{2017}right) ).Each pair is of the form ( fleft(frac{k}{2017}right) + fleft(frac{2017 - k}{2017}right) ). Let's see if these pairs can be expressed in terms of the symmetry.Let me denote ( x = frac{k}{2017} ). Then, ( frac{2017 - k}{2017} = 1 - frac{k}{2017} = 1 - x ).So, each pair is ( f(x) + f(1 - x) ). Now, let's compute ( f(x) + f(1 - x) ) using the given function.Compute ( f(x) + f(1 - x) ):( f(x) = frac{1}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x + frac{1}{12} )( f(1 - x) = frac{1}{3}(1 - x)^3 - frac{1}{2}(1 - x)^2 + 2(1 - x) + frac{1}{12} )Let me expand ( f(1 - x) ):First, expand ( (1 - x)^3 ):( (1 - x)^3 = 1 - 3x + 3x^2 - x^3 )So, ( frac{1}{3}(1 - x)^3 = frac{1}{3} - x + x^2 - frac{1}{3}x^3 )Next, expand ( (1 - x)^2 ):( (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x^2 )So, ( -frac{1}{2}(1 - x)^2 = -frac{1}{2} + x - frac{1}{2}x^2 )Then, ( 2(1 - x) = 2 - 2x )Adding all terms together:( frac{1}{3} - x + x^2 - frac{1}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{2} + x - frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2 - 2x + frac{1}{12} )Now, let's combine like terms:Constant terms:( frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{2} + 2 + frac{1}{12} )Convert all to twelfths:( frac{4}{12} - frac{6}{12} + frac{24}{12} + frac{1}{12} = frac{4 - 6 + 24 + 1}{12} = frac{23}{12} )x terms:( -x + x - 2x = (-1 + 1 - 2)x = -2x )x^2 terms:( x^2 - frac{1}{2}x^2 = frac{1}{2}x^2 )x^3 terms:( -frac{1}{3}x^3 )So, putting it all together:( f(1 - x) = -frac{1}{3}x^3 + frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2x + frac{23}{12} )Now, compute ( f(x) + f(1 - x) ):( f(x) = frac{1}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x + frac{1}{12} )( f(1 - x) = -frac{1}{3}x^3 + frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2x + frac{23}{12} )Adding them term by term:- ( frac{1}{3}x^3 - frac{1}{3}x^3 = 0 )- ( -frac{1}{2}x^2 + frac{1}{2}x^2 = 0 )- ( 2x - 2x = 0 )- ( frac{1}{12} + frac{23}{12} = frac{24}{12} = 2 )So, ( f(x) + f(1 - x) = 2 ). That's a nice result! So, each pair ( fleft(frac{k}{2017}right) + fleft(frac{2017 - k}{2017}right) ) equals 2.Since there are 2016 terms in total, and each pair consists of 2 terms, the number of pairs is ( frac{2016}{2} = 1008 ). Therefore, the sum ( S ) is ( 1008 times 2 = 2016 ).Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Each pair adds up to 2, and there are 1008 pairs, so 1008 * 2 = 2016. That seems correct.Alternatively, thinking about the symmetry, since the function is symmetric about ( x = frac{1}{2} ), each pair ( f(a) + f(1 - a) = 2 ). So, for each ( a = frac{k}{2017} ), ( 1 - a = frac{2017 - k}{2017} ). So, each such pair adds to 2, and since we have 1008 such pairs, the total sum is 2016.Therefore, the answer to part (2) is 2016.**Final Answer**(1) The center of symmetry is boxed{left( frac{1}{2}, 1 right)}.(2) The sum is boxed{2016}."},{"question":"If the equation left(m-3right)x^{|m|+2}+2x-7=0 is a quadratic equation in terms of x, then m=______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: (m - 3)x^{|m| + 2} + 2x - 7 = 0. And I need to find the value of m such that this equation is quadratic in terms of x. Hmm, quadratic equations are of degree 2, right? So, the highest power of x should be 2. Let me break this down. The equation has two terms with x: one is (m - 3)x^{|m| + 2} and the other is 2x. The constant term is -7. For this to be a quadratic equation, the term with x must have an exponent of 2. That means |m| + 2 should equal 2. Wait, is that right? Let me think. If |m| + 2 = 2, then |m| = 0, which means m = 0. But hold on, if m = 0, then the coefficient of x^2 would be (0 - 3) which is -3. So, the equation becomes -3x^2 + 2x - 7 = 0. That is indeed a quadratic equation. But wait, is there another possibility? Because sometimes with absolute values, there can be two solutions. Let me check. If |m| + 2 = 2, then |m| = 0, so m must be 0. There's no other solution for |m| here because absolute value can't be negative. So, m has to be 0. But let me double-check. If m is 0, then the equation is quadratic. What if m is not 0? Let's say m is 1. Then |1| + 2 = 3, so the exponent would be 3, making it a cubic equation, which is not quadratic. Similarly, if m is -1, | -1 | + 2 = 3, again exponent 3. So, only when m is 0, the exponent becomes 2. Wait, but what if m is 3? Then the coefficient of x^{|m| + 2} becomes (3 - 3) = 0. So, the term with x^{|m| + 2} disappears, and the equation becomes 2x - 7 = 0, which is linear, not quadratic. So, m can't be 3. Therefore, the only value of m that makes the equation quadratic is 0. But just to make sure, let me plug m = 0 back into the original equation. It becomes (0 - 3)x^{0 + 2} + 2x - 7 = 0, which simplifies to -3x^2 + 2x - 7 = 0. Yep, that's definitely a quadratic equation. So, I think m must be 0. I don't see any other possibilities because any other m would either make the exponent too high or eliminate the quadratic term. **Final Answer**The value of ( m ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Even-numbered rolls belong to B.

Let me try to understand what's going on here.The problem is about two people, J. Silver and B. Bons, taking turns rolling a die. It says that even-numbered rolls belong to B. Bons, meaning he gets to roll on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., turns. Bons wins only if the total number of rolls, including the final successful one, is even. The probability of rolling a six is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a six is 5/6.So, the question is asking for the probability that the total number of rolls will be even, which would mean Bons wins.The method provided is called Method 2, and it defines p as the desired probability. It breaks down the event into two cases:1) Initially, J. Silver does not roll a 6, but B. Bons immediately rolls a 6. The probability of this is (5/6) * (1/6) = 5/36.2) Both Silver and Bons do not roll a 6 on their first tries. After this, the game essentially restarts, and B. Bons wins with probability p. The probability of this occurring is (5/6) * (5/6) * p = 25/36 * p.Then it sets up the equation p = 5/36 + 25/36 * p, and solves for p, getting p = 5/11.Hmm, okay, so let me try to wrap my head around this.First, let's clarify the structure of the game. It seems like they take turns rolling the die, starting with Silver, then Bons, then Silver, and so on. The game continues until someone rolls a six. If the total number of rolls when someone finally rolls a six is even, then Bons wins. If it's odd, Silver wins.So, the key here is that the game can end on the first roll (if Silver rolls a six), the second roll (if Bons rolls a six after Silver didn't), the third roll (if Silver rolls a six after both didn't in the first two), and so on.But since we're only interested in the probability that the total number of rolls is even, which would mean Bons wins, we need to calculate the probability that the game ends on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., rolls.Method 2 is using a recursive approach to model this. Let me try to rephrase it.Let p be the probability that Bons wins. There are two scenarios where Bons can win:1) Silver fails to roll a six on his first try (probability 5/6), and then Bons succeeds on his first try (probability 1/6). So, the probability of this happening is (5/6)*(1/6) = 5/36.2) Both Silver and Bons fail on their first tries (probability (5/6)*(5/6) = 25/36). Then, the game essentially restarts, and the probability that Bons wins from this point is still p. So, the probability of this scenario is 25/36 * p.Adding these two probabilities together gives the total probability p:p = 5/36 + 25/36 * pTo solve for p, we can subtract 25/36 * p from both sides:p - 25/36 * p = 5/36This simplifies to:(1 - 25/36) * p = 5/36Calculating 1 - 25/36 gives 11/36, so:(11/36) * p = 5/36Multiplying both sides by 36/11 gives:p = (5/36) * (36/11) = 5/11So, p = 5/11.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should approach this problem from another angle to verify.Another way to think about this is to model it as an infinite series. The probability that Bons wins can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities that the game ends on the 2nd roll, 4th roll, 6th roll, etc.So, the probability that the game ends on the 2nd roll is (5/6)*(1/6) = 5/36.The probability that the game ends on the 4th roll is (5/6)^3*(1/6). Wait, hold on, let me think. If it ends on the 4th roll, that means both Silver and Bons failed on their first two rolls, and then Bons succeeded on the 4th roll.So, the probability would be (5/6)^2*(5/6)^2*(1/6)? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.Wait, no, each pair of rolls (Silver and Bons) is a trial. So, if the game ends on the 2nd roll, that's one trial. If it ends on the 4th roll, that's two trials. Each trial consists of Silver failing and Bons failing, except for the last trial where Bons succeeds.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of turns. Each turn consists of Silver rolling and then Bons rolling. So, each turn has a probability of (5/6)*(5/6) = 25/36 of continuing, and a probability of (5/6)*(1/6) + (1/6)*1 of ending. Wait, no, actually, the game can end on Silver's roll or Bons's roll.Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a geometric distribution.But since we're only interested in the cases where the game ends on an even roll, which corresponds to Bons's turn, we can model it as follows.The probability that the game ends on the nth roll, where n is even, is equal to the probability that the first n-1 rolls were not sixes, and the nth roll is a six.But since the turns alternate between Silver and Bons, the nth roll being a six would mean that if n is even, it's Bons's turn, and if n is odd, it's Silver's turn.So, the probability that the game ends on an even roll is the sum over k=1 to infinity of the probability that the game ends on the 2k-th roll.So, for each k, the probability that the game ends on the 2k-th roll is (5/6)^(2k - 1) * (1/6). Wait, let me check.Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because on each turn, both Silver and Bons have a chance to roll. So, the game can end on the first roll (Silver), second roll (Bons), third roll (Silver), fourth roll (Bons), etc.Therefore, the probability that the game ends on the 2k-th roll is the probability that the first 2k - 1 rolls were not sixes, and the 2k-th roll is a six.But actually, that's not quite accurate either because Silver and Bons alternate. So, for the game to end on the 2k-th roll, it means that Silver failed on his k-th roll, and then Bons succeeded on his k-th roll.So, the probability would be (5/6)^(2k - 1) * (1/6). Wait, no, because each pair of rolls (Silver and Bons) is a trial. So, for the game to end on the 2k-th roll, both Silver and Bons must have failed on their first k-1 rolls, and then on the k-th trial, Silver fails and Bons succeeds.Therefore, the probability is [(5/6)^2]^(k - 1) * (5/6) * (1/6).Simplifying, that's (25/36)^(k - 1) * (5/36).Therefore, the total probability p is the sum from k=1 to infinity of (25/36)^(k - 1) * (5/36).This is a geometric series with first term a = 5/36 and common ratio r = 25/36.The sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r), so:p = (5/36) / (1 - 25/36) = (5/36) / (11/36) = 5/11.Okay, so that's the same result as before. So, that seems to confirm that p = 5/11.Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a Markov chain with states representing whose turn it is. But maybe that's overcomplicating it.Wait, another approach: Let's denote p as the probability that Bons wins. On the first turn, Silver goes first. The probability that Silver rolls a six is 1/6, in which case Bons loses. The probability that Silver doesn't roll a six is 5/6, and then it's Bons's turn.On Bons's turn, the probability that he rolls a six is 1/6, in which case Bons wins. The probability that he doesn't roll a six is 5/6, and then it's Silver's turn again, and the situation resets.So, we can model this as:p = probability that Bons wins.From Silver's turn:- Silver rolls a six: probability 1/6, Bons loses.- Silver doesn't roll a six: probability 5/6, then it's Bons's turn.From Bons's turn:- Bons rolls a six: probability 1/6, Bons wins.- Bons doesn't roll a six: probability 5/6, then it's Silver's turn again.So, the probability p can be expressed as:p = probability that Silver fails * [probability that Bons succeeds + probability that Bons fails * p]Wait, let me write that out:p = (5/6) * [ (1/6) + (5/6) * p ]Wait, that might not be the exact way. Let me think.Actually, starting from Silver's turn, the probability that Bons wins is:- Silver fails (5/6), then Bons can win either by succeeding (1/6) or by failing (5/6) and then the game restarts, giving Bons another chance with probability p.Wait, no, if Bons fails, then it's Silver's turn again, so the game restarts from Silver's turn, not Bons's turn.Wait, maybe I need to model this with two states: one where it's Silver's turn, and one where it's Bons's turn.Let me denote:- p_S: probability that Bons wins starting from Silver's turn.- p_B: probability that Bons wins starting from Bons's turn.Our target is p_S, since the game starts with Silver's turn.From Silver's turn:- Silver rolls a six: probability 1/6, Bons loses, so p_S contribution is 0.- Silver doesn't roll a six: probability 5/6, then it's Bons's turn, so the probability becomes p_B.Therefore, p_S = (5/6) * p_B.From Bons's turn:- Bons rolls a six: probability 1/6, Bons wins, so p_B contribution is 1/6.- Bons doesn't roll a six: probability 5/6, then it's Silver's turn again, so the probability becomes p_S.Therefore, p_B = (1/6) + (5/6) * p_S.Now, we have a system of two equations:1) p_S = (5/6) * p_B2) p_B = (1/6) + (5/6) * p_SWe can substitute equation 1 into equation 2.From equation 1: p_B = (6/5) * p_SPlugging into equation 2:(6/5) * p_S = (1/6) + (5/6) * p_SMultiply both sides by 30 to eliminate denominators:30*(6/5)*p_S = 30*(1/6) + 30*(5/6)*p_SSimplify:(36)*p_S = 5 + 25*p_SSubtract 25*p_S from both sides:11*p_S = 5Therefore, p_S = 5/11.So, that's consistent with the previous results.Wait, so this method also gives p = 5/11.Therefore, regardless of the approach—whether using recursion, infinite series, or state-based probability—we arrive at the same answer, p = 5/11.Just to make sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose the game only went for two rolls. What's the probability that Bons wins?Well, Silver fails (5/6), then Bons succeeds (1/6). So, 5/6 * 1/6 = 5/36, which is approximately 0.1389.If we go to four rolls, the probability would be (5/6)^2 * (5/6) * (1/6) = (25/36) * (5/36) = 125/1296 ≈ 0.0965.Adding these together, 5/36 + 125/1296 ≈ 0.1389 + 0.0965 ≈ 0.2354.Continuing this, the total probability converges to 5/11 ≈ 0.4545.So, that seems reasonable.Alternatively, if I consider the ratio of Bons's winning probability to Silver's. Since Silver goes first, one might think that Silver has an advantage, but since Bons only wins on even rolls, it's a bit different.Wait, actually, in this case, the probability that Bons wins is 5/11, and the probability that Silver wins is 6/11, since 5/11 + 6/11 = 11/11 = 1.Wait, let me check that. If p = 5/11 is the probability that Bons wins, then the probability that Silver wins is 1 - 5/11 = 6/11.But let's see, if we model Silver's winning probability similarly.Let q be the probability that Silver wins.From Silver's turn:- Silver rolls a six: probability 1/6, Silver wins.- Silver doesn't roll a six: probability 5/6, then it's Bons's turn.From Bons's turn:- Bons rolls a six: probability 1/6, Bons wins, so Silver loses.- Bons doesn't roll a six: probability 5/6, then it's Silver's turn again.So, q can be expressed as:q = (1/6) + (5/6) * [ (5/6) * q ]Because if Silver doesn't roll a six (5/6), then Bons gets a turn. If Bons doesn't roll a six (5/6), then it's Silver's turn again, with probability q.Therefore, q = 1/6 + (5/6)*(5/6)*q = 1/6 + (25/36)*qSolving for q:q - (25/36)*q = 1/6(11/36)*q = 1/6q = (1/6)*(36/11) = 6/11So, q = 6/11, which is consistent with p = 5/11.Therefore, the probability that Bons wins is 5/11, and Silver wins with probability 6/11.That makes sense because Silver has the first chance to roll, so he has a slightly higher probability of winning.Wait, but hold on, in this problem, Bons only wins if the total number of rolls is even. So, does that mean that the probability of the game ending on an even roll is 5/11?Yes, because p is defined as the probability that Bons wins, which corresponds to the game ending on an even roll.Therefore, the probability that the total number of rolls is even is 5/11.So, after going through multiple approaches—recursive reasoning, infinite series, state-based probability—I consistently arrive at the conclusion that the probability is 5/11.I think that solidifies the answer.**Final Answer**The probability that the total number of rolls will be even is boxed{dfrac{5}{11}}."},{"question":"The quadratic equation ( x^2 + 4x + 8 = 0 ) has roots ( a ) and ( b ). Find a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients whose roots are ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{1}{b} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation ( x^2 + 4x + 8 = 0 ) with roots ( a ) and ( b ). I need to find another quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients whose roots are ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{1}{b} ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a quadratic equation ( x^2 + px + q = 0 ), the sum of the roots is ( -p ) and the product is ( q ). So, in this case, the sum of the roots ( a + b ) should be ( -4 ) because the coefficient of ( x ) is 4. And the product ( ab ) should be 8 because the constant term is 8. Let me write that down:( a + b = -4 )( ab = 8 )Now, I need to find a quadratic polynomial whose roots are ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{1}{b} ). Let me denote this new polynomial as ( x^2 + mx + n = 0 ). Then, the sum of the new roots will be ( -m ) and the product will be ( n ).So, the sum of the new roots is ( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} ). To compute this, I can combine the fractions:( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{b + a}{ab} )I already know ( a + b = -4 ) and ( ab = 8 ), so substituting these values in:( frac{-4}{8} = -frac{1}{2} )So, the sum of the new roots is ( -frac{1}{2} ), which means ( -m = -frac{1}{2} ), so ( m = frac{1}{2} ). Hmm, but the problem specifies that the polynomial should have integer coefficients. ( frac{1}{2} ) is not an integer, so I need to adjust for that.Next, the product of the new roots is ( frac{1}{a} times frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{ab} ). Since ( ab = 8 ), this becomes ( frac{1}{8} ). So, ( n = frac{1}{8} ). Again, not an integer. Hmm, so both the sum and the product lead to fractions, which is a problem because we need integer coefficients.I think the way to handle this is to scale the polynomial so that all coefficients become integers. If I have a polynomial with roots ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{1}{b} ), it can be written as:( (x - frac{1}{a})(x - frac{1}{b}) = 0 )Expanding this, I get:( x^2 - left( frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} right)x + frac{1}{ab} = 0 )Which is:( x^2 - left( -frac{1}{2} right)x + frac{1}{8} = 0 )Wait, that's:( x^2 + frac{1}{2}x + frac{1}{8} = 0 )But as I saw earlier, the coefficients are fractions. To make them integers, I can multiply the entire equation by 8, which is the least common denominator of the fractions involved.Multiplying each term by 8:( 8x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0 )Let me check if this works. The new polynomial is ( 8x^2 + 4x + 1 ). Let's verify if ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{1}{b} ) are indeed the roots.If I plug ( x = frac{1}{a} ) into the polynomial:( 8left( frac{1}{a} right)^2 + 4left( frac{1}{a} right) + 1 )Simplify:( frac{8}{a^2} + frac{4}{a} + 1 )I need to see if this equals zero. Let's express everything in terms of ( a ). Since ( a ) is a root of the original equation, ( a^2 + 4a + 8 = 0 ), so ( a^2 = -4a - 8 ). Let me substitute that into the expression:( frac{8}{-4a - 8} + frac{4}{a} + 1 )Simplify the first term:( frac{8}{-4(a + 2)} = -frac{2}{a + 2} )So, the expression becomes:( -frac{2}{a + 2} + frac{4}{a} + 1 )Hmm, this doesn't look like it's simplifying to zero. Maybe I made a mistake in my approach.Wait, perhaps instead of multiplying the polynomial by 8, I should consider another method. Maybe using the reciprocal roots formula.I recall that if a quadratic equation has roots ( a ) and ( b ), then the equation with roots ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{1}{b} ) can be found by reversing the coefficients. That is, if the original equation is ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), then the reciprocal roots equation is ( cx^2 + bx + a = 0 ). Let me try that.Given the original equation ( x^2 + 4x + 8 = 0 ), reversing the coefficients gives ( 8x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0 ). Wait, that's the same polynomial I got earlier by scaling. So, that must be the correct one.But when I tried plugging in ( frac{1}{a} ), I didn't get zero. Maybe I made an error in substitution.Let me try again. Let me compute ( 8x^2 + 4x + 1 ) at ( x = frac{1}{a} ):( 8left( frac{1}{a} right)^2 + 4left( frac{1}{a} right) + 1 = frac{8}{a^2} + frac{4}{a} + 1 )Since ( a ) satisfies ( a^2 + 4a + 8 = 0 ), we can write ( a^2 = -4a - 8 ). Substitute this into the expression:( frac{8}{-4a - 8} + frac{4}{a} + 1 = frac{8}{-4(a + 2)} + frac{4}{a} + 1 = -frac{2}{a + 2} + frac{4}{a} + 1 )Hmm, this still doesn't look like zero. Maybe I need to manipulate it differently. Let me combine the terms:First, let me write all terms with denominator ( a(a + 2) ):( -frac{2a}{a(a + 2)} + frac{4(a + 2)}{a(a + 2)} + frac{a(a + 2)}{a(a + 2)} )Simplify each numerator:- ( -2a )- ( 4(a + 2) = 4a + 8 )- ( a(a + 2) = a^2 + 2a )Combine all numerators:( (-2a) + (4a + 8) + (a^2 + 2a) = (-2a + 4a + 2a) + (8) + (a^2) = 4a + 8 + a^2 )But from the original equation, ( a^2 = -4a - 8 ), so substitute that:( 4a + 8 + (-4a - 8) = 0 )Ah! So, the numerator becomes zero, meaning the entire expression is zero. Therefore, ( frac{1}{a} ) is indeed a root of ( 8x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0 ). Similarly, ( frac{1}{b} ) will also satisfy the equation.So, even though my initial substitution seemed messy, it does work out because the numerator simplifies to zero using the original equation. Therefore, the quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients and roots ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{1}{b} ) is ( 8x^2 + 4x + 1 ).Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:1. Found the sum and product of the original roots ( a ) and ( b ).2. Calculated the sum and product of the reciprocal roots ( frac{1}{a} ) and ( frac{1}{b} ).3. Noted that these led to fractional coefficients, so decided to scale the polynomial.4. Remembered that reversing coefficients gives the reciprocal roots equation, which in this case also required scaling.5. Verified by substitution, which initially looked confusing but simplified correctly.So, I think I'm confident that ( 8x^2 + 4x + 1 ) is the correct polynomial.**Final Answer**The quadratic polynomial is boxed{8x^2 + 4x + 1}."},{"question":"If int_{0}^{T} x^2 dx = 9, find the value of the constant T.","answer":"First, I need to evaluate the integral of ( x^2 ) from 0 to ( T ). The integral of ( x^2 ) with respect to ( x ) is ( frac{x^3}{3} ).Next, I'll apply the limits of integration. Substituting ( T ) into the antiderivative gives ( frac{T^3}{3} ), and substituting 0 gives 0. So, the integral simplifies to ( frac{T^3}{3} ).According to the problem, this integral equals 9. Therefore, I set up the equation ( frac{T^3}{3} = 9 ).To solve for ( T ), I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in ( T^3 = 27 ).Finally, taking the cube root of both sides gives ( T = 3 )."},{"question":"Alice and Basilio are playing the following game; from a bag containing 1331 coins initially, they take turns taking coins. Alice goes first and takes 1 coin, and each subsequent turn, a player can take either the same number of coins as the other player took on their last turn, or one more. The player who cannot make a move according to the rules loses. Which player can ensure a win regardless of the other’s moves?","answer":"Okay, so Alice and Basilio are playing this coin game. There are 1331 coins in the bag to start with. Alice goes first and takes 1 coin. Then, on each subsequent turn, a player can take either the same number of coins as the other player took last time or one more. The person who can't make a move according to the rules loses. I need to figure out which player can ensure a win, regardless of the other's moves.Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a turn-based game with specific move options. The key here is that each player can take either the same number of coins as the opponent took last turn or one more. So, the number of coins taken each turn can either stay the same or increase by one. That seems similar to some kind of incrementing game.Since Alice starts by taking 1 coin, Basilio can respond by taking either 1 or 2 coins. Then Alice can take the same number as Basilio's last move or one more, and so on. The game continues until someone can't take the required number of coins, meaning there aren't enough coins left, and that person loses.I think this might be a variant of the game of Nim, but with specific rules about how many coins can be taken each turn. In Nim, players can take any number of coins from a pile, but here the options are more restricted. So, maybe the strategy is different.Let me consider smaller numbers first to see if I can find a pattern or a winning strategy.Suppose there are just 1 coin. Alice takes it, and Basilio can't move, so Alice wins. That's straightforward.If there are 2 coins. Alice takes 1, then Basilio can take 1 or 2. If Basilio takes 1, then Alice can take the remaining 1 and win. If Basilio takes 2, he takes the last coin and Alice can't move, so Basilio wins. But wait, can Basilio take 2? Because the rule is you can take the same number as the opponent's last move or one more. Alice took 1, so Basilio can take 1 or 2. So, if he takes 2, he can win immediately. So, in this case, Basilio can win if he takes 2.Wait, so with 2 coins, Basilio can win by taking 2. So, depending on the number of coins, the outcome changes.Let's try 3 coins. Alice takes 1, then Basilio can take 1 or 2.Case 1: Basilio takes 1. Then there are 1 coin left. Alice can take 1 and win.Case 2: Basilio takes 2. Then there is 0 coins left, so Alice can't move and Basilio wins.So, Basilio can choose to take 2 and win. So, with 3 coins, Basilio can win.Wait, so with 2 and 3 coins, Basilio can win. What about 4 coins?Alice takes 1, Basilio can take 1 or 2.Case 1: Basilio takes 1. Then 2 coins left. Alice can take 1 or 2.If Alice takes 1, then 1 coin left. Basilio can take 1 and win.If Alice takes 2, she takes the last two and wins.So, if Basilio takes 1, Alice can choose to take 2 and win. So, Basilio doesn't want to take 1.Case 2: Basilio takes 2. Then 1 coin left. Alice can take 1 and win.So, regardless of what Basilio does, Alice can win. So, with 4 coins, Alice can win.Hmm, interesting. So, 1 coin: Alice wins, 2 coins: Basilio wins, 3 coins: Basilio wins, 4 coins: Alice wins.Let me try 5 coins.Alice takes 1, Basilio can take 1 or 2.Case 1: Basilio takes 1. Then 3 coins left. Alice can take 1 or 2.If Alice takes 1, then 2 coins left. Basilio can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 1, 1 coin left. Alice takes 1 and wins.If Basilio takes 2, he takes the last two and wins.So, if Alice takes 1, Basilio can choose to take 2 and win.If Alice takes 2, then 1 coin left. Basilio takes 1 and wins.So, if Basilio takes 1, Alice is forced into a losing position.Case 2: Basilio takes 2. Then 2 coins left. Alice can take 2 and win.So, if Basilio takes 2, Alice can win. So, Basilio would prefer to take 1, forcing Alice into a losing position.Therefore, with 5 coins, Basilio can win.Wait, so 5 coins: Basilio can win.Wait, let me recap:1: Alice2: Basilio3: Basilio4: Alice5: BasilioHmm, so maybe the pattern is that Alice can win when the number of coins is 1 mod 3? Wait, 1, 4, 7... Let's check 6 coins.6 coins:Alice takes 1, Basilio can take 1 or 2.Case 1: Basilio takes 1. Then 4 coins left. Alice can take 1 or 2.If Alice takes 1, 3 coins left. Basilio can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 1, 2 coins left. Alice can take 1 or 2.If Alice takes 1, 1 coin left. Basilio takes 1 and wins.If Alice takes 2, she takes the last two and wins.So, if Basilio takes 1, Alice can take 2 and win.If Alice takes 2, 2 coins left. Basilio can take 2 and win.So, if Basilio takes 1, Alice can choose to take 2 and win.Case 2: Basilio takes 2. Then 3 coins left. Alice can take 2 or 3.If Alice takes 2, 1 coin left. Basilio takes 1 and wins.If Alice takes 3, she takes the last three and wins.So, if Basilio takes 2, Alice can choose to take 3 and win.Wait, but can Alice take 3? Because the rule is she can take the same number as Basilio took last turn or one more. Basilio took 2, so Alice can take 2 or 3.So, if she takes 3, she can win. So, Basilio taking 2 is not good for him.Therefore, Basilio would prefer to take 1, but in that case, Alice can take 2 and win.Wait, so in both cases, Alice can win. So, with 6 coins, Alice can win.Wait, so 6 coins: Alice can win.Wait, so 1: Alice, 2: Basilio, 3: Basilio, 4: Alice, 5: Basilio, 6: Alice.Hmm, so the pattern is Alice wins when n ≡ 1 mod 3? 1, 4, 7... But 6 is 0 mod 3, but she still can win.Wait, maybe not. Let's try 7 coins.7 coins:Alice takes 1, Basilio can take 1 or 2.Case 1: Basilio takes 1. Then 5 coins left. Alice can take 1 or 2.If Alice takes 1, 4 coins left. Basilio can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 1, 3 coins left. Alice can take 1 or 2.If Alice takes 1, 2 coins left. Basilio can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 1, 1 coin left. Alice takes 1 and wins.If Basilio takes 2, he takes the last two and wins.So, if Basilio takes 1, Alice can take 2 and win.If Alice takes 2, 2 coins left. Basilio can take 2 and win.So, if Basilio takes 1, Alice can choose to take 2 and win.Case 2: Basilio takes 2. Then 4 coins left. Alice can take 2 or 3.If Alice takes 2, 2 coins left. Basilio can take 2 and win.If Alice takes 3, she takes the last three and wins.So, if Basilio takes 2, Alice can choose to take 3 and win.Wait, so regardless of Basilio's move, Alice can win. So, 7 coins: Alice can win.Wait, so 7 is 1 mod 3, 6 is 0 mod 3, but both Alice can win. Hmm, maybe my initial pattern was wrong.Wait, let's see:n : winner1: Alice2: Basilio3: Basilio4: Alice5: Basilio6: Alice7: AliceWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to think differently.Alternatively, perhaps the losing positions are when n is a multiple of 3.Wait, 3 coins: Basilio can win, which is a multiple of 3.6 coins: Alice can win, which is a multiple of 3. Hmm, that contradicts.Wait, maybe it's not about the total number of coins, but about the number of coins modulo something else.Alternatively, maybe it's about the Grundy numbers or something in combinatorial game theory.Wait, Grundy numbers assign a value to each position, and the Grundy number is the mex (minimum excludant) of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.In this game, from a position with n coins, the next player can move to n - k or n - (k+1), where k is the number of coins the previous player took.But since the number of coins taken can vary each time, depending on the previous move, it's a bit more complicated.Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as an octal game or something similar.Alternatively, maybe it's a variant of the Fibonacci Nim game, where the maximum number of coins you can take is related to the previous move.Wait, in Fibonacci Nim, the maximum number you can take is twice the previous move, but here it's either the same or one more. So, it's a different rule.Alternatively, maybe it's similar to the game where each move can be 1 or 2 more than the previous, but in this case, it's same or one more.Wait, maybe I can model this as a sequence where each term is the previous term or previous term +1.Wait, but the number of coins is decreasing each time, so it's more like a subtraction game with variable subtraction.Wait, perhaps I can think recursively. Let's define a position as losing if the previous player can force a win regardless of what the current player does.Wait, actually, in combinatorial game theory, a position is a losing position if every move leads to a winning position for the opponent.So, if I can define P-positions (previous player can force a win) and N-positions (next player can force a win).But in this case, the moves are dependent on the previous move, so it's not a standard impartial game.Wait, actually, this game is not impartial because the moves available depend on the previous move, which is determined by the opponent. So, it's a partisan game.Hmm, that complicates things.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the maximum number of coins that can be taken in each turn.Since Alice starts by taking 1, Basilio can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 1, then Alice can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 2, then Alice can take 2 or 3.Wait, so the number of coins taken can increase each turn, but not decrease.Wait, so the game is such that the number of coins taken can only stay the same or increase by 1 each turn.So, starting from 1, the possible moves are 1 or 2, then from there, 1, 2, or 3, etc.But actually, no, because each move is dependent on the previous move. So, if the previous move was k, then the next move can be k or k+1.So, the number of coins taken can either stay the same or increase by 1 each turn.Therefore, the sequence of coins taken is non-decreasing, with each term being either equal to the previous or one more.So, the game is a sequence like 1,1,1,... or 1,2,2,... or 1,2,3,... etc., until the coins run out.Therefore, the total number of coins taken is the sum of such a sequence.Wait, so the game can be thought of as building a sequence where each term is at least as big as the previous, and each term is either equal or one more than the previous.So, the total number of coins is 1331. We need to see if Alice can force the game to end on Basilio's turn.Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many coins are taken each round.Wait, each full round consists of Alice and Basilio each taking some coins. The number of coins taken in a round can vary.Wait, but the number of coins taken alternates between Alice and Basilio, with each player's move depending on the previous move.This seems complicated.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the maximum number of coins that can be taken in each turn.Since each turn can take either the same or one more than the previous, the maximum number of coins that can be taken in the k-th turn is k.Wait, no, because the number of coins taken can only increase by 1 each time.Wait, actually, starting from 1, the next can be 1 or 2, then from there, 1,2, or 3, etc.Wait, no, actually, each move is dependent only on the immediately previous move.So, if Alice takes 1, Basilio can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 1, Alice can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 2, Alice can take 2 or 3.So, the number of coins taken can either stay the same or increase by 1 each turn.Therefore, the number of coins taken is a non-decreasing sequence where each term is either equal to the previous or one more.Therefore, the number of coins taken in each turn can be represented as a sequence like 1,1,1,... or 1,2,2,... or 1,2,3,..., etc.Therefore, the total number of coins is the sum of such a sequence.Wait, so the game is equivalent to partitioning the number 1331 into a sequence where each term is at least as big as the previous, and each term is either equal or one more than the previous.Therefore, the game is about building such a partition, and the player who cannot make a move loses.So, the question is, can Alice force the game to end on Basilio's turn?Alternatively, maybe the key is to realize that the game is equivalent to a game where the number of coins is a triangular number.Wait, because the maximum number of coins that can be taken in n turns is the sum 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2.But in this game, the number of coins taken can be less than that, as players can choose to take the same number as the previous move.Wait, but the maximum coins taken in n turns is n(n+1)/2, and the minimum is n (if each player takes 1 each time).But in our case, the number of coins is fixed at 1331, so we need to see how the game can proceed.Wait, maybe it's useful to think about the game in terms of the maximum number of moves.If both players always take the minimum number of coins (i.e., same as the previous move), then the number of coins taken each turn remains 1, so the game would take 1331 moves, which is not practical.Alternatively, if both players always take one more each time, the number of coins taken would be 1,2,3,...,n until the sum exceeds 1331.Wait, the sum 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2. So, solving n(n+1)/2 ≈ 1331.Let me compute n such that n(n+1)/2 ≈ 1331.n^2 ≈ 2662, so n ≈ sqrt(2662) ≈ 51.6. So, n=51 gives 51*52/2=1326, which is close to 1331. Then n=52 gives 52*53/2=1378, which is more than 1331.So, the maximum number of turns if both players keep increasing by 1 each time is 51 turns, taking a total of 1326 coins, leaving 5 coins.Wait, but in reality, players can choose to take the same number as the previous move, so the game can be extended beyond 51 turns.Wait, but if both players keep increasing, the game would end in 51 turns with 5 coins left. Then, the next player can take 51 or 52 coins, but there are only 5 left, so they can't make a move, so they lose.Wait, but in reality, the players can choose to take the same number as the previous move, so the game can be prolonged.Wait, maybe the key is to realize that the game can be forced into a state where the opponent is left with a number of coins that is a triangular number.Wait, because triangular numbers are the sum 1+2+3+...+n, and if a player can leave the opponent with a triangular number, they can force the opponent into a losing position.Wait, let me think. If the total number of coins is a triangular number, then the second player can mirror the first player's moves to maintain the triangular number.Wait, but in this case, the starting number is 1331, which is not a triangular number.Wait, 51*52/2=1326, which is the closest triangular number below 1331. So, 1331-1326=5.So, if Alice can take 5 coins on her first move, she can leave Basilio with a triangular number. But she can't, because she has to take 1 coin first.Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.Alternatively, maybe the key is to realize that the game is equivalent to a Nim heap where the allowed moves are determined by the previous move.Wait, but since the allowed moves depend on the previous move, it's not a standard Nim game.Alternatively, perhaps the game can be broken down into independent subgames, but I don't see how.Wait, another approach: Let's think about the game as a sequence of moves where each move is either equal to or one more than the previous.So, starting from 1, the possible sequences are:1,1,1,...1,1,2,...1,2,2,...1,2,3,...1,2,3,4,...and so on.Each such sequence corresponds to a way of partitioning the total number of coins.The player who cannot make a move loses, so the player who takes the last coin wins.Wait, actually, no, because if you take the last coin, the next player cannot move and loses, so taking the last coin is a win.Therefore, the goal is to take the last coin.So, the question is, can Alice force the game such that Basilio is left without a move.Given that, maybe the key is to find whether 1331 is a winning or losing position.Wait, but since the game is dependent on the previous move, it's not straightforward.Wait, maybe I can model this as a variant of the game where each move is determined by the previous move, so the game is a series of moves where each move is either equal to or one more than the previous.Therefore, the game can be represented as a sequence of moves: m1, m2, m3, ..., where m1=1, and each mi = mi-1 or mi-1 +1.The total sum of mi should be less than or equal to 1331, and the player who cannot make a move (because the sum would exceed 1331) loses.So, the game is a series of moves where each move is non-decreasing by at most 1 each time, starting from 1.Therefore, the total number of coins is the sum of such a sequence.So, the question is, can Alice force the sum to reach 1331 on Basilio's turn.Alternatively, perhaps it's useful to think in terms of the maximum number of coins that can be taken in a certain number of moves.Wait, let's think about the maximum number of coins that can be taken in k moves.If each move increases by 1, the maximum is 1+2+3+...+k = k(k+1)/2.If each move stays the same, the maximum is k*1 = k.But in reality, the number of coins taken can be anywhere between k and k(k+1)/2.But in our case, the total coins are fixed at 1331, so we need to see how the game can be played.Wait, maybe the key is to realize that the game can be divided into \\"blocks\\" where each block is a pair of moves: Alice and Basilio each taking some coins.But since the number of coins taken can vary, it's not clear.Alternatively, maybe the key is to realize that the game is equivalent to a game where the number of coins is reduced by a certain amount each round, and the player who reduces it to zero wins.But I'm not sure.Wait, another approach: Let's think about the game in terms of the number of coins remaining after each pair of moves.Since Alice starts, she takes 1, then Basilio takes 1 or 2, then Alice takes the same or one more, etc.So, after each pair of moves, the number of coins reduces by some amount.But the exact amount depends on the players' choices.Wait, maybe the key is to realize that the game can be forced into a state where the number of coins remaining is a multiple of 3, or something like that.Wait, let's try to see:If the number of coins is a multiple of 3, then the second player can always respond in a way that maintains the multiple of 3.Wait, for example, if there are 3 coins, Basilio can take 2, leaving 1, which is not a multiple of 3. Hmm, maybe not.Wait, maybe not 3, but another number.Wait, let's think recursively.Let me define f(n) as the winning status of a position with n coins.If n=0, the player to move loses.If n=1, the player to move takes 1 and wins.If n=2, the player to move can take 1 or 2. If they take 2, they win. So, n=2 is a winning position.Wait, but in our game, the first move is fixed as 1, so maybe the initial move is different.Wait, actually, in our specific game, Alice must take 1 on her first move. So, the game starts with 1331 coins, Alice takes 1, leaving 1330.Then Basilio can take 1 or 2, and so on.So, maybe we can model the game as starting from 1330 coins, with Basilio to move, and the previous move was 1.So, the game is equivalent to a game starting with 1330 coins, and the previous move was 1, so the next player can take 1 or 2.Therefore, we can think of the game as starting from 1330, with the previous move being 1.So, to analyze this, maybe we can define a function f(n, k), where n is the number of coins left, and k is the number of coins the previous player took. Then, f(n, k) is true if the current player can force a win.But this might get complicated, but let's try.Base case: If n=0, the current player loses.If n < k, the current player cannot take k coins, so they lose.Otherwise, the current player can take k or k+1 coins.So, f(n, k) = not f(n - k, k) or not f(n - (k+1), k+1)Wait, because if the current player can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position, then the current position is a winning position.So, f(n, k) = (if n >=k and not f(n -k, k)) or (if n >=k+1 and not f(n - (k+1), k+1))Therefore, f(n, k) is true if either taking k coins leads to a losing position for the opponent, or taking k+1 coins leads to a losing position.So, starting from f(1330, 1), we can compute whether Basilio can win.But computing this recursively for 1330 is impractical manually.Alternatively, maybe we can find a pattern or formula.Wait, let's try small n and k to see if we can find a pattern.Let's fix k=1:f(n,1) = not f(n-1,1) or not f(n-2,2)Similarly, f(n,2) = not f(n-2,2) or not f(n-3,3)Wait, this seems recursive.Alternatively, maybe we can find that f(n,1) is true if n is not a multiple of 3.Wait, let's test:n=1, k=1: f(1,1)= not f(0,1)= not false= truen=2, k=1: f(2,1)= not f(1,1) or not f(0,2)= not true or not false= false or true= trueWait, but if n=2, k=1, the current player can take 2 and win, so f(2,1)=true.Wait, n=3, k=1: f(3,1)= not f(2,1) or not f(1,2)f(2,1)=true, so not f(2,1)=falsef(1,2)= not f(-1,2) or not f(-2,3)= false or false= falseSo, not f(1,2)=trueTherefore, f(3,1)=false or true= trueBut in reality, with 3 coins, the current player can take 2 and win, so f(3,1)=true.Wait, maybe my recursive formula is not correct.Wait, actually, the formula should be f(n,k)= (if n >=k and not f(n -k, k)) or (if n >=k+1 and not f(n - (k+1), k+1))So, for n=3, k=1:f(3,1)= (3>=1 and not f(2,1)) or (3>=2 and not f(1,2))We have f(2,1)=true, so not f(2,1)=falsef(1,2)= (1>=2? No) or (1>=3? No)= falseSo, not f(1,2)=trueTherefore, f(3,1)=false or true= trueWhich is correct, because with 3 coins, the current player can take 2 and win.Wait, let's try n=4, k=1:f(4,1)= (4>=1 and not f(3,1)) or (4>=2 and not f(2,2))f(3,1)=true, so not f(3,1)=falsef(2,2)= (2>=2 and not f(0,2)) or (2>=3? No)= not f(0,2)=trueSo, not f(2,2)=falseTherefore, f(4,1)=false or false= falseWait, but with 4 coins, the current player can take 1, leaving 3, which we saw is a winning position for the opponent. Or take 2, leaving 2, which is also a winning position for the opponent.Wait, so f(4,1)=false, meaning the current player cannot force a win, so it's a losing position.Wait, but earlier, when I thought about 4 coins, I thought Alice could win. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, in the original problem, Alice starts with 1, leaving 1330. So, in the case of 4 coins, starting from 4, with previous move 1, the current player (Basilio) can take 1 or 2.If Basilio takes 1, leaving 3, which is a winning position for Alice.If Basilio takes 2, leaving 2, which is a winning position for Alice.So, in both cases, Alice can win, meaning that Basilio is in a losing position.Therefore, f(4,1)=false, which aligns with our calculation.So, n=4, k=1: losing position.Similarly, n=5, k=1:f(5,1)= (5>=1 and not f(4,1)) or (5>=2 and not f(3,2))f(4,1)=false, so not f(4,1)=truef(3,2)= (3>=2 and not f(1,2)) or (3>=3 and not f(0,3))f(1,2)=false, so not f(1,2)=truef(0,3)=false, so not f(0,3)=trueTherefore, f(3,2)=true or true= trueSo, not f(3,2)=falseTherefore, f(5,1)=true or false= trueSo, f(5,1)=true, meaning Basilio can win.Which makes sense, because with 5 coins, Basilio can take 2, leaving 3, which is a winning position for him.Wait, no, if Basilio takes 2, leaving 3, then Alice can take 2 and win. Wait, maybe I'm confused.Wait, in n=5, k=1:Basilio can take 1 or 2.If he takes 1, leaving 4, which is a losing position for Alice.If he takes 2, leaving 3, which is a winning position for Alice.So, Basilio can choose to take 1, leaving 4, which is a losing position for Alice.Therefore, f(5,1)=true, which is correct.So, the pattern seems to be that every 3rd number is a losing position.Wait, n=1: winn=2: winn=3: winn=4: losen=5: winn=6: ?Let's compute f(6,1):f(6,1)= (6>=1 and not f(5,1)) or (6>=2 and not f(4,2))f(5,1)=true, so not f(5,1)=falsef(4,2)= (4>=2 and not f(2,2)) or (4>=3 and not f(1,3))f(2,2)=true, so not f(2,2)=falsef(1,3)= (1>=3? No) or (1>=4? No)= falseSo, not f(1,3)=trueTherefore, f(4,2)=false or true= trueSo, not f(4,2)=falseTherefore, f(6,1)=false or false= falseSo, f(6,1)=false, meaning it's a losing position.So, n=6, k=1: losing position.So, the losing positions seem to be n=4,7,10,... which are 1 mod 3? Wait, 4=3*1+1, 7=3*2+1, 10=3*3+1.Wait, 4,7,10,... are 1 mod 3.Wait, but n=1 is a winning position, which is 1 mod 3.Hmm, that contradicts.Wait, maybe the losing positions are n=4,7,10,... which are 1 mod 3, but n=1 is a winning position.Wait, maybe the losing positions are n=4,7,10,... which are 1 mod 3, but n=1 is a special case.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are n=4,8,12,... which are multiples of 4.But 4,8,12,... but n=6 was also a losing position.Wait, maybe it's better to see the losing positions as n=4,6,9,11,... Hmm, not sure.Wait, let's compute f(7,1):f(7,1)= (7>=1 and not f(6,1)) or (7>=2 and not f(5,2))f(6,1)=false, so not f(6,1)=truef(5,2)= (5>=2 and not f(3,2)) or (5>=3 and not f(2,3))f(3,2)=true, so not f(3,2)=falsef(2,3)= (2>=3? No) or (2>=4? No)= falseSo, not f(2,3)=trueTherefore, f(5,2)=false or true= trueSo, not f(5,2)=falseTherefore, f(7,1)=true or false= trueSo, f(7,1)=true, meaning it's a winning position.Wait, so n=7 is a winning position.Wait, so the losing positions so far are n=4 and n=6.Wait, let's compute f(8,1):f(8,1)= (8>=1 and not f(7,1)) or (8>=2 and not f(6,2))f(7,1)=true, so not f(7,1)=falsef(6,2)= (6>=2 and not f(4,2)) or (6>=3 and not f(3,3))f(4,2)=true, so not f(4,2)=falsef(3,3)= (3>=3 and not f(0,3)) or (3>=4? No)= not f(0,3)=trueSo, not f(3,3)=falseTherefore, f(6,2)=false or false= falseSo, not f(6,2)=trueTherefore, f(8,1)=false or true= trueSo, f(8,1)=true, meaning it's a winning position.Wait, so n=8 is a winning position.Wait, so the losing positions are n=4,6,9,11,...? Let's check n=9.f(9,1)= (9>=1 and not f(8,1)) or (9>=2 and not f(7,2))f(8,1)=true, so not f(8,1)=falsef(7,2)= (7>=2 and not f(5,2)) or (7>=3 and not f(4,3))f(5,2)=true, so not f(5,2)=falsef(4,3)= (4>=3 and not f(1,3)) or (4>=4 and not f(0,4))f(1,3)=false, so not f(1,3)=truef(0,4)=false, so not f(0,4)=trueTherefore, f(4,3)=true or true= trueSo, not f(4,3)=falseTherefore, f(7,2)=false or false= falseSo, not f(7,2)=trueTherefore, f(9,1)=false or true= trueSo, f(9,1)=true, meaning it's a winning position.Wait, so n=9 is a winning position.Wait, so far, the losing positions are n=4,6.Wait, let's compute f(10,1):f(10,1)= (10>=1 and not f(9,1)) or (10>=2 and not f(8,2))f(9,1)=true, so not f(9,1)=falsef(8,2)= (8>=2 and not f(6,2)) or (8>=3 and not f(5,3))f(6,2)=false, so not f(6,2)=truef(5,3)= (5>=3 and not f(2,3)) or (5>=4 and not f(1,4))f(2,3)=false, so not f(2,3)=truef(1,4)= (1>=4? No) or (1>=5? No)= falseSo, not f(1,4)=trueTherefore, f(5,3)=true or true= trueSo, not f(5,3)=falseTherefore, f(8,2)=true or false= trueSo, not f(8,2)=falseTherefore, f(10,1)=false or false= falseSo, f(10,1)=false, meaning it's a losing position.So, n=10 is a losing position.So, the losing positions are n=4,6,10,...Wait, 4,6,10,... which are 4,6,10,14,... which are 4 more than multiples of 3? 4=3+1, 6=6, 10=9+1, 14=12+2? Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, 4,6,10,14,... which are 4,6,10,14,... each time adding 2, then 4, then 4,... Not a clear pattern.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3, but n=4=3+1, n=7=6+1, but n=7 was a winning position.Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 4? 4=4, 6=4+2, 10=8+2, 14=12+2,... Hmm, 4,6,10,14,... which are 4,6,10,14,... each time adding 2, then 4, then 4,... Not sure.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of Grundy numbers.Wait, in Grundy theory, each position is assigned a Grundy number, which is the mex (minimum excludant) of the Grundy numbers of positions reachable in one move.But in this game, the moves are dependent on the previous move, so it's not a standard impartial game.Therefore, Grundy numbers may not apply here.Alternatively, maybe we can think of the game as a series of moves where the number of coins taken is non-decreasing by at most 1 each time.Therefore, the game is equivalent to a game where the number of coins taken is a sequence starting at 1, and each term is either equal to or one more than the previous.Therefore, the total number of coins is the sum of such a sequence.So, the game can be represented as a sequence of moves: 1, a2, a3, ..., where each ai = ai-1 or ai-1 +1.The total sum of this sequence is 1331.The player who cannot make a move loses.Therefore, the question is, can Alice force the sum to reach 1331 on Basilio's turn.Alternatively, maybe the key is to realize that the game is equivalent to a game where the number of coins is a triangular number.Wait, because the maximum number of coins that can be taken in n turns is n(n+1)/2.So, if the total number of coins is a triangular number, the second player can mirror the first player's moves to maintain the triangular number.But in our case, the starting number is 1331, which is not a triangular number.Wait, the closest triangular number below 1331 is 1326=51*52/2.So, 1331-1326=5.Therefore, if Alice can take 5 coins on her first move, she can leave Basilio with a triangular number, forcing him into a losing position.But she can't, because she has to take 1 coin first.Wait, maybe she can force the game into a state where Basilio is left with a triangular number.Alternatively, maybe the key is to realize that the game is equivalent to a game where the number of coins is a multiple of 3.Wait, but earlier analysis showed that losing positions are not necessarily multiples of 3.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of coins modulo 3.Wait, let's see:n=1: winn=2: winn=3: winn=4: losen=5: winn=6: losen=7: winn=8: winn=9: winn=10: losen=11: winn=12: loseWait, the losing positions are n=4,6,10,12,...Which are 4,6,10,12,... which are 4,6,10,12,... which are 4,6,10,12,... each time adding 2, then 4, then 2, then 4,... Not a clear pattern.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod 3, but n=4=1 mod 3, n=7=1 mod 3, but n=7 was a winning position.Wait, maybe not.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 0 mod 3, but n=6=0 mod 3, n=9=0 mod 3, but n=9 was a winning position.Wait, so that doesn't hold.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 2 mod 3, but n=5=2 mod 3, n=8=2 mod 3, but n=5 and n=8 were winning positions.Hmm, not helpful.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod 4.n=4=0 mod 4, n=6=2 mod 4, n=10=2 mod 4, n=12=0 mod 4.No, that doesn't fit.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 2 mod 4.n=6=2 mod 4, n=10=2 mod 4, n=14=2 mod 4.But n=4=0 mod 4 was a losing position.Hmm, not consistent.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod 2.n=4=0 mod 2, n=6=0 mod 2, n=10=0 mod 2, n=12=0 mod 2.No, that doesn't fit.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod something else.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are one less than a multiple of 3.n=4=3+1, n=6=6, n=10=9+1, n=12=12.Wait, 4=3+1, 10=9+1, but 6 and 12 are multiples of 3.Hmm, not consistent.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3 or multiples of 3.But n=4=3+1, n=6=6, n=10=9+1, n=12=12.So, 4,6,10,12,... which are 3+1, 6, 9+1, 12,...So,

numbers that are 0 mod 4 or 2 mod 4, but starting from n=4.But n=4,6,10,12,... which are 0,2,2,0 mod 4.Hmm, not sure.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 0 mod 4 or 2 mod 4, but only

numbers that are 1 mod 3 and even.But n=4,10,16,... which are 1 mod 3 and even.But n=16, let's check.Wait, computing f(16,1) would be tedious, but maybe we can see a pattern.Wait, n=4: losen=10: losen=16: ?Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod 3 and even.But let's check n=16.If n=16 is a losing position, then Basilio can force a win.But without computing, it's hard to say.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod 3 and even, starting from n=4.So, 4,10,16,22,...But 1331 divided by 3 is approximately 443.666, so 3*443=1329, so 1331=3*443 +

4.n=6=4+2, n=10=8+2, n=14=12+2,...Which are 6,10,14,...But n=6 and n=10 were losing positions, n=14 would be next.But 1331 mod 4= 1331/4=332*4=1328, so 1331=1328+3, so 1331 mod 4=3.So, 1331 is 3 mod 4.But n=14 is 2 mod 4, which is a losing position.Wait, not helpful.Wait, maybe the key is to realize that the losing positions are numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3, but only when the number is even.But n=4=3+1 and even, n=10=9+1 and even.But n=16=15+1 and even, which would be a losing position.But 1331 is odd, so it's not in that category.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3, regardless of parity.But n=7=6+1 was a winning position, so that can't be.Wait, I'm stuck.Alternatively, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3, but starting from n=4.But n=7 was a winning position, so that can't be.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 more than a multiple of 3, but only when the

when the number is even.So, n=4,10,16,...Which are 4,10,16,...Which are 4,10,16,...So, 4=3+1, 10=9+1, 16=15+1,...But 1331 is 3*443 + 2, so it's 2 mod 3.So, 1331 is not a losing position.Wait, but 1331 is the starting number, and Alice takes 1, leaving 1330.So, we need to see if 1330 is a losing position.Wait, 1330 mod 3=1330/3=443*3=1329, so 1330=1329+1, so 1330 mod 3=1.So, 1330 is 1 mod 3.From our earlier analysis, n=4,7,10,... which are 1 mod 3, are losing positions.Wait, n=4,7,10,13,... which are 1 mod 3.But earlier, n=7 was a winning position, so that contradicts.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod 3 and greater than or equal to 4.So, n=4,7,10,13,...But n=7 was a winning position, so that can't be.Wait, maybe the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod 3 and even.n=4=3+1 and even, n=10=9+1 and even, n=16=15+1 and even,...But n=7=6+1 and odd was a winning position.So, maybe 1330 is a losing position because it's 1 mod 3 and even.Wait, 1330=1329+1=3*443+1, so 1330 mod 3=1.And 1330 is even.So, if the losing positions are numbers that are 1 mod 3 and even, then 1330 is a losing position.Therefore, if Alice leaves Basilio with 1330, which is a losing position, then Basilio cannot win, so Alice can force a win.Wait, but in our earlier analysis, n=4, which is 1 mod 3 and even, was a losing position.Similarly, n=10, which is 1 mod 3 and even, was a losing position.So, if 1330 is a losing position, then Basilio cannot win, so Alice can ensure a win.Therefore, the answer is Alice can ensure a win.Wait, but let's confirm.If 1330 is a losing position, then Basilio cannot force a win, so Alice can.But how can we be sure that 1330 is a losing position?From our earlier analysis, n=4,10,16,... which are 1 mod 3 and even, were losing positions.So, 1330=3*443 +1, which is 1 mod 3, and even.Therefore, it's a losing position.Therefore, Basilio is in a losing position, so Alice can ensure a win.Therefore, the answer is Alice can ensure a win.**Final Answer**boxed{Alice}"},{"question":"Two skaters, Allie and Billie, are at points A and B, respectively, on a flat, frozen lake. The distance between A and B is 100 meters. Allie leaves A and skates at a speed of 8 meters per second on a straight line that makes a 60^circ angle with AB. At the same time Allie leaves A, Billie leaves B at a speed of 7 meters per second and follows the straight path that produces the earliest possible meeting of the two skaters, given their speeds. How many meters does Allie skate before meeting Billie?[asy] pointpen=black; pathpen=black+linewidth(0.7);  pair A=(0,0),B=(10,0),C=6*expi(pi/3); D(B--A); D(A--C,EndArrow); MP(\\"A\\",A,SW);MP(\\"B\\",B,SE);MP(\\"60^{circ}\\",A+(0.3,0),NE);MP(\\"100\\",(A+B)/2); [/asy]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about two skaters, Allie and Billie, starting from points A and B, respectively, on a frozen lake. The distance between A and B is 100 meters. Allie skates from A at 8 meters per second along a path that makes a 60-degree angle with AB. Billie skates from B at 7 meters per second towards a point where they can meet Allie as soon as possible. I need to find how many meters Allie skates before they meet.Hmm, let me visualize this. Points A and B are 100 meters apart. Allie starts at A, goes at 8 m/s, making a 60-degree angle with the line AB. Billie starts at B at the same time, going 7 m/s, and takes the path that will let them meet Allie earliest.I think I can model their paths as vectors. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let me place point A at (0, 0). Then point B would be at (100, 0), since the distance between A and B is 100 meters.Allie is moving at 8 m/s along a path making a 60-degree angle with AB. So, her velocity components would be:- Horizontal (x-direction): 8 * cos(60°)- Vertical (y-direction): 8 * sin(60°)Calculating those:cos(60°) is 0.5, so 8 * 0.5 = 4 m/s in the x-direction.sin(60°) is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866, so 8 * 0.866 ≈ 6.928 m/s in the y-direction.So Allie's position at time t seconds is (4t, 6.928t).Billie starts at (100, 0) and moves towards some point where they meet Allie. Let me denote Billie's velocity components as (vx, vy). Since Billie is moving towards the meeting point, her velocity vector should point directly towards Allie's position at time t. But since both are moving, this is a bit more complex.Wait, actually, Billie wants to minimize the time until they meet. So Billie's path is such that the time taken for both skaters to reach the meeting point is the same. So, let me denote the meeting time as t. Then, Allie skates 8t meters, and Billie skates 7t meters.But Billie is moving from (100, 0) to the meeting point, which is Allie's position at time t: (4t, 6.928t). So, the distance Billie needs to cover is the distance between (100, 0) and (4t, 6.928t). That distance should be equal to 7t meters.So, let me write the distance formula:√[(4t - 100)^2 + (6.928t - 0)^2] = 7tLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:(4t - 100)^2 + (6.928t)^2 = (7t)^2Expanding each term:First, (4t - 100)^2 = (4t)^2 - 2*4t*100 + 100^2 = 16t² - 800t + 10000Second, (6.928t)^2. Let me compute 6.928 squared. Since 6.928 is approximately √(48), because 6.928^2 ≈ 48. So, (6.928t)^2 ≈ 48t²Third, (7t)^2 = 49t²So putting it all together:16t² - 800t + 10000 + 48t² = 49t²Combine like terms:(16t² + 48t²) - 800t + 10000 = 49t²64t² - 800t + 10000 = 49t²Subtract 49t² from both sides:15t² - 800t + 10000 = 0So, we have a quadratic equation: 15t² - 800t + 10000 = 0Let me write it as:15t² - 800t + 10000 = 0I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 5:3t² - 160t + 2000 = 0Now, let's solve for t using the quadratic formula:t = [160 ± √(160² - 4*3*2000)] / (2*3)Compute discriminant D:D = 160² - 4*3*2000 = 25600 - 24000 = 1600√D = 40So,t = [160 ± 40] / 6So two solutions:t = (160 + 40)/6 = 200/6 ≈ 33.333 secondst = (160 - 40)/6 = 120/6 = 20 secondsSince we are looking for the earliest possible meeting time, we take the smaller t, which is 20 seconds.So, Allie skates for 20 seconds before meeting Billie.Therefore, the distance Allie skates is 8 m/s * 20 s = 160 meters.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 20 seconds seems a bit short given the initial distance is 100 meters.Wait, Allie is moving at 8 m/s, so in 20 seconds, she would have moved 160 meters. But the initial distance is 100 meters, so if they meet after 20 seconds, that would mean they have covered a combined distance of 160 + 140 = 300 meters, but the initial distance is only 100 meters. That seems contradictory.Wait, no, because they are moving towards each other but not directly. Allie is moving at a 60-degree angle, so their paths aren't directly towards each other.Wait, maybe my initial setup is correct, but let me check the quadratic equation again.So, I had:√[(4t - 100)^2 + (6.928t)^2] = 7tSquared both sides:(4t - 100)^2 + (6.928t)^2 = 49t²Which expanded to:16t² - 800t + 10000 + 48t² = 49t²So, 64t² - 800t + 10000 = 49t²Subtract 49t²:15t² - 800t + 10000 = 0Divide by 5:3t² - 160t + 2000 = 0Quadratic formula:t = [160 ± √(25600 - 24000)] / 6√1600 = 40t = (160 ± 40)/6So, t = 200/6 ≈ 33.333 or t = 120/6 = 20So, t = 20 is correct.But wait, if t = 20, then Allie skates 160 meters, and Billie skates 140 meters.But the initial distance between them is 100 meters, so how can they have skated a combined 300 meters? That seems like they are moving away from each other, but that's not the case.Wait, no, because Allie is moving at a 60-degree angle, so her displacement isn't directly towards or away from Billie. So, their paths are not colinear, so the distance between them isn't simply the difference or sum of their distances.Wait, perhaps my confusion arises because I'm thinking in terms of straight-line distance, but since Allie is moving at an angle, the relative motion is more complex.Wait, let me think about the positions.At time t, Allie is at (4t, 6.928t). Billie is moving from (100, 0) towards (4t, 6.928t), so her displacement is towards that point.So, the distance Billie needs to cover is the straight line between (100, 0) and (4t, 6.928t). So, that distance is sqrt[(4t - 100)^2 + (6.928t)^2], which is equal to 7t.So, that equation is correct.So, solving that gives t = 20 or t ≈ 33.333. Since 20 is smaller, that's the earliest meeting time.So, Allie skates 8 * 20 = 160 meters.Wait, but let me check if at t = 20, the positions make sense.Allie's position: (4*20, 6.928*20) = (80, 138.56)Billie's position: starting from (100, 0), moving towards (80, 138.56). The distance between (100, 0) and (80, 138.56) is sqrt[(100 - 80)^2 + (0 - 138.56)^2] = sqrt[400 + 19200] = sqrt[19600] = 140 meters. So, Billie skates 140 meters at 7 m/s, which takes 20 seconds. That checks out.So, Allie skates 160 meters in 20 seconds, and Billie skates 140 meters in 20 seconds. So, they meet at point (80, 138.56). That seems correct.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check t = 33.333.At t = 33.333, Allie is at (4*33.333, 6.928*33.333) ≈ (133.333, 230.933)Distance from B (100, 0) is sqrt[(133.333 - 100)^2 + (230.933)^2] ≈ sqrt[(33.333)^2 + (230.933)^2] ≈ sqrt[1111.11 + 53333.33] ≈ sqrt[54444.44] ≈ 233.333 meters.Billie skates at 7 m/s, so in 33.333 seconds, she would skate 233.333 meters, which is correct. So, both times are valid, but since we need the earliest meeting time, t = 20 is the answer.Therefore, Allie skates 160 meters.Wait, but let me think again about the relative motion. Is there another way to approach this problem, perhaps using relative velocity?Alternatively, I could model this as a pursuit curve problem, but since Billie is moving directly towards Allie's current position, which is changing, it's a bit more involved. However, in this case, since both start moving at the same time and meet at a point, the approach I took earlier is correct.So, I think 160 meters is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{160}"},{"question":"Sarah is planning to do some baking.

The average score of those admitted was 10 points higher than the admission score, and the average score of those not admitted was 26 points lower than the admission score. The average score of all the applicants was 70 points. What is the admission score?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a school's entrance exam. Let me try to parse it step by step. First, it says that only 1/4 of the applicants were admitted. Hmm, so if I let the total number of applicants be something, say N, then the number admitted would be N/4, and the number not admitted would be 3N/4. That seems straightforward.Next, it mentions the average score of those admitted was 10 points higher than the admission score. Wait, the admission score is the cutoff, right? So if someone scored above or equal to the admission score, they got in. So the average score of admitted students is 10 points higher than that cutoff. Let me denote the admission score as S. So the average score of admitted students is S + 10.Similarly, the average score of those not admitted was 26 points lower than the admission score. So that would be S - 26.Then, it says the average score of all the applicants was 70 points. So the overall average is 70. I need to find the admission score S.Let me structure this. Let's denote:- Total applicants: N- Admitted: N/4- Not admitted: 3N/4- Admission score: S- Average of admitted: S + 10- Average of not admitted: S - 26- Overall average: 70So, the total score of all applicants can be calculated in two ways: one is the overall average times the total number, which is 70N. The other is the sum of the total scores of admitted and not admitted.So, total score = (Admitted average * Number admitted) + (Not admitted average * Number not admitted)Which translates to:70N = (S + 10)*(N/4) + (S - 26)*(3N/4)Okay, so let me write that equation:70N = (S + 10)*(N/4) + (S - 26)*(3N/4)I can factor out N/4 from both terms on the right:70N = (N/4)[(S + 10) + 3(S - 26)]Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:(S + 10) + 3(S - 26) = S + 10 + 3S - 78 = 4S - 68So now, the equation becomes:70N = (N/4)(4S - 68)Simplify the right side:(N/4)(4S - 68) = N*(S - 17)So now, 70N = N*(S - 17)Since N is not zero, we can divide both sides by N:70 = S - 17Therefore, S = 70 + 17 = 87Wait, so the admission score is 87? Let me double-check my steps.1. Total applicants N, admitted N/4, not admitted 3N/4. Correct.2. Average of admitted: S + 10, average of not admitted: S - 26. Correct.3. Total score: 70N = (S + 10)(N/4) + (S - 26)(3N/4). Yes.4. Factoring N/4: 70N = (N/4)[(S + 10) + 3(S - 26)]. Correct.5. Inside the brackets: S + 10 + 3S - 78 = 4S - 68. Correct.6. So, 70N = (N/4)(4S - 68) = N*(S - 17). Correct.7. Dividing both sides by N: 70 = S - 17. So S = 87. Seems right.Wait, let me plug back into the original equation to verify.If S = 87, then:Average admitted: 87 + 10 = 97Average not admitted: 87 - 26 = 61Total score:Admitted: (N/4)*97Not admitted: (3N/4)*61Total: (97/4 + 183/4)N = (280/4)N = 70NWhich matches the overall average. So yes, that works.Therefore, the admission score is 87.**Final Answer**The admission score is boxed{87}."},{"question":"Six rectangles each with a common base width of 2 have lengths of 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36.

Then he unfolded the note, wrote something else on it, folded the note along the creases randomly (not necessarily as before), and left it on the table with a random side facing up. Find the probability that the inscription \\"MAME\\" is still on top.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem here about Vasya and his note. Let me try to visualize it step by step. First, Vasya writes a note on a piece of paper. Then he folds it into quarters. Hmm, folding into quarters usually means folding it twice, right? Like folding it in half one way and then folding it again the other way. So, if it's a square piece of paper, folding it into quarters would result in four smaller squares. But actually, the shape doesn't matter too much; what matters is the number of layers and how the folding affects the labeling.He labels the top with \\"MAME\\". So, after folding it into quarters, the top layer is labeled \\"MAME\\". Then he unfolds it. So, now the paper is flat again, but there are creases from the folding. Then he writes something else on it. Hmm, so now there are two writings: the original one with \\"MAME\\" on top when folded, and another one somewhere else on the paper.Next, he folds the note along the creases randomly, not necessarily as before. So, the folding could be in any direction, and then he leaves it on the table with a random side facing up. We need to find the probability that the inscription \\"MAME\\" is still on top.Okay, so let's break this down. When he folds the paper into quarters, there are four layers. The top layer is labeled \\"MAME\\". When he unfolds it, the creases are still there, so when he refolds it, the paper can be folded in different ways. Each fold can be in different directions, so the number of possible ways to fold it is important.But wait, how many different ways can he fold the paper into quarters? Since it's folded into quarters, each fold can be either mountain or valley, but since he's folding along the creases, maybe it's about the orientation. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of possible top layers after folding.Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the number of possible configurations when folding the paper. Since it's folded into quarters, there are four layers. Each fold can be in two directions, so maybe the number of possible ways is 2^2 = 4? Wait, no, because each fold is along a crease, and each crease can be folded in two directions.Wait, but actually, when folding into quarters, you have two folds: one horizontal and one vertical. Each can be folded in two directions, so the total number of folding configurations is 2 * 2 = 4. So, four possible ways to fold the paper.But then, after folding, he can also place it on the table with any side facing up. So, each folding configuration can result in different sides being on top. So, perhaps the total number of possible outcomes is the number of folding configurations multiplied by the number of sides that can be on top.Wait, but the paper is square, so it has four sides, but actually, when folded, the number of sides that can be on top depends on the folding. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the paper as having four quadrants, each of which can be on top after folding. Since the paper is folded into quarters, each fold brings a different quadrant to the top.Wait, but the original label \\"MAME\\" was on the top when folded. So, when he unfolds it, the label is on one of the four quadrants. Then, when he refolds it, depending on how he folds, the label could end up on top or not.So, perhaps the key is to figure out how many of the possible foldings result in the labeled quadrant being on top.But let me think again. When folding into quarters, each fold can be in two directions, so there are four possible folding configurations. Each configuration will bring a different quadrant to the top.Wait, so if he folds it in the same way as before, the \\"MAME\\" label will be on top. But if he folds it differently, another quadrant will be on top.But he can also flip the paper over, so the side that was originally the back could be on top. So, maybe each folding configuration can result in two different sides being on top.Wait, so perhaps the total number of possible outcomes is 4 foldings * 2 sides = 8.But the problem says he left it on the table with a random side facing up. So, maybe for each folding, there are two possible sides, but whether the label is on top depends on both the folding and the side.Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to model it more carefully.Let me consider the paper as a square with four quadrants: let's label them A, B, C, D. When folded into quarters, each fold can be mountain or valley, so each fold has two possibilities. So, for two folds, there are 2^2 = 4 possible folding configurations.Each folding configuration will result in one of the four quadrants being on top. So, if the label \\"MAME\\" is on quadrant A, then only one of the four folding configurations will result in A being on top.But then, after folding, he can place it on the table with a random side facing up. So, for each folding configuration, there are two possible sides: the original top or the original bottom.Wait, so if the folding configuration results in A being on top, then if he places it with the original top side up, \\"MAME\\" is visible. If he places it with the original bottom side up, \\"MAME\\" is on the bottom, so it's not visible.Similarly, if the folding configuration results in another quadrant on top, then regardless of which side he places it, \\"MAME\\" is either on the top or the bottom, but only if the folding configuration brings it to the top.Wait, no. If the folding configuration brings quadrant A to the top, then depending on which side he places it, \\"MAME\\" could be on the top or the bottom. But if the folding configuration brings another quadrant to the top, then \\"MAME\\" is either on the bottom or on the side, but not on the top.Wait, actually, no. Because when you fold the paper, the label is on a specific quadrant. So, if the folding configuration brings that quadrant to the top, then depending on which side is up, the label could be on the top or the bottom. But if the folding configuration brings another quadrant to the top, then the label is not on the top, regardless of which side is up.Wait, that might not be correct. Because when you fold the paper, the label is on a specific quadrant, but when you flip the paper, the label could end up on the opposite side.Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently. Let's consider the paper as having two sides: front and back. When folded, each quadrant can be on top, and each can be front or back.So, when Vasya first labels the top with \\"MAME\\", that is on the front side of the top quadrant. Then, when he unfolds it, the label is on one of the four quadrants on the front side.When he refolds it, he can choose any folding configuration, which will bring one of the four quadrants to the top. Then, he can place it on the table with either the front or the back side up.So, the probability that \\"MAME\\" is on top depends on two things: whether the folding configuration brings the labeled quadrant to the top, and whether the side he places it on is the front or the back.So, let's formalize this.There are four quadrants: A, B, C, D. \\"MAME\\" is on quadrant A on the front side.When refolding, there are four possible folding configurations, each bringing one of the four quadrants to the top. So, the probability that folding configuration brings A to the top is 1/4.Then, once the paper is folded such that A is on top, he can place it on the table with either the front or the back side up. So, there's a 1/2 chance that he places the front side up, making \\"MAME\\" visible, and a 1/2 chance he places the back side up, making \\"MAME\\" not visible.If the folding configuration does not bring A to the top, then regardless of which side he places it, \\"MAME\\" is not on top.Therefore, the total probability is the probability that the folding configuration brings A to the top multiplied by the probability that he places the front side up.So, that's (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.Wait, but that seems low. Let me check.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that when folding, each folding configuration can result in a different side being on top. So, perhaps the total number of possible outcomes is 4 (foldings) * 2 (sides) = 8.Out of these 8, only one outcome results in \\"MAME\\" being on top: the folding configuration that brings A to the top and placing it with the front side up.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.But wait, another thought: when folding, each fold can be in two directions, so for each fold, there are two choices. Since there are two folds, the total number of folding configurations is 2^2 = 4.Each folding configuration brings one of the four quadrants to the top. So, each quadrant has an equal chance of 1/4 to be on top.Then, for each folding configuration, he can place it on the table with either side up, so two possibilities. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 4 * 2 = 8.Out of these 8, only one outcome (folding A to top and placing front side up) results in \\"MAME\\" being on top.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.But wait, another perspective: when folding, each fold can be mountain or valley, so each fold has two possibilities. So, the number of folding configurations is 4.But when folding, the paper can be folded in such a way that the same quadrant is on top, but from different sides.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it as each folding configuration is equally likely, and for each configuration, the side is equally likely.So, the probability is 1/4 (for the correct folding) * 1/2 (for the correct side) = 1/8.Alternatively, maybe the folding configuration and the side are independent, so the total probability is 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8.But wait, another angle: when folding, the paper can be folded in such a way that the same quadrant is on top, but from the back. So, maybe for each quadrant, there are two possible ways to bring it to the top: front or back.So, the total number of folding configurations is 4 quadrants * 2 sides = 8.Out of these 8, only one configuration brings the labeled quadrant to the top with the front side up.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.Wait, but actually, when folding, the side is determined by the folding direction. So, maybe the folding configuration inherently determines the side.Wait, no, because after folding, he can flip the paper over, so the side is independent of the folding configuration.Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 4 foldings * 2 sides = 8.Only one of these 8 outcomes results in \\"MAME\\" being on top.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.But wait, another thought: when folding, the paper can be folded in such a way that the same quadrant is on top, but from the back. So, maybe for each quadrant, there are two possible ways to bring it to the top: front or back.So, the total number of folding configurations is 4 quadrants * 2 sides = 8.Out of these 8, only one configuration brings the labeled quadrant to the top with the front side up.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.But wait, I'm not sure if the folding configuration inherently determines the side. Maybe when you fold the paper, the side is fixed, and flipping it over is a separate action.So, perhaps the total number of possible outcomes is 4 foldings * 2 sides = 8.Out of these 8, only one outcome (folding A to top and placing front side up) results in \\"MAME\\" being on top.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.But wait, another perspective: when folding, the paper can be folded in such a way that the same quadrant is on top, but from the back. So, maybe for each quadrant, there are two possible ways to bring it to the top: front or back.So, the total number of folding configurations is 4 quadrants * 2 sides = 8.Out of these 8, only one configuration brings the labeled quadrant to the top with the front side up.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.But wait, actually, when you fold the paper, the side is determined by the folding. So, maybe the folding configuration inherently determines the side.Wait, no, because after folding, he can flip the paper over, so the side is independent of the folding configuration.Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 4 foldings * 2 sides = 8.Only one of these 8 outcomes results in \\"MAME\\" being on top.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.But wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because when folding, the side is determined by the folding direction. So, for example, if you fold the paper in a certain way, the top layer could be the front or the back, depending on the fold.Wait, maybe it's better to think that each folding configuration can result in two possible sides being on top: front or back. So, for each of the 4 folding configurations, there are 2 possible sides, making 8 total possibilities.Out of these 8, only one possibility is the correct folding configuration with the correct side up.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.But I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it another way.Suppose the paper is divided into four quadrants: A, B, C, D. \\"MAME\\" is on quadrant A on the front side.When folding, each fold can be mountain or valley, so for two folds, there are 4 possible configurations.Each configuration will bring one quadrant to the top. So, each quadrant has an equal chance of 1/4 to be on top.Now, once a quadrant is on top, he can place the paper on the table with either the front or the back side up. So, for each quadrant, there's a 1/2 chance of placing the front side up.Therefore, the probability that quadrant A is on top and the front side is up is (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.Yes, that makes sense.Alternatively, if we consider all possible outcomes, there are 4 foldings * 2 sides = 8. Only one of these outcomes is the desired one.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.Wait, but another thought: when folding, the side is determined by the folding direction. So, maybe the folding configuration inherently determines the side. For example, if you fold the paper in a certain way, the top layer could be the front or the back.So, maybe the total number of folding configurations is 4, each bringing a different quadrant to the top, but each can be front or back. So, 4 * 2 = 8 configurations.Out of these 8, only one configuration brings quadrant A to the top with the front side up.Therefore, the probability is 1/8.Yes, that seems consistent.So, after considering all these angles, I think the probability is 1/8.**Final Answer**The probability that the inscription \\"MAME\\" is still on top is boxed{dfrac{1}{8}}."},{"question":"Given that {a_n} is a geometric sequence with positive terms, where S_5=3, S_{15}=21, find S_{20} = ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a geometric sequence. Let me read it again: {a_n} is a geometric sequence with positive terms, where S_5 = 3 and S_{15} = 21. I need to find S_{20}. Hmm, okay. First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, the nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as a_n = a_1 * r^{n-1}, where a_1 is the first term.Now, the problem mentions S_5 and S_{15}, which are the sums of the first 5 and 15 terms, respectively. I remember that the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by the formula S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n)/(1 - r) when r ≠ 1. Since the terms are positive, r must be positive as well, and since it's a geometric sequence, r can't be 1 because that would make all terms equal, and the sums would just be multiples of a_1, which probably wouldn't give the specific sums given here.So, given that, I can write the equations for S_5 and S_{15}:S_5 = a_1 * (1 - r^5)/(1 - r) = 3S_{15} = a_1 * (1 - r^{15})/(1 - r) = 21Hmm, okay. So, I have two equations here with two unknowns: a_1 and r. Maybe I can divide the second equation by the first to eliminate a_1. Let me try that.Dividing S_{15} by S_5:(S_{15}) / (S_5) = [a_1 * (1 - r^{15})/(1 - r)] / [a_1 * (1 - r^5)/(1 - r)] = (1 - r^{15}) / (1 - r^5) = 21 / 3 = 7So, (1 - r^{15}) / (1 - r^5) = 7Hmm, that simplifies to 1 - r^{15} = 7*(1 - r^5)Let me write that out:1 - r^{15} = 7 - 7r^5Bring all terms to one side:1 - r^{15} - 7 + 7r^5 = 0Simplify:-6 + 7r^5 - r^{15} = 0Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me see.Notice that r^{15} is (r^5)^3, so maybe I can let x = r^5, which would make the equation:-6 + 7x - x^3 = 0Which is the same as:x^3 - 7x + 6 = 0Okay, so now I have a cubic equation in terms of x: x^3 - 7x + 6 = 0I need to solve this for x. Let me try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 6 divided by factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.Let me test x=1:1 - 7 + 6 = 0. Yes, 0. So, x=1 is a root. Therefore, (x - 1) is a factor.Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out. Let's do synthetic division:Coefficients: 1 (x^3), 0 (x^2), -7 (x), 6 (constant)Divide by x - 1:1 | 1  0  -7  6Bring down 1.Multiply by 1: 1Add to next term: 0 + 1 = 1Multiply by 1: 1Add to next term: -7 + 1 = -6Multiply by 1: -6Add to last term: 6 + (-6) = 0So, the cubic factors as (x - 1)(x^2 + x - 6)Now, factor x^2 + x - 6:Looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to 1. That would be 3 and -2.So, x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2)Therefore, the cubic factors as (x - 1)(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0So, the roots are x = 1, x = -3, x = 2.But remember, x = r^5, and since the terms of the geometric sequence are positive, r must be positive, so x must be positive as well. Therefore, x cannot be -3. So, possible solutions are x = 1 and x = 2.But let's check x = 1: If x = 1, then r^5 = 1, so r = 1. But earlier, I noted that r can't be 1 because then the sum would be n*a_1, which would make S_5 = 5a_1 = 3, so a_1 = 3/5, and S_{15} = 15a_1 = 9, but in the problem, S_{15} is 21, not 9. So, x=1 is not a valid solution here.Therefore, the only valid solution is x = 2. So, r^5 = 2, which means r = 2^{1/5}. Since r is positive, that's fine.Okay, so r = 2^{1/5}. Now, let's find a_1.From S_5 = a_1*(1 - r^5)/(1 - r) = 3We know r^5 = 2, so plug that in:S_5 = a_1*(1 - 2)/(1 - r) = a_1*(-1)/(1 - r) = 3So, a_1*(-1)/(1 - r) = 3Multiply both sides by (1 - r):a_1*(-1) = 3*(1 - r)So, -a_1 = 3 - 3rMultiply both sides by -1:a_1 = -3 + 3rSo, a_1 = 3(r - 1)But since r = 2^{1/5}, let's write that:a_1 = 3(2^{1/5} - 1)Okay, so now we have a_1 and r. Now, the problem asks for S_{20}.So, S_{20} = a_1*(1 - r^{20})/(1 - r)We can plug in a_1 and r.But let's see if we can express this in terms of S_5 and S_{15} or something to make it easier.Alternatively, since we know r^5 = 2, maybe we can express r^{20} as (r^5)^4 = 2^4 = 16.So, r^{20} = 16.Therefore, S_{20} = a_1*(1 - 16)/(1 - r) = a_1*(-15)/(1 - r)But from earlier, we have a_1 = 3(r - 1). Let's plug that in:S_{20} = 3(r - 1)*(-15)/(1 - r)Simplify the denominator: 1 - r = -(r - 1), so:S_{20} = 3(r - 1)*(-15)/(-(r - 1)) = 3*(-15)/(-1) = 3*15 = 45Wait, let me double-check that step.We have:S_{20} = a_1*(1 - r^{20})/(1 - r) = [3(r - 1)]*(1 - 16)/(1 - r) = 3(r - 1)*(-15)/(1 - r)Notice that (r - 1) is -(1 - r), so:= 3*(-1)*(1 - r)*(-15)/(1 - r)The (1 - r) terms cancel out:= 3*(-1)*(-15) = 3*15 = 45Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since S_{15} = 21, and S_{20} is the sum up to 20 terms, which is 5 more terms after 15. So, maybe we can express S_{20} as S_{15} + r^{15}*S_5.Wait, let me think about that.In a geometric sequence, the sum of terms from n+1 to m is equal to r^n * S_{m - n}. So, in this case, the sum from 16 to 20 is r^{15} * S_5.Therefore, S_{20} = S_{15} + r^{15} * S_5We know S_{15} = 21, S_5 = 3, and r^{15} = (r^5)^3 = 2^3 = 8So, S_{20} = 21 + 8*3 = 21 + 24 = 45Yes, that's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms that S_{20} is 45.Therefore, the answer is 45.**Final Answer**The sum of the first 20 terms is boxed{45}."},{"question":"How to refute the statement: \\"If a number is divisible by 5, then it ends with the digit 5\\"?","answer":"First, I need to understand the original statement: \\"If a number is divisible by 5, then it ends with the digit 5.\\" This is a conditional statement where divisibility by 5 implies the number ends in 5.To refute this, I should find a counterexample—a number that is divisible by 5 but does not end with 5. The most straightforward example is 10, which is divisible by 5 (since 10 ÷ 5 = 2) but ends with 0 instead of 5.This counterexample shows that the original statement is not universally true because there are numbers divisible by 5 that do not end with 5.

If there were 400 nails in the container, how many nails are remaining?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many nails the fixer used for the kitchen. Since there are 400 nails in total and 30% were used for the kitchen, I calculate 30% of 400, which is 120 nails.Next, I'll find out how many nails are left after repairing the kitchen. Subtracting the 120 nails used from the total, there are 280 nails remaining.Then, the fixer uses 70% of the remaining nails for the fence. Calculating 70% of 280 gives 196 nails used for the fence.Finally, to find out how many nails are left after both repairs, I subtract the 196 nails used for the fence from the remaining 280 nails.

What is the area of ( triangle BEC )?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about triangle ABC with an area of 36. Points D and E are defined in a certain way, and I need to find the area of triangle BEC. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, triangle ABC. Let me sketch it out in my mind. Point A, B, and C. The area is 36, so that's a good starting point. Now, point D is on AB such that BD = 2AD. So, that means D divides AB into two parts, AD and BD, with BD being twice as long as AD. So, if I let AD be x, then BD would be 2x, making the entire length of AB equal to 3x. So, D is closer to A than to B.Next, point E is on DC such that DE = 2EC. So, similar idea here. E divides DC into DE and EC, with DE being twice as long as EC. So, if EC is y, then DE is 2y, making DC equal to 3y. So, E is closer to D than to C.I need to find the area of triangle BEC. Hmm, okay. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry for this? Or perhaps mass point geometry? Or maybe area ratios?Let me try coordinate geometry because I can assign coordinates to the points and calculate the areas more directly.Let me place point A at (0, 0) for simplicity. Let me assume AB is along the x-axis, so point B would be at (3, 0) since AB is 3x, but I don't know the actual length. Wait, maybe I can just assign coordinates without worrying about the actual lengths.Alternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates such that point A is at (0, 0), point B is at (3, 0), and point C is somewhere in the plane, say (c, h). Then, the area of triangle ABC is 36, so using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates, it's (base * height)/2. The base AB is 3 units (from (0,0) to (3,0)), so the height would be h, so (3 * h)/2 = 36. Therefore, h = 24. So, point C is at (c, 24). Hmm, but I don't know c. Wait, but maybe it doesn't matter because the area ratios might not depend on c? Let me think.Alternatively, maybe I can set point C at (0, 24), making ABC a right triangle. But then AB would be along the x-axis from (0,0) to (3,0), and C at (0,24). Then, the area would indeed be (3*24)/2 = 36. That works. So, let me fix the coordinates as follows:- A: (0, 0)- B: (3, 0)- C: (0, 24)So, triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 24. That should make calculations easier.Now, point D is on AB such that BD = 2AD. Since AB is from (0,0) to (3,0), the length is 3. So, AD is 1, and BD is 2. Therefore, point D is at (1, 0).Now, point E is on DC such that DE = 2EC. So, DC is from D(1,0) to C(0,24). Let me find the coordinates of E.Since DE = 2EC, the ratio DE:EC is 2:1. So, E divides DC in the ratio 2:1. So, using the section formula, the coordinates of E can be found.The section formula says that if a point divides a line segment joining (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in the ratio m:n, then the coordinates are ((mx2 + nx1)/(m + n), (my2 + ny1)/(m + n)).Here, D is (1,0) and C is (0,24). The ratio is DE:EC = 2:1, so m = 2, n = 1.Therefore, E's coordinates are ((2*0 + 1*1)/(2+1), (2*24 + 1*0)/(2+1)) = (1/3, 48/3) = (1/3, 16).So, E is at (1/3, 16).Now, I need to find the area of triangle BEC. Points B, E, and C.Point B is at (3,0), E is at (1/3,16), and C is at (0,24).To find the area of triangle BEC, I can use the shoelace formula.The shoelace formula for three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is:Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|Plugging in the coordinates:x1 = 3, y1 = 0x2 = 1/3, y2 = 16x3 = 0, y3 = 24So,Area = |(3*(16 - 24) + (1/3)*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - 16))/2|Calculate each term:First term: 3*(16 - 24) = 3*(-8) = -24Second term: (1/3)*(24 - 0) = (1/3)*24 = 8Third term: 0*(0 - 16) = 0Adding them up: -24 + 8 + 0 = -16Take absolute value: | -16 | = 16Divide by 2: 16/2 = 8So, the area is 8.Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my calculations.Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors or base-height.But let me try another method just to confirm.Another way is to find the area using coordinates.The area can also be calculated by finding the determinant:Area = (1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |Which is essentially the same as the shoelace formula.So, plugging in again:(1/2)| 3*(16 - 24) + (1/3)*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - 16) |= (1/2)| 3*(-8) + (1/3)*24 + 0 |= (1/2)| -24 + 8 + 0 |= (1/2)| -16 | = (1/2)*16 = 8Same result. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors.Let me denote vectors for points B, E, C.But maybe that's overcomplicating.Alternatively, I can use the concept of areas in triangles with ratios.Since D divides AB in a 1:2 ratio, and E divides DC in a 2:1 ratio.So, maybe I can find the area step by step.First, the area of triangle ABC is 36.Point D divides AB into AD:DB = 1:2.So, the area of triangle ADC would be (1/3) of ABC, since AD is 1/3 of AB.Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Because the area depends on the base and height.Since D is on AB, which is the base, and the height from C remains the same.So, area of ADC is (AD/AB)*area of ABC = (1/3)*36 = 12.Similarly, area of DBC is (2/3)*36 = 24.Now, point E is on DC such that DE:EC = 2:1.So, E divides DC into 2:1.Therefore, the area of triangle DEC would be (1/3) of area of DBC.Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. Because E is on DC, so the area ratio would be based on the ratio of DE to DC.Wait, so area of triangle DEC is (EC/DC)*area of DBC.But EC is 1/3 of DC, so area of DEC is (1/3)*24 = 8.Similarly, area of triangle BEC would be?Wait, no. Wait, triangle BEC is not DEC. Let me think.Wait, triangle BEC is formed by points B, E, and C.So, perhaps I can express the area of BEC in terms of other areas.Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles or area ratios.Alternatively, since E is on DC, maybe I can express BEC as a portion of DBC.Wait, let me think.In triangle DBC, point E is on DC such that DE:EC = 2:1.So, E divides DC into 2:1.Therefore, the area of triangle BEC would be (EC/DC)*area of DBC.But EC is 1/3 of DC, so area of BEC is (1/3)*24 = 8.Wait, that's the same answer as before.So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way: using mass point geometry.But maybe that's more complicated.Alternatively, using coordinate geometry as I did earlier, which gave me 8.So, seems like 8 is the answer.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think again.So, area of ABC is 36.Point D divides AB into 1:2, so area of ADC is 12, DBC is 24.Point E divides DC into 2:1, so area of DEC is 8, and area of BEC is 8.Wait, but why is area of BEC equal to area of DEC?Wait, no, actually, in triangle DBC, E is a point on DC such that DE:EC = 2:1.So, the area of triangle BEC is proportional to EC.So, since EC is 1/3 of DC, the area of BEC is 1/3 of the area of DBC.Which is 1/3 *24=8.Yes, that makes sense.Alternatively, if I think about the coordinates, point E is closer to D, so the area of BEC is smaller than DBC.But 8 is 1/3 of 24, so that seems correct.Alternatively, another way: using vectors.Let me assign vectors to the points.Let me take A as the origin.So, vector A = (0,0)Vector B = (3,0)Vector C = (0,24)Then, vector D is on AB such that BD = 2AD.So, since AB is from (0,0) to (3,0), D is at (1,0).So, vector D = (1,0)Then, vector E is on DC such that DE = 2EC.So, vector DC is C - D = (0,24) - (1,0) = (-1,24)So, vector DC is (-1,24). Now, E divides DC into DE:EC = 2:1.So, vector DE = (2/3)*vector DC = (2/3)*(-1,24) = (-2/3, 16)Therefore, vector E = D + DE = (1,0) + (-2/3,16) = (1 - 2/3, 0 +16) = (1/3,16)So, E is at (1/3,16), same as before.Now, to find the area of triangle BEC.Vectors for points B, E, C.Vector B = (3,0)Vector E = (1/3,16)Vector C = (0,24)The area can be found using the cross product formula:Area = (1/2)| (B × E + E × C + C × B) |But wait, actually, in 2D, the area is (1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |, which is the shoelace formula again.So, plugging in:x1 = 3, y1 = 0x2 = 1/3, y2 =16x3 =0, y3=24Area = (1/2)| 3*(16 -24) + (1/3)*(24 -0) +0*(0 -16) |= (1/2)| 3*(-8) + (1/3)*24 +0 |= (1/2)| -24 +8 +0 | = (1/2)| -16 | = 8Same result.So, seems like 8 is the correct answer.Alternatively, maybe I can use parametric equations or something else, but I think I've verified it enough.So, I think the area of triangle BEC is 8.**Final Answer**The area of ( triangle BEC ) is boxed{8}."},{"question":"For any natural number, let  S(n)  denote sum of digits of  n . Find the number of  3  digit numbers for which  S(S(n)) = 2 .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of three-digit numbers n such that S(S(n)) equals 2. Here, S(n) is the sum of the digits of n. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's understand what the problem is asking. We have a three-digit number, which means n is between 100 and 999 inclusive. For each such number, we calculate the sum of its digits, which is S(n). Then, we take that sum and calculate the sum of its digits again, which is S(S(n)). We need to find how many such numbers n satisfy the condition that S(S(n)) equals 2.Alright, so let's start by understanding what S(S(n)) = 2 implies. Since S(S(n)) is the sum of the digits of S(n), and the result is 2, S(n) must be a number whose digits add up to 2. What numbers have digits that add up to 2? Well, they could be single-digit numbers like 2, or two-digit numbers like 11, 20, 101, 110, etc. But wait, actually, S(n) is the sum of the digits of n, which is a three-digit number. So, what's the possible range of S(n)?For a three-digit number, the smallest possible sum of digits is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1, and the largest is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27. So, S(n) can be any integer from 1 to 27. Therefore, S(S(n)) is the sum of the digits of a number between 1 and 27. Let's list all the numbers between 1 and 27 whose digits add up to 2.Starting from the smallest:- 2: digits sum to 2.- 11: 1 + 1 = 2.- 20: 2 + 0 = 2.- 101: Wait, but 101 is greater than 27, so we don't need to consider that. Similarly, 110 is also beyond 27. So, within 1 to 27, the numbers whose digits add up to 2 are 2, 11, and 20.Therefore, S(n) must be either 2, 11, or 20. So, our problem reduces to finding the number of three-digit numbers n such that S(n) is 2, 11, or 20.So, now, we can break this down into three separate problems:1. Find the number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 2.2. Find the number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 11.3. Find the number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 20.Then, we can add up these three quantities to get the total number of three-digit numbers n where S(S(n)) = 2.Let me handle each case one by one.**Case 1: S(n) = 2**We need to find the number of three-digit numbers where the sum of the digits is 2. Let's denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit. Since it's a three-digit number, A can be from 1 to 9, and B and C can be from 0 to 9.We need A + B + C = 2.But since A is at least 1, the minimum sum is 1 (if A=1, B=0, C=0). So, the equation A + B + C = 2 with A ≥ 1, B ≥ 0, C ≥ 0.Let me make a substitution to handle the constraint A ≥ 1. Let A' = A - 1, so A' ≥ 0. Then, the equation becomes:(A' + 1) + B + C = 2 => A' + B + C = 1.Now, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to A' + B + C = 1, where A', B, C are non-negative integers.This is a classic stars and bars problem. The number of solutions is C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3.But wait, let me think again. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xk = n is C(n + k - 1, k - 1). So here, n = 1, k = 3. So, it's C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3.So, there are 3 solutions. Let's list them:1. A' = 1, B = 0, C = 0 => A = 2, B = 0, C = 0 => number 2002. A' = 0, B = 1, C = 0 => A = 1, B = 1, C = 0 => number 1103. A' = 0, B = 0, C = 1 => A = 1, B = 0, C = 1 => number 101So, indeed, there are 3 three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 2.**Case 2: S(n) = 11**Now, we need to find the number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 11. Again, let's denote the number as ABC, with A ≥ 1, B and C ≥ 0, and A + B + C = 11.This is a more involved case. Let's use the stars and bars method again, but we have to consider the constraints that A is at least 1 and at most 9, and B and C are at least 0 and at most 9.First, let's adjust for A ≥ 1 by letting A' = A - 1, so A' ≥ 0. Then, the equation becomes:(A' + 1) + B + C = 11 => A' + B + C = 10.Now, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to A' + B + C = 10, with A' ≤ 8 (since A = A' + 1 ≤ 9 => A' ≤ 8), B ≤ 9, and C ≤ 9.Without any constraints, the number of solutions is C(10 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(12, 2) = 66.But now, we need to subtract the cases where A' > 8, B > 9, or C > 9.Let's compute the number of solutions where A' ≥ 9. Let A'' = A' - 9, so A'' ≥ 0. Then, the equation becomes A'' + B + C = 10 - 9 = 1. The number of solutions is C(1 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(3, 2) = 3.Similarly, the number of solutions where B ≥ 10. Let B' = B - 10, so B' ≥ 0. Then, the equation becomes A' + B' + C = 10 - 10 = 0. The number of solutions is C(0 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(2, 2) = 1.Similarly, the number of solutions where C ≥ 10 is also 1.Now, we need to check if there are any overlaps where two variables exceed their limits simultaneously. For example, A' ≥ 9 and B ≥ 10. Let's see:If A' ≥ 9 and B ≥ 10, then A'' = A' - 9, B' = B - 10. Then, the equation becomes A'' + B' + C = 10 - 9 - 10 = -9. Since the sum is negative, there are no solutions in this case. Similarly, any overlap of two constraints will result in a negative sum, which is impossible. Therefore, there are no overlapping cases to consider.Similarly, for A' ≥ 9 and C ≥ 10, same thing: A'' + B + C' = 10 - 9 - 10 = -9, which is impossible.Same for B ≥ 10 and C ≥ 10: A' + B' + C' = 10 - 10 - 10 = -10, which is impossible.Therefore, the total number of invalid solutions is 3 (for A' ≥ 9) + 1 (for B ≥ 10) + 1 (for C ≥ 10) = 5.Therefore, the number of valid solutions is 66 - 5 = 61.Wait, hold on, let me verify that.Wait, no, actually, when we subtract the invalid cases, we have to subtract each invalid case, but since there are no overlaps, it's just 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. So, 66 - 5 = 61.But wait, let me think again. Because when we subtract the cases where A' ≥ 9, B ≥ 10, and C ≥ 10, we have to make sure we're not overcounting. But since in this case, the overlaps are impossible, as we saw, so 5 is correct.Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum 11 is 61.Wait, but let me test this with a different approach to make sure.Alternatively, we can model this as the number of non-negative integer solutions to A' + B + C = 10, with A' ≤ 8, B ≤ 9, C ≤ 9.We can use inclusion-exclusion.Total solutions without constraints: C(12, 2) = 66.Subtract solutions where A' ≥ 9: 3.Subtract solutions where B ≥ 10: 1.Subtract solutions where C ≥ 10: 1.Total subtracted: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.No overlaps, so total valid solutions: 66 - 5 = 61.Yes, that seems correct.So, 61 three-digit numbers have digit sum 11.**Case 3: S(n) = 20**Now, we need to find the number of three-digit numbers where the sum of digits is 20. Again, let's denote the number as ABC, with A ≥ 1, B and C ≥ 0, and A + B + C = 20.This is another case where we can use stars and bars with constraints.First, let's adjust for A ≥ 1 by letting A' = A - 1, so A' ≥ 0. Then, the equation becomes:(A' + 1) + B + C = 20 => A' + B + C = 19.Now, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to A' + B + C = 19, with A' ≤ 8 (since A = A' + 1 ≤ 9 => A' ≤ 8), B ≤ 9, and C ≤ 9.Without any constraints, the number of solutions is C(19 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(21, 2) = 210.But now, we need to subtract the cases where A' > 8, B > 9, or C > 9.Let's compute the number of solutions where A' ≥ 9. Let A'' = A' - 9, so A'' ≥ 0. Then, the equation becomes A'' + B + C = 19 - 9 = 10. The number of solutions is C(10 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(12, 2) = 66.Similarly, the number of solutions where B ≥ 10. Let B' = B - 10, so B' ≥ 0. Then, the equation becomes A' + B' + C = 19 - 10 = 9. The number of solutions is C(9 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(11, 2) = 55.Similarly, the number of solutions where C ≥ 10 is also 55.Now, we need to consider overlaps where two variables exceed their limits simultaneously.First, the number of solutions where A' ≥ 9 and B ≥ 10.Let A'' = A' - 9, B' = B - 10. Then, the equation becomes A'' + B' + C = 19 - 9 - 10 = 0. The number of solutions is C(0 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(2, 2) = 1.Similarly, the number of solutions where A' ≥ 9 and C ≥ 10 is also 1.Next, the number of solutions where B ≥ 10 and C ≥ 10.Let B' = B - 10, C' = C - 10. Then, the equation becomes A' + B' + C' = 19 - 10 - 10 = -1. Since the sum is negative, there are no solutions here.Similarly, the number of solutions where A' ≥ 9, B ≥ 10, and C ≥ 10 would be even more negative, so no solutions.Therefore, the total number of overlapping cases is 1 (A' ≥9 and B ≥10) + 1 (A' ≥9 and C ≥10) + 0 (B ≥10 and C ≥10) = 2.Now, applying inclusion-exclusion, the total number of invalid solutions is:(Number of A' ≥9) + (Number of B ≥10) + (Number of C ≥10) - (Number of overlaps)Which is 66 + 55 + 55 - 2 = 174.Wait, hold on, that can't be right because 66 + 55 + 55 = 176, minus 2 overlaps is 174. But the total number of solutions without constraints was 210, so 210 - 174 = 36. Hmm, but let me think.Wait, no, actually, inclusion-exclusion formula is:Total invalid = (A' ≥9) + (B ≥10) + (C ≥10) - (A' ≥9 and B ≥10) - (A' ≥9 and C ≥10) - (B ≥10 and C ≥10) + (A' ≥9 and B ≥10 and C ≥10)But in our case, (B ≥10 and C ≥10) is 0, and (A' ≥9 and B ≥10 and C ≥10) is also 0. So, the formula becomes:Total invalid = 66 + 55 + 55 - 1 - 1 - 0 + 0 = 66 + 55 + 55 - 2 = 174.Therefore, the number of valid solutions is 210 - 174 = 36.Wait, but let me verify this because 36 seems a bit low.Alternatively, let's think about how many three-digit numbers have digits summing to 20.Since the maximum digit sum is 27, 20 is relatively high, so there shouldn't be too many numbers. 36 seems plausible.But let me try a different approach to verify.Another way is to consider that A + B + C = 20, with A ≥1, A ≤9, B ≤9, C ≤9.We can model this as the number of integer solutions where 1 ≤ A ≤9, 0 ≤ B ≤9, 0 ≤ C ≤9, and A + B + C = 20.Alternatively, we can think of it as the number of solutions to A' + B + C = 19, with A' = A -1, so 0 ≤ A' ≤8, 0 ≤ B ≤9, 0 ≤ C ≤9.So, the number of solutions is equal to the coefficient of x^19 in the generating function:(1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^8)(1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^9)^2.But computing that might be tedious. Alternatively, we can use stars and bars with inclusion-exclusion as above.Wait, but according to our previous calculation, it's 36. Let me see if that makes sense.Wait, another way to compute is to note that for A' + B + C =19, with A' ≤8, B ≤9, C ≤9.So, the maximum possible value for A' is 8, so the remaining 19 - 8 =11 must be distributed between B and C, each of which can be at most 9.So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of solutions where A' =8, and B + C =11, with B ≤9, C ≤9.Similarly, for A' =7, B + C =12, but since B and C can be at most 9, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to B + C =12 with B ≤9, C ≤9. Which is 12 - 9 = 3, so 12 - 9 +1 =4? Wait, no.Wait, the number of solutions to B + C =12 with B ≤9, C ≤9 is equal to the number of solutions without constraints minus the solutions where B >9 or C >9.Number of solutions without constraints: C(12 + 2 -1, 2 -1) = C(13,1)=13.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B' = B -10, so B' ≥0. Then, B' + C =12 -10=2. Number of solutions: C(2 +2 -1, 2 -1)=C(3,1)=3.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9 is also 3.But we have to subtract the overlap where both B >9 and C >9, which would be B' + C' =12 -10 -10= -8, which is impossible. So, total invalid solutions: 3 +3=6.Therefore, number of valid solutions:13 -6=7.Similarly, for A'=7, B + C=12, number of solutions is7.Wait, but hold on, when A'=7, B + C=12, which is the same as above, so 7 solutions.Similarly, for A'=6, B + C=13.Number of solutions without constraints: C(13 +2 -1,2 -1)=C(14,1)=14.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B'=B-10, so B' + C=13 -10=3. Number of solutions: C(3 +2 -1,2 -1)=C(4,1)=4.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9 is also4.Number of solutions where both B >9 and C >9: B' + C' =13 -10 -10= -7, which is impossible.Therefore, total invalid solutions:4 +4=8.Number of valid solutions:14 -8=6.Similarly, for A'=6, B + C=13, number of solutions is6.Wait, but hold on, when A' decreases, the required sum for B + C increases, but the number of solutions may not necessarily decrease. Wait, in this case, when A' decreases from 8 to 7, the required sum increases from11 to12, but the number of solutions decreased from... Wait, when A'=8, B + C=11, which had 11 - 9=2, so number of solutions was 11 - 9 +1=3? Wait, no, earlier we had a different method.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute for each A' from 0 to8, the number of solutions where B + C=19 - A', with B ≤9, C ≤9.So, for each A' from0 to8, compute the number of solutions to B + C=19 - A', with B ≤9, C ≤9.Let me tabulate this:- A'=0: B + C=19. Since B and C can be at most9, the maximum B + C=18. So, no solutions.- A'=1: B + C=18. Similarly, maximum is18, so only one solution: B=9, C=9.- A'=2: B + C=17. Number of solutions where B ≤9, C ≤9. The number of solutions is 17 -9=8, so 8 +1=9? Wait, no. Wait, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer solutions to B + C=17, with B ≤9, C ≤9.So, without constraints, it's18. But we have to subtract the cases where B >9 or C >9.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B'=B -10, so B' + C=17 -10=7. Number of solutions:8.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9:8.But we have to subtract the overlap where both B >9 and C >9: B' + C'=17 -10 -10= -3, which is impossible. So, total invalid solutions:8 +8=16.Therefore, number of valid solutions:18 -16=2.Wait, that seems off because B + C=17, with B and C at most9. The possible solutions are (8,9), (9,8). So, only 2 solutions. So, that's correct.Wait, so for A'=2, number of solutions is2.Similarly, for A'=3: B + C=16.Number of solutions without constraints:17.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B'=B -10, so B' + C=16 -10=6. Number of solutions:7.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9:7.Overlap: B' + C'=16 -10 -10= -4, impossible.So, total invalid solutions:7 +7=14.Number of valid solutions:17 -14=3.But wait, B + C=16, with B and C ≤9. The possible solutions are (7,9), (8,8), (9,7). So, 3 solutions. Correct.Similarly, for A'=4: B + C=15.Number of solutions without constraints:16.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B'=B -10, so B' + C=15 -10=5. Number of solutions:6.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9:6.Overlap: B' + C'=15 -10 -10= -5, impossible.Total invalid solutions:6 +6=12.Number of valid solutions:16 -12=4.Indeed, B + C=15: (6,9), (7,8), (8,7), (9,6). So, 4 solutions.A'=5: B + C=14.Number of solutions without constraints:15.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B'=B -10, so B' + C=14 -10=4. Number of solutions:5.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9:5.Overlap: B' + C'=14 -10 -10= -6, impossible.Total invalid solutions:5 +5=10.Number of valid solutions:15 -10=5.Indeed, B + C=14: (5,9), (6,8), (7,7), (8,6), (9,5). 5 solutions.A'=6: B + C=13.As before, number of solutions is6.Wait, let me compute it:Number of solutions without constraints:14.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B'=B -10, so B' + C=13 -10=3. Number of solutions:4.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9:4.Overlap: B' + C'=13 -10 -10= -7, impossible.Total invalid solutions:4 +4=8.Number of valid solutions:14 -8=6.Which corresponds to (4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (9,4). 6 solutions.A'=7: B + C=12.Number of solutions without constraints:13.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B'=B -10, so B' + C=12 -10=2. Number of solutions:3.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9:3.Overlap: B' + C'=12 -10 -10= -8, impossible.Total invalid solutions:3 +3=6.Number of valid solutions:13 -6=7.Which corresponds to (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3). 7 solutions.A'=8: B + C=11.Number of solutions without constraints:12.Number of solutions where B >9: Let B'=B -10, so B' + C=11 -10=1. Number of solutions:2.Similarly, number of solutions where C >9:2.Overlap: B' + C'=11 -10 -10= -9, impossible.Total invalid solutions:2 +2=4.Number of valid solutions:12 -4=8.Which corresponds to (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2). 8 solutions.So, summarizing:- A'=0: 0- A'=1:1- A'=2:2- A'=3:3- A'=4:4- A'=5:5- A'=6:6- A'=7:7- A'=8:8Adding these up: 0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 = 36.Yes, that's correct. So, the number of three-digit numbers with digit sum 20 is 36.**Total Count**Now, adding up the three cases:- S(n) =2: 3 numbers- S(n)=11:61 numbers- S(n)=20:36 numbersTotal numbers:3 +61 +36=100.Wait, that's interesting. So, the total number of three-digit numbers where S(S(n))=2 is 100.But let me just double-check my calculations because 100 seems a round number, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the case counts.Case 1: S(n)=2: 3 numbers. That seems correct because the only possibilities are 101, 110, 200.Case 2: S(n)=11:61 numbers. That seems plausible as 11 is a moderate digit sum.Case 3: S(n)=20:36 numbers. Also seems correct as 20 is a high digit sum, so fewer numbers.Adding them up:3 +61=64, 64 +36=100. Yes, that's correct.Therefore, the number of three-digit numbers n where S(S(n))=2 is 100.**Final Answer**The number of such three-digit numbers is boxed{100}."},{"question":"Find the sum of all the roots of the equation ( 4x^{2} - 58x + 190 = (29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: (4x^{2} - 58x + 190 = (29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x). The question is asking for the sum of all the roots of this equation. Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this.First, I know that when dealing with equations involving logarithms, it's often helpful to make a substitution to simplify the equation. In this case, the logarithm is base 2, so maybe I can let (y = log_{2} x). That might make things easier. Let me write that down:Let (y = log_{2} x). Then, by the definition of logarithm, (x = 2^{y}). Okay, so I can substitute (x) with (2^{y}) in the equation. Let me try that.Starting with the left side of the equation: (4x^{2} - 58x + 190). Substituting (x = 2^{y}), we get:(4(2^{y})^{2} - 58(2^{y}) + 190).Simplifying that, (4 cdot 2^{2y} - 58 cdot 2^{y} + 190). Hmm, that's (4 cdot 4^{y} - 58 cdot 2^{y} + 190). Not sure if that helps yet, but let's hold onto that.Now, the right side of the equation is ((29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x). Substituting (x = 2^{y}) and (y = log_{2} x), this becomes:((29 - 4 cdot 2^{y} - y) cdot y).So, expanding that, it's (29y - 4y cdot 2^{y} - y^{2}).Putting both sides together, the equation becomes:(4 cdot 4^{y} - 58 cdot 2^{y} + 190 = 29y - 4y cdot 2^{y} - y^{2}).Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Let's try that:(4 cdot 4^{y} - 58 cdot 2^{y} + 190 - 29y + 4y cdot 2^{y} + y^{2} = 0).Let me rearrange the terms to group similar ones:(4 cdot 4^{y} + (-58 cdot 2^{y} + 4y cdot 2^{y}) + y^{2} - 29y + 190 = 0).Factor out (2^{y}) from the middle terms:(4 cdot 4^{y} + ( -58 + 4y ) cdot 2^{y} + y^{2} - 29y + 190 = 0).Hmm, that's still a bit messy, but maybe I can express (4^{y}) as ((2^{2})^{y} = 2^{2y}), so (4^{y} = (2^{y})^{2}). Let me denote (t = 2^{y}). Then, (4^{y} = t^{2}). So, substituting (t) into the equation:(4t^{2} + (-58 + 4y)t + y^{2} - 29y + 190 = 0).Wait, but (t = 2^{y}), which is also related to (y). So, we have an equation involving both (t) and (y). This seems a bit tricky because it's not a straightforward polynomial equation in one variable. Maybe I need another substitution or a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps instead of substituting (y = log_{2} x), I can try to rearrange the original equation without substitution. Let me look back at the original equation:(4x^{2} - 58x + 190 = (29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x).Let me expand the right side:(29 cdot log_{2} x - 4x cdot log_{2} x - (log_{2} x)^{2}).So, the equation becomes:(4x^{2} - 58x + 190 = 29 cdot log_{2} x - 4x cdot log_{2} x - (log_{2} x)^{2}).Let me bring all terms to the left side:(4x^{2} - 58x + 190 - 29 cdot log_{2} x + 4x cdot log_{2} x + (log_{2} x)^{2} = 0).Hmm, this seems similar to what I had before. Maybe I can group terms differently. Let's see:Group the quadratic terms in (log_{2} x):((log_{2} x)^{2} + (4x - 29) cdot log_{2} x + (4x^{2} - 58x + 190) = 0).Yes, that looks better. So, it's a quadratic equation in terms of (log_{2} x). Let me denote (y = log_{2} x) again. Then, the equation becomes:(y^{2} + (4x - 29)y + (4x^{2} - 58x + 190) = 0).Wait, but (y = log_{2} x), so (x = 2^{y}). So, substituting (x = 2^{y}) into the equation, we get:(y^{2} + (4 cdot 2^{y} - 29)y + (4 cdot (2^{y})^{2} - 58 cdot 2^{y} + 190) = 0).Simplify that:(y^{2} + (4 cdot 2^{y} - 29)y + (4 cdot 4^{y} - 58 cdot 2^{y} + 190) = 0).Hmm, this seems similar to the equation I had earlier. Maybe I can factor this differently or find a way to express it in terms of (t = 2^{y}) again. Let me try that.Let (t = 2^{y}), so (4^{y} = t^{2}), and (y = log_{2} t). Substituting into the equation:((log_{2} t)^{2} + (4t - 29)log_{2} t + (4t^{2} - 58t + 190) = 0).Hmm, now we have an equation in terms of (t), but it's still a mix of polynomial and logarithmic terms. This seems complicated. Maybe I need a different strategy.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the original equation and see if I can factor it or find roots by inspection. Let me look at the original equation again:(4x^{2} - 58x + 190 = (29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x).Let me denote (u = log_{2} x), so (x = 2^{u}). Then, substituting into the equation, we get:(4(2^{u})^{2} - 58(2^{u}) + 190 = (29 - 4(2^{u}) - u) cdot u).Simplify:(4 cdot 4^{u} - 58 cdot 2^{u} + 190 = (29 - 4 cdot 2^{u} - u) cdot u).Expanding the right side:(29u - 4u cdot 2^{u} - u^{2}).So, bringing all terms to the left:(4 cdot 4^{u} - 58 cdot 2^{u} + 190 - 29u + 4u cdot 2^{u} + u^{2} = 0).Grouping similar terms:(4 cdot 4^{u} + (-58 + 4u) cdot 2^{u} + u^{2} - 29u + 190 = 0).This is similar to what I had before. Maybe I can factor this equation or find a substitution that simplifies it.Wait, let me think about the structure of the equation. It's a combination of exponential terms and polynomial terms. Maybe I can look for specific values of (u) that satisfy the equation.Let me try plugging in some integer values for (u) and see if the equation holds.First, let's try (u = 2):Left side: (4 cdot 4^{2} + (-58 + 4*2) cdot 2^{2} + 2^{2} - 29*2 + 190).Calculate each term:(4*16 = 64),(-58 + 8 = -50), so (-50 * 4 = -200),(4 - 58 + 190 = 136).So total: 64 - 200 + 136 = 0. Wow, that works! So (u = 2) is a solution.Now, let's try (u = 3):Left side: (4*4^{3} + (-58 + 4*3)*2^{3} + 3^{2} - 29*3 + 190).Calculate each term:(4*64 = 256),(-58 + 12 = -46), so (-46*8 = -368),(9 - 87 + 190 = 112).Total: 256 - 368 + 112 = 0. That also works! So (u = 3) is another solution.Hmm, interesting. Let me try (u = 4):Left side: (4*4^{4} + (-58 + 4*4)*2^{4} + 4^{2} - 29*4 + 190).Calculate each term:(4*256 = 1024),(-58 + 16 = -42), so (-42*16 = -672),(16 - 116 + 190 = 90).Total: 1024 - 672 + 90 = 442. Not zero, so (u = 4) is not a solution.How about (u = 1):Left side: (4*4^{1} + (-58 + 4*1)*2^{1} + 1^{2} - 29*1 + 190).Calculate:(4*4 = 16),(-58 + 4 = -54), so (-54*2 = -108),(1 - 29 + 190 = 162).Total: 16 - 108 + 162 = 70. Not zero.How about (u = 5):Left side: (4*4^{5} + (-58 + 4*5)*2^{5} + 5^{2} - 29*5 + 190).Calculate:(4*1024 = 4096),(-58 + 20 = -38), so (-38*32 = -1216),(25 - 145 + 190 = 70).Total: 4096 - 1216 + 70 = 3050. Not zero.Hmm, so far, only (u = 2) and (u = 3) are solutions. Maybe these are the only integer solutions. Let me check (u = 0):Left side: (4*4^{0} + (-58 + 4*0)*2^{0} + 0^{2} - 29*0 + 190).Calculate:(4*1 = 4),(-58*1 = -58),(0 - 0 + 190 = 190).Total: 4 - 58 + 190 = 136. Not zero.How about (u = -1):Left side: (4*4^{-1} + (-58 + 4*(-1))*2^{-1} + (-1)^{2} - 29*(-1) + 190).Calculate:(4*(1/4) = 1),(-58 -4 = -62), so (-62*(1/2) = -31),(1 + 29 + 190 = 220).Total: 1 - 31 + 220 = 190. Not zero.Okay, so it seems that (u = 2) and (u = 3) are solutions. Since the equation is quadratic in (u), maybe these are the only solutions. Let me check if that's the case.Wait, the equation after substitution was quadratic in (u), but with coefficients that depend on (u) as well because of the (2^{u}) terms. So, it's not a standard quadratic equation. Therefore, it might have more solutions beyond (u = 2) and (u = 3). Hmm, but when I tried (u = 4) and (u = 5), it didn't work. Maybe these are the only solutions.Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be factored in terms of (u). Let me see.Looking back at the equation:(4 cdot 4^{u} + (-58 + 4u) cdot 2^{u} + u^{2} - 29u + 190 = 0).Let me factor out (2^{u}) from the first two terms:(2^{u}(4 cdot 2^{u} + (-58 + 4u)) + u^{2} - 29u + 190 = 0).Hmm, that might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the entire equation as a product of two terms involving (2^{u}) and (u). Let me think.Wait, since (u = 2) and (u = 3) are solutions, maybe the equation can be factored as ((u - 2)(u - 3)) times something. Let me try that.Assume the equation can be written as ((u - 2)(u - 3) cdot f(u) = 0), where (f(u)) is some function. Let me see if that's possible.But the equation is not a polynomial, so factoring might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since (u = 2) and (u = 3) are roots, the equation might have only these two roots, and thus the sum of the roots would be (2 + 3 = 5). But I need to confirm if these are the only roots.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the original equation and see if it's quadratic in (log_{2} x), so perhaps it can have at most two solutions. Let me check.Looking back at the original equation:(4x^{2} - 58x + 190 = (29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x).We can rewrite this as:((log_{2} x)^2 + (4x - 29)log_{2} x + (4x^2 - 58x + 190) = 0).This is a quadratic equation in (log_{2} x), so for each (x), there can be at most two solutions for (log_{2} x). However, since (log_{2} x) is a function, each solution for (log_{2} x) corresponds to exactly one (x). Therefore, the equation can have at most two real solutions for (x).But wait, when I substituted (u = log_{2} x), I found that (u = 2) and (u = 3) are solutions, which correspond to (x = 2^{2} = 4) and (x = 2^{3} = 8). So, these are two solutions. Are there any more solutions?Let me check (x = 4) and (x = 8) in the original equation to confirm.First, (x = 4):Left side: (4*(4)^2 - 58*4 + 190 = 4*16 - 232 + 190 = 64 - 232 + 190 = 22).Right side: ((29 - 4*4 - log_{2}4) * log_{2}4 = (29 - 16 - 2) * 2 = (11) * 2 = 22).So, it works.Now, (x = 8):Left side: (4*(8)^2 - 58*8 + 190 = 4*64 - 464 + 190 = 256 - 464 + 190 = 82).Right side: ((29 - 4*8 - log_{2}8) * log_{2}8 = (29 - 32 - 3) * 3 = (-6) * 3 = -18).Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?Wait, let me recalculate the right side for (x = 8):((29 - 4*8 - log_{2}8) * log_{2}8).Calculate each part:(4*8 = 32),(log_{2}8 = 3),So, inside the parentheses: (29 - 32 - 3 = -6),Multiply by (log_{2}8 = 3): (-6 * 3 = -18).Left side was 82, right side is -18. They don't match. Hmm, that's a problem. So, (x = 8) is not a solution? But earlier, when I substituted (u = 3), it worked in the transformed equation. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution process.Wait, let's go back. When I substituted (u = log_{2} x), I got the equation:(4 cdot 4^{u} + (-58 + 4u) cdot 2^{u} + u^{2} - 29u + 190 = 0).When (u = 3), substituting back:(4*64 + (-58 + 12)*8 + 9 - 87 + 190).Calculate:(256 + (-46)*8 + 9 - 87 + 190).Which is (256 - 368 + 9 - 87 + 190).Adding up: 256 - 368 = -112; -112 + 9 = -103; -103 - 87 = -190; -190 + 190 = 0. So, it works in the transformed equation.But when I plug (x = 8) into the original equation, it doesn't work. That suggests that (u = 3) is a solution to the transformed equation, but (x = 8) is not a solution to the original equation. That's confusing.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check.Original substitution: (u = log_{2} x), so (x = 2^{u}).Original equation: (4x^{2} - 58x + 190 = (29 - 4x - u) * u).So, substituting (x = 2^{u}):Left side: (4*(2^{u})^{2} - 58*(2^{u}) + 190 = 4*4^{u} - 58*2^{u} + 190).Right side: ((29 - 4*2^{u} - u) * u = 29u - 4u*2^{u} - u^{2}).So, bringing all terms to the left:(4*4^{u} - 58*2^{u} + 190 - 29u + 4u*2^{u} + u^{2} = 0).Which simplifies to:(4*4^{u} + (-58 + 4u)*2^{u} + u^{2} - 29u + 190 = 0).So, when (u = 3), this equation equals zero, as we saw. But when (x = 8), which is (u = 3), the original equation doesn't hold. That suggests that there might be an extraneous solution introduced during the substitution.Wait, that can't be. Because substitution should preserve the solutions. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the original equation for (x = 8). Let me recalculate.Original equation for (x = 8):Left side: (4*(8)^2 - 58*8 + 190 = 4*64 - 464 + 190 = 256 - 464 + 190).Calculate step by step:256 - 464 = -208,-208 + 190 = -18.Right side: ((29 - 4*8 - log_{2}8) * log_{2}8 = (29 - 32 - 3) * 3 = (-6) * 3 = -18).Wait, so both sides are -18. So, they do match! I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation. So, (x = 8) is indeed a solution.Wait, so earlier I thought the left side was 82, but that was incorrect. Let me recalculate:Left side: (4*(8)^2 = 4*64 = 256),(58*8 = 464),So, (256 - 464 + 190 = (256 + 190) - 464 = 446 - 464 = -18).Yes, that's correct. So, both sides are -18. So, (x = 8) is a valid solution. I must have miscalculated earlier.So, both (x = 4) and (x = 8) are solutions. Therefore, the equation has two real roots: 4 and 8. Therefore, the sum of all roots is (4 + 8 = 12).But wait, let me make sure there are no other solutions. Since the equation is quadratic in (log_{2} x), it can have at most two solutions. So, if we've found two solutions, that's it. Therefore, the sum is 12.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other possible solutions. Maybe by graphing or considering the behavior of the functions.Let me consider the original equation:(4x^{2} - 58x + 190 = (29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x).Let me denote (f(x) = 4x^{2} - 58x + 190) and (g(x) = (29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x).I can analyze the behavior of (f(x)) and (g(x)) to see if they intersect only at (x = 4) and (x = 8).First, note that (x > 0) because of the logarithm.Let me consider the behavior as (x) approaches 0 from the right:- (f(x)) approaches (0 - 0 + 190 = 190).- (g(x)) involves (log_{2} x), which approaches (-infty). So, (g(x)) approaches ((29 - 0 - (-infty)) cdot (-infty)), which is ((+infty) cdot (-infty) = -infty).So, as (x to 0^+), (f(x) to 190) and (g(x) to -infty). Therefore, (f(x) > g(x)) near 0.As (x) increases:- (f(x)) is a quadratic opening upwards, so it will eventually increase to infinity.- (g(x)) is a product of a linear term and a logarithmic term. Let's see:(g(x) = (29 - 4x - log_{2} x) cdot log_{2} x).As (x) increases, (29 - 4x) becomes negative, and (log_{2} x) increases. So, (g(x)) will eventually become negative because (29 - 4x) dominates and becomes negative, multiplied by a positive (log_{2} x).Therefore, as (x to infty), (f(x) to infty) and (g(x) to -infty). So, (f(x) > g(x)) as (x) becomes large.Now, let's check the behavior around (x = 4) and (x = 8):At (x = 4), both sides equal 22.At (x = 8), both sides equal -18.Let me check the value at (x = 2):Left side: (4*4 - 58*2 + 190 = 16 - 116 + 190 = 90).Right side: ((29 - 8 - 1) * 1 = 20 * 1 = 20). So, (f(2) = 90), (g(2) = 20). So, (f(x) > g(x)).At (x = 1):Left side: (4 - 58 + 190 = 136).Right side: ((29 - 4 - 0) * 0 = 25 * 0 = 0). So, (f(x) > g(x)).At (x = 16):Left side: (4*256 - 58*16 + 190 = 1024 - 928 + 190 = 286).Right side: ((29 - 64 - 4) * 4 = (-39) * 4 = -156). So, (f(x) > g(x)).So, between (x = 4) and (x = 8), let's see:At (x = 6):Left side: (4*36 - 58*6 + 190 = 144 - 348 + 190 = -14).Right side: ((29 - 24 - log_{2}6) * log_{2}6).Calculate (log_{2}6 approx 2.58496).So, inside the parentheses: (29 - 24 - 2.58496 ≈ 2.41504).Multiply by (log_{2}6 ≈ 2.58496): (2.41504 * 2.58496 ≈ 6.24).So, left side ≈ -14, right side ≈ 6.24. Therefore, (f(x) < g(x)) at (x = 6).So, between (x = 4) and (x = 6), (f(x)) goes from 22 to -14, while (g(x)) goes from 22 to approximately 6.24. So, they cross at (x = 4), and then (f(x)) becomes less than (g(x)) somewhere between (x = 4) and (x = 6).Wait, but we already have solutions at (x = 4) and (x = 8). Let me check at (x = 7):Left side: (4*49 - 58*7 + 190 = 196 - 406 + 190 = 80).Right side: ((29 - 28 - log_{2}7) * log_{2}7).Calculate (log_{2}7 ≈ 2.8074).Inside the parentheses: (29 - 28 - 2.8074 ≈ -1.8074).Multiply by (log_{2}7 ≈ 2.8074): (-1.8074 * 2.8074 ≈ -5.08).So, left side ≈ 80, right side ≈ -5.08. So, (f(x) > g(x)) at (x = 7).Wait, so at (x = 6), (f(x) ≈ -14), (g(x) ≈ 6.24); at (x = 7), (f(x) ≈ 80), (g(x) ≈ -5.08). So, between (x = 6) and (x = 7), (f(x)) goes from -14 to 80, while (g(x)) goes from 6.24 to -5.08. Therefore, they must cross somewhere between (x = 6) and (x = 7). But we already have solutions at (x = 4) and (x = 8). Hmm, does that mean there's another solution?Wait, but earlier, when I solved the transformed equation, I only found (u = 2) and (u = 3) as solutions, which correspond to (x = 4) and (x = 8). So, why does the graph suggest another crossing?Wait, perhaps my analysis is incorrect. Let me think again.The equation is quadratic in (log_{2} x), so it can have at most two solutions. Therefore, even though the functions (f(x)) and (g(x)) might seem to cross more than twice, the equation can only have two solutions because of the substitution. So, perhaps the crossing between (x = 6) and (x = 7) is not a solution to the original equation, but rather an artifact of the functions' behavior.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the transformed equation only has two solutions. Let me check the transformed equation again:(4 cdot 4^{u} + (-58 + 4u) cdot 2^{u} + u^{2} - 29u + 190 = 0).We found (u = 2) and (u = 3) as solutions. Let me see if there are any other solutions.Let me try (u = 1):Left side: (4*4 + (-58 + 4)*2 + 1 - 29 + 190 = 16 + (-54)*2 + 1 - 29 + 190 = 16 - 108 + 1 - 29 + 190 = 70). Not zero.(u = 4):Left side: (4*256 + (-58 + 16)*16 + 16 - 116 + 190 = 1024 + (-42)*16 + 16 - 116 + 190 = 1024 - 672 + 16 - 116 + 190 = 442). Not zero.(u = 5):Left side: (4*1024 + (-58 + 20)*32 + 25 - 145 + 190 = 4096 + (-38)*32 + 25 - 145 + 190 = 4096 - 1216 + 25 - 145 + 190 = 3050). Not zero.How about (u = 0):Left side: (4*1 + (-58 + 0)*1 + 0 - 0 + 190 = 4 - 58 + 190 = 136). Not zero.(u = -1):Left side: (4*(1/4) + (-58 -4)*(1/2) + 1 + 29 + 190 = 1 + (-62)*(1/2) + 220 = 1 - 31 + 220 = 190). Not zero.So, it seems that (u = 2) and (u = 3) are the only integer solutions. Since the equation is quadratic in (u), but with coefficients depending on (u), it's not a standard quadratic, so it might have more solutions, but from testing, it seems only (u = 2) and (u = 3) satisfy the equation.Therefore, the original equation has two solutions: (x = 4) and (x = 8). Therefore, the sum of all roots is (4 + 8 = 12).I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:1. Substituted (u = log_{2} x) to transform the equation into a quadratic in (u).2. Found that (u = 2) and (u = 3) are solutions.3. Converted back to (x) to get (x = 4) and (x = 8).4. Verified both solutions in the original equation.5. Checked the behavior of the functions to ensure no other solutions exist.6. Concluded that the sum is 12.Yeah, that seems solid."},{"question":"If the set {(x, y) | x + y - 2 = 0 text{ and } x - 2y + 4 = 0} is a proper subset of {(x, y) | y = 3x + b}, then find b.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of ( b ) such that the set ( {(x, y) | x + y - 2 = 0 text{ and } x - 2y + 4 = 0} ) is a proper subset of ( {(x, y) | y = 3x + b} ). Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, I know that a proper subset means that every element of the first set is also in the second set, but the second set has at least one more element. So, essentially, the solution to the system of equations given by the first set must lie on the line ( y = 3x + b ). Therefore, if I can find the solution to the system of equations, I can plug those ( x ) and ( y ) values into the equation of the line to solve for ( b ).Alright, let's write down the two equations:1. ( x + y - 2 = 0 )  → Let me rewrite this as ( x + y = 2 ).2. ( x - 2y + 4 = 0 ) → Similarly, this can be written as ( x - 2y = -4 ).So now, I have the system:1. ( x + y = 2 )2. ( x - 2y = -4 )I need to solve this system to find the point ( (x, y) ) that satisfies both equations. Once I have that point, since it's a proper subset, this point must lie on the line ( y = 3x + b ). So, plugging ( x ) and ( y ) into this equation will allow me to solve for ( b ).Let me solve the system of equations. I can use either substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination because the coefficients of ( x ) are the same in both equations.If I subtract the second equation from the first, that might help. Wait, actually, let me write them down:Equation 1: ( x + y = 2 )Equation 2: ( x - 2y = -4 )If I subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1, I get:( (x + y) - (x - 2y) = 2 - (-4) )Simplifying the left side:( x + y - x + 2y = 3y )And the right side:( 2 + 4 = 6 )So, ( 3y = 6 ) → ( y = 2 ).Now that I have ( y = 2 ), I can plug this back into Equation 1 to find ( x ):( x + 2 = 2 ) → ( x = 0 ).So, the solution to the system is ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 2 ). Therefore, the set ( {(x, y) | x + y - 2 = 0 text{ and } x - 2y + 4 = 0} ) is just the single point ( (0, 2) ).Now, since this set is a proper subset of ( {(x, y) | y = 3x + b} ), the point ( (0, 2) ) must lie on the line ( y = 3x + b ). Let's plug ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 2 ) into this equation:( 2 = 3(0) + b ) → ( 2 = 0 + b ) → ( b = 2 ).Wait, hold on. Is that all? Let me double-check. So, the point ( (0, 2) ) lies on the line ( y = 3x + b ), so substituting gives ( b = 2 ). That seems straightforward.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me verify the solution to the system again. Plugging ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 2 ) into both equations:1. ( 0 + 2 - 2 = 0 ) → ( 0 = 0 ) ✔️2. ( 0 - 2(2) + 4 = 0 ) → ( 0 - 4 + 4 = 0 ) → ( 0 = 0 ) ✔️Okay, so the solution is correct. Therefore, ( b = 2 ) is the right answer.But wait, the problem says it's a proper subset. So, the set containing just ( (0, 2) ) is a proper subset of the line ( y = 3x + b ). That makes sense because a line has infinitely many points, so a single point is definitely a proper subset. So, as long as ( (0, 2) ) is on the line, it's fine.Is there any other condition I need to consider? Maybe if the entire line ( x + y = 2 ) or ( x - 2y = -4 ) was a subset, but no, the set is the intersection of both, which is just the single point. So, yeah, ( b = 2 ) is correct.I think that's all. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I feel confident that ( b = 2 ) is the answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( b ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"The image of the point with coordinates (1,1) under the reflection across the line y=mx+b is the point with coordinates (9,5).  Find m+b.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of m and b, where the line y = mx + b is the mirror across which the point (1,1) reflects to the point (9,5). Hmm, reflections... I remember that reflecting a point over a line involves some midpoint and perpendicularity. Let me try to recall the exact steps.First, if I reflect a point over a line, the line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the original point and its image. That means two things: the midpoint of the segment connecting (1,1) and (9,5) lies on the line y = mx + b, and the line is perpendicular to the segment connecting these two points.So, let me find the midpoint first. The midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). Plugging in the values, that would be ((1 + 9)/2, (1 + 5)/2) = (10/2, 6/2) = (5, 3). So, the midpoint is (5,3). This point must lie on the line y = mx + b. Therefore, plugging into the equation: 3 = m*5 + b. So, equation one is 5m + b = 3.Next, I need to find the slope of the line segment connecting (1,1) and (9,5). The slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). So, that's (5 - 1)/(9 - 1) = 4/8 = 1/2. Therefore, the slope of the segment is 1/2. Since the line y = mx + b is perpendicular to this segment, its slope m must be the negative reciprocal of 1/2. The negative reciprocal of 1/2 is -2. So, m = -2.Wait, hold on. If the segment has a slope of 1/2, then the perpendicular line should have a slope of -2. That seems right because the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is -1. So, 1/2 * (-2) = -1, which checks out.So, now that I know m is -2, I can plug that back into the first equation to find b. The first equation was 5m + b = 3. Substituting m = -2, we get 5*(-2) + b = 3 => -10 + b = 3 => b = 13.Therefore, m is -2 and b is 13, so m + b is -2 + 13 = 11.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, midpoint is (5,3). Plugging into y = mx + b gives 3 = 5m + b. Then, slope of the segment is 1/2, so the perpendicular slope is -2. Plugging m = -2 into the equation gives 3 = 5*(-2) + b => 3 = -10 + b => b = 13. So, m + b is indeed 11.Just to be thorough, let me verify that reflecting (1,1) over the line y = -2x + 13 gives (9,5). How do I do that? Well, the reflection of a point over a line can be found using the formula, but since I don't remember it exactly, maybe I can use the midpoint and the perpendicular line.Let me consider the line y = -2x + 13. The point (1,1) should reflect over this line to (9,5). Let me check if the midpoint is indeed on the line. Midpoint is (5,3). Plugging into the line: y = -2*5 + 13 = -10 + 13 = 3. Yes, that's correct.Also, the line connecting (1,1) and (9,5) has a slope of 1/2, and the line y = -2x + 13 has a slope of -2, which is perpendicular. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, I can use the formula for reflection over a line. The formula for reflecting a point (x, y) over the line ax + by + c = 0 is:x' = (x(b² - a²) - 2a(b y + c)) / (a² + b²)y' = (y(a² - b²) - 2b(a x + c)) / (a² + b²)Wait, actually, I think I might be mixing up the formula. Maybe it's better to use another method.Alternatively, the reflection can be found by solving the system where the line is the perpendicular bisector. So, given a point (x, y), its reflection (x', y') satisfies two conditions: the midpoint between (x, y) and (x', y') lies on the line, and the line is perpendicular to the segment connecting (x, y) and (x', y').In this case, we already used that to find m and b, so I think our previous steps are correct.Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the reflection. Let me try that.Let me denote the original point as P(1,1) and its reflection as P'(9,5). The line of reflection is L: y = -2x + 13.The reflection of a point over a line can be found by finding the perpendicular projection of the point onto the line and then moving the same distance beyond the projection.So, let me find the projection of P(1,1) onto L.The formula for the projection of a point (x0, y0) onto the line ax + by + c = 0 is:x = (b(bx0 - ay0) - ac) / (a² + b²)y = (a(-bx0 + ay0) - bc) / (a² + b²)Wait, actually, I think it's better to write the line in standard form. Our line is y = -2x + 13, which can be rewritten as 2x + y - 13 = 0. So, a = 2, b = 1, c = -13.So, the projection of P(1,1) onto L is given by:x = (b²x0 - ab y0 - ac) / (a² + b²)y = (-ab x0 + a² y0 - bc) / (a² + b²)Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to use another method.Alternatively, the projection point Q can be found by solving the system where Q lies on L and the line PQ is perpendicular to L.So, let me denote Q as (x, y). Since Q lies on L, y = -2x + 13.Also, the slope of PQ is (y - 1)/(x - 1). Since PQ is perpendicular to L, which has slope -2, the slope of PQ must be 1/2.So, (y - 1)/(x - 1) = 1/2.But y = -2x + 13, so substituting:(-2x + 13 - 1)/(x - 1) = 1/2Simplify numerator: (-2x + 12)/(x - 1) = 1/2Cross-multiplying: 2*(-2x + 12) = 1*(x - 1)=> -4x + 24 = x - 1Bring all terms to left: -4x + 24 - x + 1 = 0 => -5x + 25 = 0 => -5x = -25 => x = 5Then, y = -2*5 + 13 = -10 + 13 = 3. So, the projection point Q is (5,3), which is the midpoint we found earlier. That makes sense because the reflection over the line would mean that Q is the midpoint between P and P'.So, since Q is (5,3), and P is (1,1), then P' should be (9,5), which is exactly what the problem states. So, that checks out.Therefore, I think our earlier conclusion that m = -2 and b = 13 is correct, so m + b = 11.Just to recap, the steps were:1. Find the midpoint between (1,1) and (9,5), which is (5,3). This lies on the reflection line.2. Find the slope of the segment connecting (1,1) and (9,5), which is 1/2. The reflection line must be perpendicular, so its slope is -2.3. Use the midpoint (5,3) and slope -2 to find the equation of the line, which gives y = -2x + 13.4. Therefore, m = -2 and b = 13, so m + b = 11.Everything seems consistent, so I think the answer is 11.**Final Answer**boxed{11}"},{"question":"Simplify frac{1}{1+sqrt{2}}cdotfrac{1}{1-sqrt{2}}.","answer":"To simplify the expression (frac{1}{1+sqrt{2}} cdot frac{1}{1-sqrt{2}}), I first recognize that multiplying the two fractions will combine their denominators.Multiplying the denominators ((1+sqrt{2})) and ((1-sqrt{2})) results in a difference of squares, which simplifies to (1 - (sqrt{2})^2).

Which of the following is closest to the airplane's altitude, in miles?textbf{(A)} 3.5 qquadtextbf{(B)} 4 qquadtextbf{(C)} 4.5 qquadtextbf{(D)} 5 qquadtextbf{(E)} 5.5","answer":"Okay, so Alice and Bob live 10 miles apart. Alice is looking north and sees an airplane at a 30-degree elevation angle, while Bob is looking west and sees the same airplane at a 60-degree elevation angle. I need to find the airplane's altitude, and the options are from 3.5 to 5.5 miles. Hmm, let me visualize this.First, let me sketch a diagram in my mind. Alice is at point A, Bob is at point B, and the airplane is at point P in the sky. Since Alice is looking north and Bob is looking west, their lines of sight form a right angle on the ground. The distance between Alice and Bob is 10 miles, so that's the straight line between points A and B.Now, the airplane is somewhere above the ground, forming two right triangles with Alice and Bob. From Alice's perspective, the triangle has an angle of elevation of 30 degrees, and from Bob's perspective, it's 60 degrees. The altitude of the airplane is the same for both triangles, so let me denote that as 'h' miles.Let me denote the horizontal distance from Alice to the point directly below the airplane as 'x' miles, and the horizontal distance from Bob to that same point as 'y' miles. Since Alice and Bob are 10 miles apart, and their lines of sight are perpendicular, the triangle formed by Alice, Bob, and the point below the airplane is a right triangle with legs x and y, and hypotenuse 10 miles. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, x² + y² = 10² = 100.Now, looking at Alice's triangle, which is a right triangle with angle 30 degrees. The tangent of 30 degrees is equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side, which is h/x. So, tan(30°) = h/x. Similarly, for Bob's triangle with angle 60 degrees, tan(60°) = h/y.I remember that tan(30°) is 1/√3 and tan(60°) is √3. So, substituting these values:From Alice: h = x * tan(30°) = x / √3From Bob: h = y * tan(60°) = y * √3So, we have two expressions for h:1. h = x / √32. h = y * √3Since both equal h, I can set them equal to each other:x / √3 = y * √3Multiplying both sides by √3 to eliminate the denominator:x = y * (√3 * √3) = y * 3So, x = 3yNow, we know from the Pythagorean theorem that x² + y² = 100. Substituting x with 3y:(3y)² + y² = 1009y² + y² = 10010y² = 100y² = 10y = √10So, y is √10 miles. Then, x is 3y, which is 3√10 miles.Now, let's find h using one of the expressions. Let's use h = y * √3:h = √10 * √3 = √30Hmm, √30 is approximately 5.477 miles. Wait, but the options are 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5. So, 5.477 is closest to 5.5, but let me double-check my calculations because 5.5 is an option, but maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me check the steps again. So, we had x = 3y, then x² + y² = 100, which becomes 9y² + y² = 10y² = 100, so y² = 10, y = √10. Then, h = y * √3 = √10 * √3 = √30 ≈ 5.477. So, that's approximately 5.5 miles, which is option E.But wait, the options are A)3.5, B)4, C)4.5, D)5, E)5.5. So, 5.477 is indeed closest to 5.5. But wait, let me think again because sometimes these problems can have a different approach.Alternatively, maybe I should use the sine function instead of tangent? Let me see. If I consider the angle of elevation, then the sine of the angle would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is h / (distance from observer to airplane). But I don't know the distance from Alice or Bob to the airplane. Wait, but I can express that distance in terms of h.From Alice's perspective, the line of sight distance is the hypotenuse of her triangle, which would be h / sin(30°). Similarly, from Bob's perspective, it's h / sin(60°). But since the airplane is the same, those two hypotenuses should relate to the horizontal distances x and y.Wait, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in 3D? Because the airplane is in the air, so the distance from Alice to the airplane is sqrt(x² + h²), and from Bob to the airplane is sqrt(y² + h²). But since Alice and Bob are 10 miles apart on the ground, the distance between their houses is 10 miles, which is the straight line on the ground. However, the airplane's position forms a right triangle with both Alice and Bob, so maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem in 3D.Wait, actually, the airplane, Alice, and Bob form a right-angled tetrahedron. The distance from Alice to Bob is 10 miles, and the distances from Alice to the airplane and Bob to the airplane can be found using their respective angles of elevation.But maybe that's complicating things. Let me go back to my initial approach.I had h = x / √3 and h = y * √3, leading to x = 3y. Then, x² + y² = 100, so 9y² + y² = 10y² = 100, so y² = 10, y = √10 ≈ 3.162 miles. Then, h = y * √3 ≈ 3.162 * 1.732 ≈ 5.477 miles. So, that's approximately 5.5 miles, which is option E.But wait, the answer choices don't have 5.5 as the closest to 5.477? Wait, 5.477 is just slightly less than 5.5, but it's still closer to 5.5 than to 5. Because 5.477 is only 0.023 away from 5.5, whereas it's 0.477 away from 5. So, yes, it's closer to 5.5.But let me check if I made a mistake in the initial setup. Because sometimes, when dealing with angles of elevation, the horizontal distance is not the same as the line of sight distance.Wait, no, in the tangent function, it's opposite over adjacent, which is h over the horizontal distance. So, that part is correct.Alternatively, maybe I should use the sine function. Let me try that.From Alice's perspective, sin(30°) = h / d1, where d1 is the line of sight distance from Alice to the airplane. Similarly, sin(60°) = h / d2, where d2 is the line of sight distance from Bob to the airplane.So, d1 = h / sin(30°) = h / 0.5 = 2hd2 = h / sin(60°) = h / (√3 / 2) = 2h / √3Now, the distance between Alice and Bob is 10 miles, which is the straight line on the ground. But the airplane is above the ground, so the distance between Alice and Bob in 3D space would be sqrt(d1² + d2² - 2*d1*d2*cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between their lines of sight. But since Alice is looking north and Bob is looking west, their lines of sight are perpendicular, so theta is 90 degrees. Therefore, cos(theta) is 0.So, the distance between Alice and Bob in 3D space is sqrt(d1² + d2²). But wait, actually, the distance between Alice and Bob on the ground is 10 miles, but in 3D, it's the same because the airplane's altitude doesn't affect the distance between Alice and Bob. Wait, no, that's not correct. The distance between Alice and Bob is 10 miles on the ground, but the airplane is somewhere above the ground, so the lines of sight from Alice and Bob to the airplane form a triangle in 3D space.Wait, perhaps I should model this as a right triangle in 3D. Let me think.The airplane is at point P, with coordinates (x, y, h), where x is the distance east from Alice, y is the distance south from Bob, and h is the altitude. Since Alice is looking north, her line of sight is along the y-axis, and Bob is looking west, his line of sight is along the x-axis. So, the point directly below the airplane is at (x, y, 0), and the distance from Alice to this point is x miles, and from Bob to this point is y miles. The distance between Alice and Bob is sqrt(x² + y²) = 10 miles.From Alice's perspective, the angle of elevation is 30 degrees, so tan(30°) = h / x => h = x * tan(30°) = x / √3From Bob's perspective, tan(60°) = h / y => h = y * tan(60°) = y * √3So, h = x / √3 and h = y * √3, which gives x = 3y, as before.Then, x² + y² = 100 => (3y)² + y² = 9y² + y² = 10y² = 100 => y² = 10 => y = √10 ≈ 3.162 milesThen, h = y * √3 ≈ 3.162 * 1.732 ≈ 5.477 miles, which is approximately 5.5 miles.So, the closest answer is E) 5.5.Wait, but the options are A)3.5, B)4, C)4.5, D)5, E)5.5. So, 5.477 is indeed closest to 5.5.But let me check if I made a mistake in interpreting the angles. Sometimes, elevation angles can be measured differently, but I think in this context, it's the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight, which is the standard definition.Alternatively, maybe I should use the Pythagorean theorem in a different way. Let me think.If I consider the horizontal distances x and y, and the altitude h, then from Alice's perspective, the line of sight distance is sqrt(x² + h²), and from Bob's perspective, it's sqrt(y² + h²). The angle of elevation is related to these distances.But I think my initial approach is correct because I used the tangent function, which relates the opposite side (h) to the adjacent side (x or y). So, I think the answer is indeed approximately 5.5 miles.Wait, but let me calculate √30 more accurately. √30 is approximately 5.47722557505, which is about 5.477 miles. So, 5.477 is closer to 5.5 than to 5 because 5.477 - 5 = 0.477, and 5.5 - 5.477 = 0.023. So, yes, it's much closer to 5.5.Therefore, the answer should be E) 5.5.Wait, but the options are given, and E is 5.5, which is the closest. So, I think that's correct.But just to make sure, let me try another approach. Let's denote the horizontal distance from Alice as x and from Bob as y, with x² + y² = 100.From Alice: h = x tan(30) = x / √3From Bob: h = y tan(60) = y √3So, x / √3 = y √3 => x = 3yThen, x² + y² = 100 => 9y² + y² = 10y² = 100 => y² = 10 => y = √10Then, h = y √3 = √10 * √3 = √30 ≈ 5.477So, yes, same result. So, the answer is E) 5.5.Wait, but the options are A)3.5, B)4, C)4.5, D)5, E)5.5. So, 5.477 is closest to 5.5, which is E.But wait, the problem says \\"closest to the airplane's altitude, in miles.\\" So, 5.477 is approximately 5.5, so E is correct.Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the answer might be 5 because sometimes problems expect rounding down, but in this case, 5.477 is much closer to 5.5 than to 5.Wait, let me check the exact value of √30. √25 is 5, √30 is about 5.477, √36 is 6. So, yes, 5.477 is closer to 5.5.Therefore, the answer is E) 5.5.But wait, the options are given, and E is 5.5, which is the closest. So, I think that's correct.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me consider that the airplane is not directly above the line connecting Alice and Bob, but somewhere else. Wait, no, because Alice is looking north and Bob is looking west, so the point directly below the airplane must lie somewhere on the line connecting Alice and Bob, but since they are 10 miles apart, and their lines of sight are perpendicular, the point below the airplane must form a right triangle with Alice and Bob.Wait, no, actually, the point directly below the airplane is not necessarily on the line connecting Alice and Bob. Wait, that's a good point. Because Alice is looking north, and Bob is looking west, the point directly below the airplane could be anywhere, not necessarily on the line connecting Alice and Bob.Wait, that complicates things. So, maybe my initial assumption that x² + y² = 100 is incorrect because x and y are not the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse 10 miles. Instead, the distance between Alice and Bob is 10 miles, but the point directly below the airplane is somewhere else, not necessarily forming a right triangle with Alice and Bob.Wait, that changes everything. So, perhaps I need to model this differently.Let me denote Alice's position as point A, Bob's position as point B, and the point directly below the airplane as point O. The distance between A and B is 10 miles. Alice looks north and sees the airplane at a 30-degree angle, so the line AO is the horizontal distance from Alice to O, and the angle between AO and the line of sight AP is 30 degrees. Similarly, Bob looks west and sees the airplane at a 60-degree angle, so the line BO is the horizontal distance from Bob to O, and the angle between BO and the line of sight BP is 60 degrees.So, in this case, the triangle AOB is a triangle with sides AO, BO, and AB = 10 miles. The angles at A and B are not necessarily 90 degrees because O is not necessarily on the line AB. Wait, but Alice is looking north and Bob is looking west, so if Alice is at (0,0) and Bob is at (10,0), then Alice looks along the positive y-axis, and Bob looks along the negative x-axis. So, the point O would be at (x, y), where x is west of Bob and y is north of Alice. So, the distance from Alice to O is sqrt(x² + y²), but wait, no, because Alice is looking north, so her horizontal distance to O is y, and Bob is looking west, so his horizontal distance to O is x. Wait, no, if Alice is at (0,0) and Bob is at (10,0), then Alice looks north along the positive y-axis, so the point O would be at (0, y), and Bob looks west along the negative x-axis, so the point O would be at (x, 0). But that would mean that O is at the intersection of Alice's north and Bob's west, which would be at (0,0), but that can't be because then the airplane would be at (0,0, h), but Alice and Bob are 10 miles apart, so that doesn't make sense.Wait, perhaps I need to model this with coordinates. Let me set Alice at (0,0,0) and Bob at (10,0,0). Alice looks north, which is along the positive y-axis, and Bob looks west, which is along the negative x-axis. The airplane is at some point (x, y, h). From Alice's perspective, the line of sight is from (0,0,0) to (x, y, h), and the angle of elevation is 30 degrees. Similarly, from Bob's perspective, the line of sight is from (10,0,0) to (x, y, h), with an angle of elevation of 60 degrees.Wait, but if Alice is looking north, then her line of sight should be along the y-axis, so x should be 0? No, because if Alice is at (0,0,0) and looks north, her line of sight is along the positive y-axis, so the airplane must be somewhere along the line (0, y, h). Similarly, Bob is at (10,0,0) and looks west, so his line of sight is along the negative x-axis, so the airplane must be somewhere along the line (x, 0, h). But that would mean that the airplane is at the intersection of these two lines, which is only possible if x=0 and y=0, but that would put the airplane at (0,0,h), which is directly above Alice, but then Bob's line of sight would have to be from (10,0,0) to (0,0,h), which is a distance of sqrt(10² + h²), and the angle of elevation would be arctan(h / 10). But in the problem, Bob's angle is 60 degrees, so arctan(h / 10) = 60 degrees, which would mean h = 10 tan(60) = 10√3 ≈ 17.32 miles, which is way higher than the options given. So, that can't be right.Wait, so my initial assumption that Alice is at (0,0,0) and Bob at (10,0,0) might not be the best approach because the airplane can't be on both the north line from Alice and the west line from Bob unless it's at (0,0,h), which leads to a contradiction with Bob's angle.Therefore, perhaps the point O, directly below the airplane, is not on the line connecting Alice and Bob, but somewhere else. So, let me denote Alice's position as A(0,0,0), Bob's position as B(10,0,0), and the point directly below the airplane as O(x,y,0). The airplane is at P(x,y,h).From Alice's perspective, the line of sight is from A(0,0,0) to P(x,y,h), and the angle of elevation is 30 degrees. The horizontal distance from Alice to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The angle of elevation is the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight, so tan(30°) = h / sqrt(x² + y²).Similarly, from Bob's perspective, the line of sight is from B(10,0,0) to P(x,y,h), and the angle of elevation is 60 degrees. The horizontal distance from Bob to O is sqrt((x - 10)² + y²). So, tan(60°) = h / sqrt((x - 10)² + y²).So, we have two equations:1. tan(30°) = h / sqrt(x² + y²) => h = sqrt(x² + y²) * tan(30°) = sqrt(x² + y²) / √32. tan(60°) = h / sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) => h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * tan(60°) = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3So, setting the two expressions for h equal:sqrt(x² + y²) / √3 = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3Multiply both sides by √3:sqrt(x² + y²) = 3 * sqrt((x - 10)² + y²)Now, square both sides:x² + y² = 9 * [(x - 10)² + y²]Expand the right side:x² + y² = 9*(x² - 20x + 100 + y²)x² + y² = 9x² - 180x + 900 + 9y²Bring all terms to the left side:x² + y² - 9x² + 180x - 900 - 9y² = 0Combine like terms:-8x² -8y² + 180x - 900 = 0Multiply both sides by -1:8x² + 8y² - 180x + 900 = 0Divide both sides by 4 to simplify:2x² + 2y² - 45x + 225 = 0Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can find another relation. Let me recall that from Alice's perspective, h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √3, and from Bob's, h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3. So, maybe I can express h in terms of x and y and then find a relation.Alternatively, let me consider that the point O(x,y,0) is such that the lines AO and BO form angles of 30 and 60 degrees with the vertical. Wait, no, the angles of elevation are with respect to the horizontal.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the ratio of h from Alice and Bob is 1/√3 and √3, so h from Alice is h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √3, and from Bob, h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3. So, setting them equal:sqrt(x² + y²) / √3 = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3Which simplifies to sqrt(x² + y²) = 3 * sqrt((x - 10)² + y²)Squaring both sides:x² + y² = 9*((x - 10)² + y²)Which is the same as before, leading to 8x² + 8y² - 180x + 900 = 0Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of x and y. Let me try to complete the square.First, divide the equation by 8:x² + y² - (180/8)x + 900/8 = 0Simplify:x² + y² - (45/2)x + 112.5 = 0Let me rearrange:x² - (45/2)x + y² = -112.5Now, complete the square for x:Take the coefficient of x, which is -45/2, divide by 2: -45/4, square it: (45/4)² = 2025/16So, add 2025/16 to both sides:x² - (45/2)x + 2025/16 + y² = -112.5 + 2025/16Convert -112.5 to sixteenths: -112.5 = -1800/16So, right side: (-1800/16) + (2025/16) = 225/16So, the equation becomes:(x - 45/4)² + y² = (15/4)²So, this is a circle centered at (45/4, 0) with radius 15/4.Wait, 45/4 is 11.25, and 15/4 is 3.75. So, the circle is centered at (11.25, 0) with radius 3.75.But Alice is at (0,0) and Bob is at (10,0). So, the point O(x,y,0) lies on this circle.But we also have that the distance from Alice to O is sqrt(x² + y²), and from Bob to O is sqrt((x - 10)² + y²). But I'm not sure if this helps directly.Alternatively, since we have the circle equation, maybe we can find x and y.But this seems too involved. Maybe there's a simpler way.Wait, earlier I assumed that the point O is such that x² + y² = 100, but that was incorrect because O is not necessarily on the line AB. So, that approach was wrong.Wait, but in the initial approach, I assumed that the horizontal distances x and y from Alice and Bob to O satisfy x² + y² = 100, but that's only true if O is on the line AB, which it's not. So, that was a mistake.Therefore, my initial answer of approximately 5.5 miles is incorrect because I made a wrong assumption about the position of O.So, I need to find another way.Let me try to use the two equations I derived:1. h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √32. h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3So, setting them equal:sqrt(x² + y²) / √3 = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3Multiply both sides by √3:sqrt(x² + y²) = 3 * sqrt((x - 10)² + y²)Square both sides:x² + y² = 9*((x - 10)² + y²)Expand the right side:x² + y² = 9x² - 180x + 900 + 9y²Bring all terms to the left:x² + y² - 9x² + 180x - 900 - 9y² = 0Combine like terms:-8x² -8y² + 180x - 900 = 0Divide by -4:2x² + 2y² - 45x + 225 = 0Hmm, same as before. Maybe I can solve for y² in terms of x.From the equation:2x² + 2y² - 45x + 225 = 0Divide by 2:x² + y² - (45/2)x + 112.5 = 0So, y² = (45/2)x - x² - 112.5Now, substitute this into one of the expressions for h. Let's use h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √3So, h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √3But from the equation above, x² + y² = (45/2)x - 112.5So, h = sqrt((45/2)x - 112.5) / √3But we also have h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3Let me compute (x - 10)² + y²:(x - 10)² + y² = x² - 20x + 100 + y²But from the equation x² + y² = (45/2)x - 112.5, so:(x - 10)² + y² = (45/2)x - 112.5 - 20x + 100Simplify:= (45/2)x - 20x - 112.5 + 100Convert 20x to halves: 40/2 xSo, (45/2 - 40/2)x = (5/2)x-112.5 + 100 = -12.5So, (x - 10)² + y² = (5/2)x - 12.5Therefore, h = sqrt((5/2)x - 12.5) * √3But we also have h = sqrt((45/2)x - 112.5) / √3So, set them equal:sqrt((45/2)x - 112.5) / √3 = sqrt((5/2)x - 12.5) * √3Multiply both sides by √3:sqrt((45/2)x - 112.5) = 3 * sqrt((5/2)x - 12.5)Square both sides:(45/2)x - 112.5 = 9*((5/2)x - 12.5)Expand the right side:= (45/2)x - 112.5Wait, that's interesting. So, both sides are equal:(45/2)x - 112.5 = (45/2)x - 112.5Which is an identity, meaning that the equations are dependent, and we can't solve for x uniquely. So, this suggests that there are infinitely many solutions along the circle we derived earlier.But that can't be right because the problem should have a unique solution. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.Wait, let me go back. Maybe I should consider that the point O is such that the lines from Alice and Bob to O are perpendicular. Because Alice is looking north and Bob is looking west, their lines of sight are perpendicular, so the triangle AOB is a right triangle with right angle at O.Wait, that makes sense. So, if Alice is at A, Bob at B, and O is the point directly below the airplane, then triangle AOB is a right triangle with right angle at O. Therefore, OA is perpendicular to OB.So, in that case, the distance OA is x, OB is y, and AB is 10 miles. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, x² + y² = 10² = 100.Wait, that's the same as my initial assumption! So, in that case, my initial approach was correct, and the answer is indeed approximately 5.5 miles.Wait, but earlier I thought that O is not necessarily on the line AB, but if the lines of sight are perpendicular, then O must lie such that OA and OB are perpendicular, meaning that O lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait, no, if OA and OB are perpendicular, then O lies on the circle with diameter AB, but in this case, AB is 10 miles, so the circle would have radius 5 miles, centered at (5,0). But in our case, O is such that OA and OB are perpendicular, so O lies on the circle with diameter AB, but in our coordinate system, that would be the circle centered at (5,0) with radius 5.Wait, but in our earlier approach, we had O at (x,y) such that x² + y² = 100, but that's only if O is on the circle with radius 10 centered at the origin, which is not the case. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that OA and OB are perpendicular.Wait, let me clarify. If Alice is looking north and Bob is looking west, their lines of sight are along the y-axis and negative x-axis, respectively. So, the lines OA and OB are along the y-axis and negative x-axis, which are perpendicular. Therefore, the point O must lie at the intersection of these two lines, which is at (0,0). But that would mean that O is at (0,0), which is Alice's position, but then Bob's line of sight would have to go from (10,0,0) to (0,0,h), which is a distance of sqrt(10² + h²), and the angle of elevation would be arctan(h / 10). But in the problem, Bob's angle is 60 degrees, so arctan(h / 10) = 60°, which would give h = 10 tan(60°) = 10√3 ≈ 17.32 miles, which is way higher than the options given.This is a contradiction, so my assumption that OA and OB are perpendicular is incorrect. Therefore, the point O is not at the intersection of Alice's north and Bob's west lines of sight, but somewhere else such that the lines of sight from Alice and Bob to the airplane are at 30° and 60°, respectively, but not necessarily perpendicular.Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect because I assumed that OA and OB are perpendicular, which led to the wrong conclusion. Instead, I need to model this without that assumption.So, let's start over.Let me denote Alice's position as A(0,0,0), Bob's position as B(10,0,0), and the airplane at P(x,y,h). The point directly below the airplane is O(x,y,0).From Alice's perspective, the angle of elevation to P is 30°, so tan(30°) = h / distance from A to O. The distance from A to O is sqrt(x² + y²). So, tan(30°) = h / sqrt(x² + y²) => h = sqrt(x² + y²) * tan(30°) = sqrt(x² + y²) / √3.From Bob's perspective, the angle of elevation to P is 60°, so tan(60°) = h / distance from B to O. The distance from B to O is sqrt((x - 10)² + y²). So, tan(60°) = h / sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) => h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * tan(60°) = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3.So, we have:1. h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √32. h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3Setting them equal:sqrt(x² + y²) / √3 = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3Multiply both sides by √3:sqrt(x² + y²) = 3 * sqrt((x - 10)² + y²)Square both sides:x² + y² = 9*((x - 10)² + y²)Expand the right side:x² + y² = 9x² - 180x + 900 + 9y²Bring all terms to the left:x² + y² - 9x² + 180x - 900 - 9y² = 0Combine like terms:-8x² -8y² + 180x - 900 = 0Divide by -4:2x² + 2y² - 45x + 225 = 0Divide by 2:x² + y² - (45/2)x + 112.5 = 0This is the equation of a circle. Let me write it in standard form by completing the square.Group x terms and y terms:x² - (45/2)x + y² = -112.5Complete the square for x:Take the coefficient of x, which is -45/2, divide by 2: -45/4, square it: (45/4)² = 2025/16Add this to both sides:x² - (45/2)x + 2025/16 + y² = -112.5 + 2025/16Convert -112.5 to sixteenths: -112.5 = -1800/16So, right side: (-1800/16) + (2025/16) = 225/16So, the equation becomes:(x - 45/4)² + y² = (15/4)²So, this is a circle centered at (45/4, 0) with radius 15/4, which is (11.25, 0) with radius 3.75.Now, we need to find the point O(x,y,0) on this circle such that the angles of elevation from Alice and Bob are 30° and 60°, respectively.But this seems complicated. Maybe I can parameterize the circle and find the corresponding h.Let me denote the center of the circle as C(11.25, 0) and radius r = 3.75.So, any point O on the circle can be written as:x = 11.25 + 3.75 cosθy = 0 + 3.75 sinθWhere θ is the parameter varying from 0 to 2π.Now, from Alice's perspective, h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √3From Bob's perspective, h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3So, equate them:sqrt(x² + y²) / √3 = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3Which simplifies to sqrt(x² + y²) = 3 sqrt((x - 10)² + y²)But since we have x and y in terms of θ, maybe we can substitute and solve for θ.Let me compute x² + y²:x = 11.25 + 3.75 cosθy = 3.75 sinθSo, x² + y² = (11.25 + 3.75 cosθ)² + (3.75 sinθ)²Expand:= 11.25² + 2*11.25*3.75 cosθ + (3.75 cosθ)² + (3.75 sinθ)²= 126.5625 + 84.375 cosθ + 14.0625 (cos²θ + sin²θ)Since cos²θ + sin²θ = 1:= 126.5625 + 84.375 cosθ + 14.0625= 140.625 + 84.375 cosθSimilarly, (x - 10)² + y²:x - 10 = 11.25 + 3.75 cosθ - 10 = 1.25 + 3.75 cosθSo, (x - 10)² + y² = (1.25 + 3.75 cosθ)² + (3.75 sinθ)²Expand:= 1.25² + 2*1.25*3.75 cosθ + (3.75 cosθ)² + (3.75 sinθ)²= 1.5625 + 9.375 cosθ + 14.0625 (cos²θ + sin²θ)= 1.5625 + 9.375 cosθ + 14.0625= 15.625 + 9.375 cosθNow, from the equation sqrt(x² + y²) = 3 sqrt((x - 10)² + y²), we have:sqrt(140.625 + 84.375 cosθ) = 3 sqrt(15.625 + 9.375 cosθ)Square both sides:140.625 + 84.375 cosθ = 9*(15.625 + 9.375 cosθ)Compute the right side:= 140.625 + 84.375 cosθWait, that's the same as the left side. So, 140.625 + 84.375 cosθ = 140.625 + 84.375 cosθWhich is an identity, meaning that for any θ, this equation holds. Therefore, any point O on the circle satisfies the condition, which suggests that there are infinitely many solutions, which contradicts the problem's implication that there's a unique answer.This must mean that my approach is flawed, or perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the altitude is uniquely determined despite the multiple possible positions of O.Wait, but the problem says that Alice and Bob live 10 miles apart, and they see the same airplane at the same time with those angles. So, perhaps the airplane's altitude is uniquely determined regardless of where O is.Wait, but from the equations, h is expressed in terms of x and y, but since x and y are related through the circle equation, maybe h can be expressed in terms of the circle's properties.Wait, from the circle equation, we have:(x - 45/4)² + y² = (15/4)²Which is:x² - (45/2)x + (45/4)² + y² = (15/4)²But from earlier, we have:x² + y² = (45/2)x - 112.5So, substituting into h:h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √3 = sqrt((45/2)x - 112.5) / √3But we also have h = sqrt((x - 10)² + y²) * √3 = sqrt((5/2)x - 12.5) * √3So, perhaps I can find h in terms of the circle's properties.Wait, let me consider that the point O lies on the circle centered at (11.25, 0) with radius 3.75. The maximum possible value of x on this circle is 11.25 + 3.75 = 15, and the minimum is 11.25 - 3.75 = 7.5. So, x ranges from 7.5 to 15.Similarly, y ranges from -3.75 to 3.75.Now, h is given by h = sqrt(x² + y²) / √3, and since x² + y² = (45/2)x - 112.5, h = sqrt((45/2)x - 112.5) / √3So, h is a function of x, and since x ranges from 7.5 to 15, let's compute h at these extremes.At x = 7.5:h = sqrt((45/2)*7.5 - 112.5) / √3= sqrt(168.75 - 112.5) / √3= sqrt(56.25) / √3= 7.5 / 1.732 ≈ 4.330 milesAt x = 15:h = sqrt((45/2)*15 - 112.5) / √3= sqrt(337.5 - 112.5) / √3= sqrt(225) / √3= 15 / 1.732 ≈ 8.660 milesSo, h ranges from approximately 4.330 to 8.660 miles as O moves around the circle.But the problem asks for the closest altitude, so perhaps the answer is around 5.5 miles, but my initial approach gave 5.477, which is close to 5.5, but considering the range, maybe 5.5 is the correct answer.Wait, but the options are 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5. So, 5.5 is an option, but 4.330 is also within the range, but 4.330 is closer to 4.5 than to 4, but the problem states that both Alice and Bob see the same airplane at the same time, so perhaps the altitude is uniquely determined.Wait, but from the equations, h can vary depending on the position of O on the circle, so perhaps the problem is designed such that the altitude is uniquely determined, which would mean that my initial approach was correct, and the answer is approximately 5.5 miles.But I'm confused because when I considered O on the line AB, I got h ≈ 5.5, but when I considered O not on AB, h can vary between 4.33 and 8.66.Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that O lies on the line AB, making the initial approach correct. So, in that case, the answer is approximately 5.5 miles.But given the options, 5.5 is an option, so I think that's the intended answer.Therefore, the closest answer is E) 5.5."},{"question":"After moving the point representing -2 on the number line 3 units to the right, the corresponding number of the resulting point is ______.","answer":"First, I identify the original point on the number line, which is (-2).Next, I determine the direction and distance to move.

The least common denominator is 36.Converting each fraction:- (- frac{3}{4} = - frac{27}{36})- (- frac{5}{9} = - frac{20}{36})- (frac{7}{12} = frac{21}{36})Adding these together: (-27 - 20 + 21 = -26), so the numerator simplifies to (- frac{26}{36}).Next, I'll divide this result by (- frac{1}{36}).

What is the area of this triangle?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of a triangle with vertices A at (3, 0), B at (0, 3), and C somewhere on the line x + y = 7. Hmm, interesting. I remember that the area of a triangle can be found using the coordinates of its vertices. Let me recall the formula for that.I think it's something like the determinant formula, right? Yeah, the formula is:Area = (1/2) | (x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)) |Let me write that down properly. So, substituting the points A, B, and C into this formula should give me the area. But wait, point C is on the line x + y = 7, so its coordinates are (x, 7 - x) for some x. That means I can represent point C as (x, 7 - x). So, plugging in the coordinates into the area formula, let's see:First, let me note the coordinates:A = (3, 0) => x_A = 3, y_A = 0B = (0, 3) => x_B = 0, y_B = 3C = (x, 7 - x) => x_C = x, y_C = 7 - xNow, plugging these into the area formula:Area = (1/2) | 3*(3 - (7 - x)) + 0*((7 - x) - 0) + x*(0 - 3) |Let me simplify each term step by step.First term: 3*(3 - (7 - x)) = 3*(3 - 7 + x) = 3*(-4 + x) = -12 + 3xSecond term: 0*((7 - x) - 0) = 0*(7 - x) = 0Third term: x*(0 - 3) = x*(-3) = -3xSo, putting it all together:Area = (1/2) | (-12 + 3x) + 0 + (-3x) | = (1/2) | -12 + 3x - 3x | = (1/2) | -12 | = (1/2)*12 = 6Wait, that's interesting. The x terms canceled out, so the area is 6 regardless of the value of x. So, no matter where point C is on the line x + y = 7, the area of triangle ABC is always 6.But let me verify that because sometimes when I do algebra quickly, I might make a mistake.Let me recast the problem another way. Maybe using vectors or base and height.Alternatively, I can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by coordinates:Area = (1/2)| (x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)) |Which is the same as what I did before, so I think that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can plot the points or think about the geometry.Point A is at (3, 0), which is on the x-axis, 3 units to the right. Point B is at (0, 3), which is on the y-axis, 3 units up. Point C is somewhere on the line x + y = 7, which is a straight line. Let me sketch this mentally.The line x + y = 7 is a straight line that intersects the x-axis at (7, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 7). So, it's a line that's above and to the right of points A and B.So, triangle ABC has vertices at (3, 0), (0, 3), and somewhere on x + y = 7.Wait, another way to find the area is to calculate the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors AB and AC, then take half of that.Let me try that approach.First, vector AB is from A to B: (0 - 3, 3 - 0) = (-3, 3)Vector AC is from A to C: (x - 3, (7 - x) - 0) = (x - 3, 7 - x)The area of the parallelogram is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:| (-3)(7 - x) - (3)(x - 3) | = | -21 + 3x - 3x + 9 | = | -12 | = 12So, the area of the parallelogram is 12, hence the area of the triangle is half that, which is 6.So, that confirms my earlier result.Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates, which is also given by 1/2 | (x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)) |, which is the same as before.So, seems like regardless of where C is on the line x + y = 7, the area is always 6. That's kind of surprising, but the math checks out.Wait, let me think about why that is. Maybe because the line x + y = 7 is parallel to the line AB? Let me check.The line AB goes from (3, 0) to (0, 3). The slope of AB is (3 - 0)/(0 - 3) = -1. The line x + y = 7 also has a slope of -1, so they are indeed parallel.So, if AB is the base of the triangle, and since C is moving along a line parallel to AB, the height of the triangle remains constant. Therefore, the area remains constant regardless of where C is on that line.That makes sense. So, the height is the perpendicular distance from line AB to line x + y = 7.Let me compute that distance to confirm.The formula for the distance between two parallel lines Ax + By + C1 = 0 and Ax + By + C2 = 0 is |C1 - C2| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2).First, let me write the equations of the lines AB and x + y = 7.Line AB: passes through (3, 0) and (0, 3). As we saw, the slope is -1, so the equation is y = -x + 3, or x + y = 3.So, line AB is x + y = 3, and line C is on x + y = 7.So, both lines are x + y = 3 and x + y = 7, which are parallel.So, the distance between them is |7 - 3| / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = 4 / sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(2).So, the height of the triangle is 2*sqrt(2).Now, the base of the triangle is the length of AB.Let me compute the length of AB.Points A(3, 0) and B(0, 3). The distance between them is sqrt[(0 - 3)^2 + (3 - 0)^2] = sqrt[9 + 9] = sqrt[18] = 3*sqrt(2).So, base AB is 3*sqrt(2), height is 2*sqrt(2). Therefore, area is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*(3*sqrt(2))*(2*sqrt(2)).Let me compute that:(1/2)*(3*sqrt(2))*(2*sqrt(2)) = (1/2)*(3*2)*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = (1/2)*6*2 = (1/2)*12 = 6.So, that's another way to get the area as 6. So, that's consistent with my previous calculations.Therefore, regardless of where point C is on the line x + y = 7, the area remains 6.I think that's solid. So, the area is 6.**Final Answer**The area of the triangle is boxed{6}."},{"question":"Find [left|left(frac 35+frac 45iright)^6right|]","answer":"First, I need to find the modulus of the complex number ( frac{3}{5} + frac{4}{5}i ).The modulus of a complex number ( a + bi ) is calculated as ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ).So, for ( frac{3}{5} + frac{4}{5}i ), the modulus is:[sqrt{left(frac{3}{5}right)^2 + left(frac{4}{5}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{9}{25} + frac{16}{25}} = sqrt{frac{25}{25}} = 1]Next, I use the property that the modulus of a complex number raised to a power is the modulus raised to that power.Therefore, the modulus of ( left(frac{3}{5} + frac{4}{5}iright)^6 ) is:[1^6 = 1]"},{"question":"In the following equations, the letters (a, b,) and (c) represent different numbers.begin{aligned}& 1^{3}=1 & a^{3}=1+7 & 3^{3}=1+7+b & 4^{3}=1+7+cend{aligned}The numerical value of (a + b + c) is:(A) 58(B) 110(C) 75(D) 77(E) 79","answer":"First, I'll solve for ( a ) using the equation ( a^3 = 1 + 7 ).

Let me write it down to make sure I understand it correctly.f(x) is equal to log base 10 of x when x is greater than 0. And when x is less than or equal to 0, f(x) is equal to x plus the integral from 0 to a of 3t squared dt. Okay, so f(x) has two cases depending on whether x is positive or not.The problem says that f(f(1)) equals 1, and we need to find the value of a. Hmm, okay. So I need to compute f(f(1)) and set it equal to 1, then solve for a.Let me break this down step by step.First, let's compute f(1). Since 1 is greater than 0, we use the first case of the function, which is log base 10 of x. So f(1) = lg(1). Wait, log base 10 of 1 is 0, right? Because 10^0 = 1. So f(1) = 0.Now, I need to compute f(f(1)) which is f(0). Because f(1) is 0, so f(f(1)) = f(0). Now, let's compute f(0). Since 0 is less than or equal to 0, we use the second case of the function. So f(0) = 0 + the integral from 0 to a of 3t squared dt.Let me compute that integral. The integral of 3t squared dt is straightforward. The integral of t squared is (t^3)/3, so multiplying by 3 gives t^3. So the integral from 0 to a of 3t^2 dt is [t^3] from 0 to a, which is a^3 - 0^3 = a^3.Therefore, f(0) is 0 + a^3, which is just a^3. So f(f(1)) = a^3.But the problem states that f(f(1)) = 1. So we have a^3 = 1. To solve for a, we take the cube root of both sides. The cube root of 1 is 1, so a = 1.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. Compute f(1): Since 1 > 0, f(1) = lg(1) = 0. That seems correct.2. Compute f(0): Since 0 ≤ 0, f(0) = 0 + ∫₀^a 3t² dt. The integral of 3t² is indeed t³, so evaluating from 0 to a gives a³ - 0 = a³. So f(0) = a³.3. Then f(f(1)) = f(0) = a³. The problem says this equals 1, so a³ = 1, which means a = 1. That seems straightforward.Is there any chance I made a mistake in computing the integral? Let me verify.The integral of 3t² dt is 3*(t³/3) = t³. So yes, that's correct. Evaluated from 0 to a, it's a³ - 0 = a³. So that's right.Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the function definitions? Let me check.f(x) is lg x for x > 0. So f(1) is definitely lg(1) = 0. Then f(0) is 0 + integral, which is a³. So f(f(1)) is a³, set to 1, so a is 1. Hmm, seems solid.Wait, but just to be thorough, is there another possible value for a? Since a³ = 1, in real numbers, the only real solution is a = 1. The other cube roots are complex, but since we're dealing with real numbers here, a must be 1.So yeah, I think a is 1.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given unit vectors overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{c} satisfying overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}+2overrightarrow{c}=overrightarrow{0}, find overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given three unit vectors a, b, and c. They satisfy the equation a + b + 2c = 0. I need to find the dot product of a and b, which is written as a · b. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with vectors and their dot products, sometimes squaring both sides of an equation can be helpful. That way, I can use the properties of dot products to simplify things. So, maybe I can square both sides of the given equation.The equation is a + b + 2c = 0. If I square both sides, I get (a + b + 2c) · (a + b + 2c) = 0 · 0, which simplifies to 0. So, let me write that out:(a + b + 2c) · (a + b + 2c) = 0.Now, I can expand this dot product. Remembering that the dot product is distributive, so I can expand it term by term:a · a + a · b + a · 2c + b · a + b · b + b · 2c + 2c · a + 2c · b + 2c · 2c = 0.Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can group similar terms together. Let's see:First, the terms where a is dotted with itself: a · a. Since a is a unit vector, a · a = |a|² = 1.Similarly, b · b = 1, and c · c = 1 because they are all unit vectors.Now, the cross terms: a · b, a · c, b · a, b · c, c · a, c · b, and 2c · 2c.Wait, hold on. Let me correct that. The expansion should be:(a + b + 2c) · (a + b + 2c) = a·a + a·b + a·2c + b·a + b·b + b·2c + 2c·a + 2c·b + 2c·2c.But actually, when you distribute the dot product, each term in the first vector is dotted with each term in the second vector. So, more accurately, it's:a·a + a·b + a·2c + b·a + b·b + b·2c + 2c·a + 2c·b + (2c)·(2c).So, let's compute each term:1. a·a = |a|² = 12. a·b = a·b (this is what we're trying to find)3. a·2c = 2(a·c)4. b·a = a·b (dot product is commutative)5. b·b = |b|² = 16. b·2c = 2(b·c)7. 2c·a = 2(c·a) = 2(a·c)8. 2c·b = 2(c·b) = 2(b·c)9. (2c)·(2c) = 4(c·c) = 4|c|² = 4*1 = 4Now, let's add all these terms together:1 + (a·b) + 2(a·c) + (a·b) + 1 + 2(b·c) + 2(a·c) + 2(b·c) + 4 = 0.Now, let's combine like terms:- The constants: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6- The a·b terms: (a·b) + (a·b) = 2(a·b)- The a·c terms: 2(a·c) + 2(a·c) = 4(a·c)- The b·c terms: 2(b·c) + 2(b·c) = 4(b·c)So, putting it all together:6 + 2(a·b) + 4(a·c) + 4(b·c) = 0.Hmm, so now I have an equation with a·b, a·c, and b·c. But I don't know any of these dot products yet. I need another equation or a way to relate these terms.Wait, maybe I can find expressions for a·c and b·c. Let me think. Since a + b + 2c = 0, I can solve for one of the vectors in terms of the others. Let's solve for c:2c = -a - bc = (-a - b)/2So, c is expressed in terms of a and b. Maybe I can use this to find a·c and b·c.Let's compute a·c:a·c = a·[(-a - b)/2] = (-a·a - a·b)/2 = (-|a|² - a·b)/2 = (-1 - a·b)/2.Similarly, compute b·c:b·c = b·[(-a - b)/2] = (-b·a - b·b)/2 = (-a·b - |b|²)/2 = (-a·b - 1)/2.So, both a·c and b·c are expressed in terms of a·b. Let's denote a·b as x for simplicity. So, x = a·b.Then, a·c = (-1 - x)/2 and b·c = (-1 - x)/2 as well.So, substituting back into our earlier equation:6 + 2x + 4(a·c) + 4(b·c) = 0.Replace a·c and b·c with (-1 - x)/2:6 + 2x + 4*(-1 - x)/2 + 4*(-1 - x)/2 = 0.Simplify each term:First, 4*(-1 - x)/2 simplifies to 2*(-1 - x) = -2 - 2x.So, the equation becomes:6 + 2x + (-2 - 2x) + (-2 - 2x) = 0.Wait, let's compute that step by step:6 + 2x + [4*(-1 - x)/2] + [4*(-1 - x)/2] = 0Which is:6 + 2x + 2*(-1 - x) + 2*(-1 - x) = 0Compute each term:6 + 2x - 2 - 2x - 2 - 2x = 0Combine like terms:Constants: 6 - 2 - 2 = 2x terms: 2x - 2x - 2x = -2xSo, the equation simplifies to:2 - 2x = 0Solving for x:-2x = -2Divide both sides by -2:x = 1So, x = a·b = 1.Wait, but hold on. If a and b are unit vectors, their dot product is equal to the cosine of the angle between them. So, a·b = cosθ, where θ is the angle between a and b. If a·b = 1, that would mean cosθ = 1, so θ = 0 degrees. That would mean vectors a and b are in the same direction. But if a and b are in the same direction, then a + b would be 2a (since they are unit vectors), and then 2c would have to be -2a, so c = -a. But c is also a unit vector, so that's possible. Let me check if this makes sense.If a = b, then a + b = 2a, so 2c = -2a, which gives c = -a. So, c is just the negative of a. Then, let's check if all vectors are unit vectors:|a| = 1, |b| = 1, |c| = |-a| = |a| = 1. So, yes, they are unit vectors.But wait, let's verify the original equation:a + b + 2c = a + a + 2*(-a) = 2a - 2a = 0. So, that works.But wait, is this the only solution? Because in 3D space, vectors can have different configurations. But in this case, since all three vectors are related through the equation a + b + 2c = 0, and we've found that a·b = 1, which implies they are colinear. So, in this specific case, the only solution is that a and b are the same vector, and c is their negative.But wait, is that the only possibility? Let me think. Suppose a and b are not the same vector, but their dot product is 1. That would require that they are in exactly the same direction, so they must be scalar multiples of each other. Since they are unit vectors, the only scalar multiple possible is 1, so they must be equal. So, yes, a and b must be equal.Therefore, the only solution is a = b, c = -a, and a·b = 1.But wait, I feel like this might be too straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.Starting from the equation:6 + 2x + 4(a·c) + 4(b·c) = 0.Then, I expressed a·c and b·c in terms of x, which is a·b.a·c = (-1 - x)/2b·c = (-1 - x)/2Substituting back:6 + 2x + 4*(-1 - x)/2 + 4*(-1 - x)/2 = 0Simplify 4*(something)/2: that's 2*(something). So:6 + 2x + 2*(-1 - x) + 2*(-1 - x) = 0Which is:6 + 2x - 2 - 2x - 2 - 2x = 0Combine constants: 6 - 2 - 2 = 2Combine x terms: 2x - 2x - 2x = -2xSo, 2 - 2x = 0 => x = 1.Yes, that seems correct. So, a·b = 1.But wait, another way to think about this is geometrically. If a + b + 2c = 0, then a + b = -2c. Since c is a unit vector, -2c is a vector of length 2 in the opposite direction of c.But a and b are unit vectors, so their sum a + b has a magnitude between 0 and 2. Specifically, |a + b| = sqrt(|a|² + |b|² + 2a·b) = sqrt(1 + 1 + 2x) = sqrt(2 + 2x).But we know that a + b = -2c, so |a + b| = |-2c| = 2|c| = 2*1 = 2.Therefore, sqrt(2 + 2x) = 2.Squaring both sides: 2 + 2x = 4 => 2x = 2 => x = 1.So, this is another way to get a·b = 1.Therefore, both algebraically and geometrically, we get that a·b = 1.So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The dot product of vectors a and b is boxed{1}."},{"question":"For the set {x mid a leq x leq b}, we define b-a as its length. Let sets A={x mid a leq x leq a+1981} and B={x mid b-1014 leq x leq b}, where A and B are subsets of U={x mid 0 leq x leq 2012}. Find the minimum length of the set A cap B.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about sets A and B, which are subsets of U, where U is the set of all x such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 2012. The goal is to find the minimum length of the intersection of A and B, which is A ∩ B. First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. Set A is defined as {x | a ≤ x ≤ a + 1981}, so it's a closed interval starting at a and ending at a + 1981. Similarly, set B is {x | b - 1014 ≤ x ≤ b}, so it's another closed interval starting at b - 1014 and ending at b. Both A and B are subsets of U, which is the interval from 0 to 2012. The length of a set is defined as the difference between its upper and lower bounds, so the length of A is 1981, and the length of B is 1014. We need to find the minimum possible length of their intersection, A ∩ B. Okay, so to find the minimum length of the intersection, I think we need to consider how these two intervals can overlap as little as possible while still being subsets of U. Let me visualize this. Imagine the universal set U is a line segment from 0 to 2012. Set A is a segment of length 1981, and set B is a segment of length 1014. We can slide these two segments along the universal set U, and we want to find the position where their overlap is the smallest possible. But both A and B must be entirely within U. So, the starting point of A, which is a, must satisfy a ≥ 0, and the ending point of A, which is a + 1981, must be ≤ 2012. Similarly, for B, the starting point is b - 1014, which must be ≥ 0, and the ending point is b, which must be ≤ 2012. So, let's write down the constraints:For set A:- a ≥ 0- a + 1981 ≤ 2012 ⇒ a ≤ 2012 - 1981 = 31So, a can range from 0 to 31.For set B:- b - 1014 ≥ 0 ⇒ b ≥ 1014- b ≤ 2012So, b can range from 1014 to 2012.Now, the intersection of A and B, A ∩ B, is the set of all x such that x is in both A and B. The length of this intersection will depend on how much A and B overlap. To find the minimum length of A ∩ B, we need to position A and B such that their overlap is minimized. Let me recall that the length of the intersection of two intervals can be calculated if we know their positions. If two intervals [a1, a2] and [b1, b2] overlap, then the intersection is [max(a1, b1), min(a2, b2)], and the length is min(a2, b2) - max(a1, b1). If this value is negative, it means the intervals don't overlap, and the intersection is empty, with length 0. But in our case, since both A and B are subsets of U, and U is from 0 to 2012, we have to make sure that A and B are placed in such a way that their intersection is as small as possible but still non-negative. Wait, but is it possible for A and B to not overlap at all? Let's check.If A is placed as far to the left as possible, with a = 0, then A is [0, 1981]. If B is placed as far to the right as possible, with b = 2012, then B is [2012 - 1014, 2012] = [998, 2012]. So, A is [0, 1981], and B is [998, 2012]. Their intersection would be [998, 1981], which has a length of 1981 - 998 = 983. Alternatively, if we place A as far to the right as possible, a = 31, so A is [31, 31 + 1981] = [31, 2012]. Then, if we place B as far to the left as possible, b = 1014, so B is [1014 - 1014, 1014] = [0, 1014]. So, A is [31, 2012], and B is [0, 1014]. Their intersection is [31, 1014], which has a length of 1014 - 31 = 983. Hmm, so in both cases, the intersection length is 983. Is this the minimum? Or can we get a smaller intersection?Wait, maybe I can adjust a and b such that the overlap is even smaller. Let me think.Suppose we move A a bit to the right and B a bit to the left, so that their overlap is minimized. Let's denote the starting point of A as a, so A is [a, a + 1981], and the starting point of B is b - 1014, so B is [b - 1014, b]. We want to minimize the overlap between [a, a + 1981] and [b - 1014, b]. The overlap occurs when a ≤ b and a + 1981 ≥ b - 1014. Wait, actually, for two intervals [a1, a2] and [b1, b2], the overlap is non-empty if a1 ≤ b2 and b1 ≤ a2. So, in our case, the overlap is non-empty if a ≤ b and b - 1014 ≤ a + 1981. Which simplifies to:a ≤ b and b ≤ a + 1981 + 1014.Wait, no, let me write it correctly.The overlap condition is:a ≤ b and b - 1014 ≤ a + 1981.So, the first inequality is a ≤ b, and the second is b ≤ a + 1981 + 1014? Wait, no.Wait, the second inequality is b - 1014 ≤ a + 1981, so b ≤ a + 1981 + 1014. But 1981 + 1014 is 3000 - 5? Wait, 1981 + 1014: 1981 + 1000 is 2981, plus 14 is 2995. So, b ≤ a + 2995.But since b is at most 2012, and a is at most 31, a + 2995 would be 31 + 2995 = 3026, which is way beyond 2012. So, the second inequality is automatically satisfied because b is at most 2012, which is less than a + 2995.Therefore, the only condition we need is a ≤ b for the overlap to be non-empty. But wait, actually, if a > b, then A starts after B ends, so their intersection is empty. Similarly, if b - 1014 > a + 1981, then B starts after A ends, so their intersection is empty. Therefore, the overlap is non-empty if and only if a ≤ b and b - 1014 ≤ a + 1981, which simplifies to a ≤ b ≤ a + 1981 + 1014. But since b is at most 2012, and a is at most 31, the upper bound is not restrictive. So, the overlap is non-empty if a ≤ b. Wait, but if a > b, then A starts after B ends, so no overlap. If a ≤ b, then the overlap is at least something. But in our problem, we can choose a and b such that a ≤ b, but we can also choose a and b such that a > b, making the overlap empty, but wait, is that possible?Wait, no, because A is [a, a + 1981], and B is [b - 1014, b]. So, if a > b, then A starts after B ends, so their intersection is empty. Similarly, if b - 1014 > a + 1981, then B starts after A ends, so their intersection is empty. Therefore, the intersection is empty if either a > b or b - 1014 > a + 1981. But in our case, since a can be as large as 31, and b can be as small as 1014, let's see if a > b is possible. Wait, a is at most 31, and b is at least 1014. So, a can never be greater than b because 31 < 1014. Therefore, a ≤ b always holds. Therefore, the overlap is always non-empty because a ≤ b, and the other condition is automatically satisfied because b - 1014 is at least 0, and a + 1981 is at most 31 + 1981 = 2012, which is equal to the upper bound of U. Wait, so if a is 31, then a + 1981 is 2012, which is the end of U. Similarly, if b is 1014, then b - 1014 is 0, which is the start of U. So, in this case, A is [31, 2012], and B is [0, 1014]. Their intersection is [31, 1014], which has length 1014 - 31 = 983. Similarly, when a is 0, A is [0, 1981], and B is [998, 2012], so their intersection is [998, 1981], which is also 983. Wait, so in both cases, the intersection is 983. Is there a way to make the intersection smaller? Let's think.Suppose we move A a bit to the right and B a bit to the left, but within their constraints. Wait, a can be from 0 to 31, and b can be from 1014 to 2012. So, if we set a to some value between 0 and 31, and b to some value between 1014 and 2012, how does the intersection change?Let me denote the intersection as [max(a, b - 1014), min(a + 1981, b)]. So, the length is min(a + 1981, b) - max(a, b - 1014). We need to minimize this expression. Let me denote L = min(a + 1981, b) - max(a, b - 1014). We need to find the minimum L over a ∈ [0,31] and b ∈ [1014,2012].Let me consider different cases.Case 1: a + 1981 ≤ bIn this case, min(a + 1981, b) = a + 1981, and max(a, b - 1014) = a if a ≥ b - 1014, otherwise b - 1014.Wait, so if a + 1981 ≤ b, then since a ≤ b (because a ≤ 31 and b ≥ 1014), and a + 1981 ≤ b, so a + 1981 ≤ b. But a + 1981 ≤ b implies that b ≥ a + 1981. But since a ≤ 31, the minimum b in this case would be 31 + 1981 = 2012. But b can be at most 2012, so in this case, b must be exactly 2012. So, if b = 2012, then a + 1981 ≤ 2012 ⇒ a ≤ 31, which is already satisfied. So, in this case, a can be from 0 to 31, and b is 2012. Then, the intersection is [max(a, 2012 - 1014), 2012]. 2012 - 1014 is 998, so the intersection is [max(a, 998), 2012]. But since a can be at most 31, which is less than 998, so max(a, 998) is 998. Therefore, the intersection is [998, 2012], which has length 2012 - 998 = 1014. Wait, but earlier, when a was 0 and b was 2012, the intersection was [998, 1981], which was 983. Hmm, so in this case, if a + 1981 ≤ b, which only happens when b = 2012 and a ≤ 31, the intersection is [998, 2012], which is length 1014. But when a = 0 and b = 2012, the intersection is [998, 1981], which is shorter. Wait, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine.Wait, if a + 1981 ≤ b, then the intersection is [max(a, b - 1014), a + 1981]. Wait, no, actually, if a + 1981 ≤ b, then the intersection is [max(a, b - 1014), a + 1981]. But since a + 1981 ≤ b, and b - 1014 ≤ a + 1981 (since b ≤ a + 1981 + 1014, but in this case, b = a + 1981). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.Let me consider the positions of A and B.Set A is a long interval of length 1981, starting at a, ending at a + 1981. Set B is a shorter interval of length 1014, starting at b - 1014, ending at b. We need to place A and B such that their overlap is minimized. Since A is longer, perhaps the minimal overlap occurs when B is as far to the right as possible while A is as far to the left as possible, or vice versa.Wait, but earlier, when I placed A as far left as possible (a = 0) and B as far right as possible (b = 2012), their intersection was [998, 1981], which is 983. Similarly, when A is as far right as possible (a = 31) and B as far left as possible (b = 1014), their intersection is [31, 1014], which is 983 as well. So, in both cases, the intersection is 983. Is it possible to get a smaller intersection? Let's see.Suppose I set a somewhere in the middle, say a = 15, then A is [15, 1996]. If I set b somewhere in the middle, say b = 1523, then B is [1523 - 1014, 1523] = [509, 1523]. Then, the intersection is [max(15, 509), min(1996, 1523)] = [509, 1523], which has a length of 1523 - 509 = 1014. Wait, that's the same as the length of B. So, that's not helpful.Alternatively, if I set a = 15, and b = 1014, then B is [0, 1014], and A is [15, 1996]. The intersection is [15, 1014], which is 1014 - 15 = 999. That's longer than 983.Alternatively, if I set a = 0, and b = 1014, then B is [0, 1014], and A is [0, 1981]. The intersection is [0, 1014], which is 1014. So, that's longer.Alternatively, if I set a = 31, and b = 2012, then A is [31, 2012], and B is [998, 2012]. The intersection is [998, 2012], which is 1014. Wait, but earlier, when a = 31 and b = 1014, the intersection was [31, 1014], which is 983.So, perhaps the minimal intersection occurs when A is as far right as possible and B is as far left as possible, or vice versa.Wait, let's formalize this.The intersection length is L = min(a + 1981, b) - max(a, b - 1014).We need to minimize L over a ∈ [0,31] and b ∈ [1014,2012].Let me consider two cases:Case 1: a + 1981 ≤ b.In this case, min(a + 1981, b) = a + 1981, and max(a, b - 1014) = max(a, b - 1014). But since a + 1981 ≤ b, then b - 1014 ≥ a + 1981 - 1014 = a + 967.But since a ≤ 31, a + 967 ≤ 31 + 967 = 998.But b - 1014 is at least 0, but in this case, since b ≥ a + 1981, and a ≥ 0, b - 1014 ≥ a + 1981 - 1014 = a + 967.But a + 967 is at least 967, so max(a, b - 1014) = b - 1014.Therefore, L = (a + 1981) - (b - 1014) = a + 1981 - b + 1014 = a - b + 3000 - 1981? Wait, no, 1981 + 1014 is 2995, so L = a + 1981 - (b - 1014) = a + 1981 - b + 1014 = a - b + 2995.But since a + 1981 ≤ b, then b ≥ a + 1981, so a - b ≤ -1981. Therefore, L = a - b + 2995 ≤ -1981 + 2995 = 1014.But since L must be non-negative, the minimal L in this case is 0? Wait, no, because a + 1981 ≤ b, but a ≤ 31, so b ≥ a + 1981 ≥ 0 + 1981 = 1981. But b can be as large as 2012. Wait, if b = a + 1981, then L = a + 1981 - (b - 1014) = a + 1981 - (a + 1981 - 1014) = a + 1981 - a - 1981 + 1014 = 1014. So, in this case, L is 1014.But earlier, when a = 0 and b = 2012, L was 983. So, perhaps this case doesn't give us the minimal L.Case 2: a + 1981 > b.In this case, min(a + 1981, b) = b, and max(a, b - 1014) = max(a, b - 1014).So, L = b - max(a, b - 1014).Now, max(a, b - 1014) is equal to a if a ≥ b - 1014, otherwise b - 1014.So, L = b - a if a ≥ b - 1014, otherwise L = b - (b - 1014) = 1014.Therefore, in this case, L is either 1014 or b - a, whichever is smaller.But since we want to minimize L, we need to consider when L = b - a is as small as possible.But since a ≤ 31 and b ≥ 1014, the minimal value of b - a is 1014 - 31 = 983.Therefore, in this case, the minimal L is 983.So, putting it all together, the minimal length of A ∩ B is 983.Therefore, the answer is 983.But let me double-check to make sure.If a = 31 and b = 1014, then A is [31, 2012], and B is [0, 1014]. Their intersection is [31, 1014], which is 1014 - 31 = 983.Similarly, if a = 0 and b = 2012, then A is [0, 1981], and B is [998, 2012]. Their intersection is [998, 1981], which is 1981 - 998 = 983.So, in both cases, the intersection is 983. Is it possible to get a smaller intersection? Let's see.Suppose a is somewhere between 0 and 31, say a = 15, and b is somewhere between 1014 and 2012, say b = 1014 + 15 = 1029.Then, A is [15, 1996], and B is [1029 - 1014, 1029] = [15, 1029]. Their intersection is [15, 1029], which is 1029 - 15 = 1014. So, that's longer.Alternatively, if I set a = 31 and b = 1014 + 31 = 1045, then B is [1045 - 1014, 1045] = [31, 1045]. A is [31, 2012], so their intersection is [31, 1045], which is 1045 - 31 = 1014. Still longer.Alternatively, if I set a = 15 and b = 1014 + 15 = 1029, as before, intersection is 1014.Wait, so maybe 983 is indeed the minimal.Alternatively, if I set a = 0 and b = 1014 + 31 = 1045, then B is [1045 - 1014, 1045] = [31, 1045]. A is [0, 1981], so intersection is [31, 1045], which is 1014.Still longer.Alternatively, if I set a = 31 and b = 1014, which gives intersection [31, 1014], length 983.Alternatively, if I set a = 0 and b = 2012, intersection [998, 1981], length 983.So, in both these extreme cases, the intersection is 983, and in other cases, it's longer.Therefore, 983 is the minimal possible length.So, the answer is 983.**Final Answer**The minimum length of the set (A cap B) is (boxed{983})."},{"question":"Program:  M=1  M=M+1  M=M+2  PRINT M  END  What is the final output value of M?","answer":"First, I'll start with the initial value of M, which is 1.Next, I'll add 1 to M, resulting in M = 2.Then, I'll add 2 to M, which gives M = 4.Finally, the program will print the value of M, which is 4."},{"question":"Given the set (A = left{ x mid x = a_0 + a_1 times 8 + a_2 times 8^2 + a_3 times 8^3 right}), where (a_i in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, i = 0,1,2,3) and (a_3 neq 0). If positive integers (m, n in A) satisfy (m + n = 2018) and (m > n), find the number of positive integers (m) that meet the criteria.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of positive integers ( m ) that satisfy certain conditions. Let me try to parse through the problem step by step.First, the set ( A ) is defined as:[A = left{ x mid x = a_0 + a_1 times 8 + a_2 times 8^2 + a_3 times 8^3 right}]where each ( a_i ) is in the set ( {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} ) for ( i = 0,1,2,3 ), and importantly, ( a_3 neq 0 ). So, ( A ) consists of numbers that can be represented in base 8 with up to four digits, and the leading digit ( a_3 ) can't be zero. That means ( A ) contains all 4-digit numbers in base 8, right? Because if ( a_3 ) is non-zero, it's essentially a 4-digit number in base 8.So, each element of ( A ) is a number from ( 8^3 = 512 ) up to ( 7777_8 ). Wait, let me convert ( 7777_8 ) to decimal to see the range. ( 7777_8 = 7 times 8^3 + 7 times 8^2 + 7 times 8 + 7 = 7 times 512 + 7 times 64 + 7 times 8 + 7 = 3584 + 448 + 56 + 7 = 4095 ). So, ( A ) contains all integers from 512 to 4095 in decimal.Now, the problem states that positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) are in ( A ), satisfy ( m + n = 2018 ), and ( m > n ). We need to find the number of such ( m ).So, essentially, we're looking for pairs ( (m, n) ) where both ( m ) and ( n ) are in ( A ), their sum is 2018, and ( m ) is larger than ( n ). Since ( m > n ), each pair is unique, and we just need to count how many such ( m ) exist.First, let's note that since ( m ) and ( n ) are in ( A ), they must be between 512 and 4095. Also, their sum is 2018. So, ( m ) must be greater than 2018/2, which is 1009, because ( m > n ) and ( m + n = 2018 ). So, ( m ) must be in the range ( (1009, 2018) ), but also ( m ) must be at least 512, but since 1009 is greater than 512, the lower bound is 1009.But wait, actually, ( m ) must be in ( A ), so ( m ) must be between 512 and 4095, but since ( m + n = 2018 ), ( m ) can't be more than 2018 - 512 = 1506, because ( n ) has to be at least 512. So, ( m ) is in the range ( (1009, 1506) ).Wait, let me think again. If ( m + n = 2018 ), then ( n = 2018 - m ). Since ( n ) must also be in ( A ), which is between 512 and 4095. So, ( n geq 512 ) implies ( m leq 2018 - 512 = 1506 ). Similarly, ( n leq 4095 ) implies ( m geq 2018 - 4095 = -2077 ), but since ( m ) is positive, this doesn't add any new information.But since ( m > n ), ( m ) must be greater than 2018/2 = 1009. So, ( m ) is in the range ( (1009, 1506] ). But ( m ) must also be in ( A ), so ( m ) must be a 4-digit base 8 number, which is between 512 and 4095. So, the upper limit is 1506, which is less than 4095, so that's okay.So, ( m ) must be an integer in ( A ) such that ( 1009 < m leq 1506 ). So, the number of such ( m ) is equal to the number of elements in ( A ) within that interval.But wait, is that all? Because even if ( m ) is in ( A ) and within that range, ( n = 2018 - m ) also needs to be in ( A ). So, it's not just about ( m ) being in ( A ) and in that range, but also ( n ) must be in ( A ). So, we need both ( m ) and ( n ) to be in ( A ).Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of integers ( m ) in ( A ) such that ( m ) is between 1009 and 1506, and ( 2018 - m ) is also in ( A ).So, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider the base 8 representations of ( m ) and ( n ), since both are in ( A ), which are 4-digit base 8 numbers.Let me denote ( m ) as ( m = a_3 m times 8^3 + a_2 m times 8^2 + a_1 m times 8 + a_0 m ), and similarly ( n = a_3 n times 8^3 + a_2 n times 8^2 + a_1 n times 8 + a_0 n ).Since ( m + n = 2018 ), let's write 2018 in base 8 to see how the digits add up.First, let's convert 2018 to base 8.To convert 2018 to base 8:We can divide 2018 by 8 repeatedly.2018 ÷ 8 = 252 with a remainder of 2.252 ÷ 8 = 31 with a remainder of 4.31 ÷ 8 = 3 with a remainder of 7.3 ÷ 8 = 0 with a remainder of 3.So, reading the remainders from bottom to top, 2018 in base 8 is 3 7 4 2, or ( 3742_8 ).So, ( 2018_{10} = 3742_8 ).Therefore, when adding ( m ) and ( n ) in base 8, the sum is ( 3742_8 ).Since ( m ) and ( n ) are both 4-digit numbers in base 8, their sum can have a carryover into a fifth digit, but in this case, 2018 is a 4-digit number in base 8, so the carryover must have been resolved within the 4 digits.Wait, actually, ( 3742_8 ) is a 4-digit number, so when adding ( m ) and ( n ), which are also 4-digit numbers, the sum can have a carryover into the fifth digit, but in this case, the sum is exactly 4 digits, so the carryover must have been zero. Therefore, the addition of ( m ) and ( n ) in base 8 must not produce a carryover beyond the fourth digit.Wait, but 3742_8 is less than 8^4, which is 4096, so it's a 4-digit number. So, when adding two 4-digit numbers in base 8, it's possible that the sum is a 5-digit number, but in this case, it's a 4-digit number, so the carryover from the fourth digit must have been zero.Therefore, when adding ( m ) and ( n ) in base 8, each digit addition must not produce a carryover beyond the respective digit. So, for each digit position, ( a_i m + a_i n ) must be less than 8, because if it were 8 or more, there would be a carryover to the next digit, which would affect the total sum.Wait, but hold on, that's not necessarily true. Because even if there is a carryover, the total sum could still be a 4-digit number if the carryover from the fourth digit doesn't cause a fifth digit. But in this case, since the sum is 3742_8, which is a 4-digit number, the carryover from the fourth digit must have been zero. Therefore, the addition in the fourth digit must have been less than 8, so ( a_3 m + a_3 n < 8 ).Similarly, for the other digits, the addition could have carryovers, but the total sum must not result in a fifth digit. Therefore, the carryover from the fourth digit must be zero, but carryovers from lower digits can affect higher digits.Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to model the addition digit by digit, considering possible carryovers.Let me denote the digits of ( m ) as ( a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 ) and the digits of ( n ) as ( b_3, b_2, b_1, b_0 ). Then, the sum ( m + n ) in base 8 is:- ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 + 8 c_1 )- ( a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 4 + 8 c_2 )- ( a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 7 + 8 c_3 )- ( a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 3 + 8 c_4 )But since the sum is 3742_8, which is a 4-digit number, ( c_4 ) must be zero. Therefore, ( a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 3 ).So, starting from the least significant digit:1. Units place (digit 0):   ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 + 8 c_1 )   Since ( a_0, b_0 ) are digits between 0 and 7, their sum can be between 0 and 14. So, ( c_1 ) can be 0 or 1.   If ( c_1 = 0 ), then ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 ).   If ( c_1 = 1 ), then ( a_0 + b_0 = 10 ).2. Eights place (digit 1):   ( a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 4 + 8 c_2 )   Similarly, ( a_1, b_1 ) are between 0 and 7, so ( a_1 + b_1 ) is between 0 and 14. Adding ( c_1 ) (which is 0 or 1) gives between 0 and 15. So, ( c_2 ) can be 0 or 1.   If ( c_2 = 0 ), then ( a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 4 ).   If ( c_2 = 1 ), then ( a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 12 ).3. Sixty-fours place (digit 2):   ( a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 7 + 8 c_3 )   ( a_2, b_2 ) are between 0 and 7, so ( a_2 + b_2 ) is between 0 and 14. Adding ( c_2 ) (0 or 1) gives between 0 and 15. So, ( c_3 ) can be 0 or 1.   If ( c_3 = 0 ), then ( a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 7 ).   If ( c_3 = 1 ), then ( a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 15 ).4. Five-hundred-twelve place (digit 3):   ( a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 3 )   Since ( a_3, b_3 ) are between 1 and 7 (because ( a_3 neq 0 ) and ( b_3 neq 0 )), their sum is between 2 and 14. Adding ( c_3 ) (0 or 1) gives between 2 and 15. But since ( a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 3 ), and ( a_3, b_3 geq 1 ), the only possibility is ( c_3 = 0 ), ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 ).So, from digit 3, we have ( c_3 = 0 ) and ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 ).Now, let's backtrack to digit 2:From digit 3, ( c_3 = 0 ). So, in digit 2:( a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 7 ).But ( c_2 ) can be 0 or 1.Case 1: ( c_2 = 0 )Then, ( a_2 + b_2 = 7 ).Case 2: ( c_2 = 1 )Then, ( a_2 + b_2 = 6 ).Now, moving to digit 1:From digit 2, ( c_2 ) can be 0 or 1.So, in digit 1:( a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 4 + 8 c_2 ).But ( c_2 ) is either 0 or 1.Case 1: ( c_2 = 0 )Then, ( a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 4 ).Case 2: ( c_2 = 1 )Then, ( a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 12 ).But ( c_1 ) can be 0 or 1 as well.So, let's break it down further.Starting with digit 0:Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 + 8 c_1 ).Case 1: ( c_1 = 0 )Then, ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 ).Case 2: ( c_1 = 1 )Then, ( a_0 + b_0 = 10 ).So, we have four possibilities for the combination of ( c_1 ) and ( c_2 ):1. ( c_1 = 0 ), ( c_2 = 0 )2. ( c_1 = 0 ), ( c_2 = 1 )3. ( c_1 = 1 ), ( c_2 = 0 )4. ( c_1 = 1 ), ( c_2 = 1 )But we need to see which of these are possible given the constraints from digit 3 and digit 2.From digit 3, ( c_3 = 0 ), so in digit 2, ( c_2 ) can be 0 or 1, but the sum ( a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 7 ). So, depending on ( c_2 ), ( a_2 + b_2 ) is 7 or 6.Similarly, in digit 1, depending on ( c_2 ), the equation is ( a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 4 ) or 12.But let's consider each case:Case 1: ( c_1 = 0 ), ( c_2 = 0 )Then:- Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 )- Digit 1: ( a_1 + b_1 = 4 )- Digit 2: ( a_2 + b_2 = 7 )- Digit 3: ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 )Case 2: ( c_1 = 0 ), ( c_2 = 1 )Then:- Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 )- Digit 1: ( a_1 + b_1 + 0 = 12 ) (since ( c_1 = 0 ))- Digit 2: ( a_2 + b_2 = 6 )- Digit 3: ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 )But wait, in digit 1, ( a_1 + b_1 = 12 ). Since ( a_1, b_1 leq 7 ), the maximum ( a_1 + b_1 ) can be is 14, but 12 is possible. However, ( c_1 = 0 ), so the carryover from digit 0 is zero. So, ( a_1 + b_1 = 12 ) is possible.Case 3: ( c_1 = 1 ), ( c_2 = 0 )Then:- Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 10 )- Digit 1: ( a_1 + b_1 + 1 = 4 ) => ( a_1 + b_1 = 3 )- Digit 2: ( a_2 + b_2 = 7 )- Digit 3: ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 )Case 4: ( c_1 = 1 ), ( c_2 = 1 )Then:- Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 10 )- Digit 1: ( a_1 + b_1 + 1 = 12 ) => ( a_1 + b_1 = 11 )- Digit 2: ( a_2 + b_2 = 6 )- Digit 3: ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 )So, all four cases are possible.Now, for each case, we can compute the number of possible pairs ( (m, n) ) by considering the number of solutions for each digit equation.But since we need to find the number of ( m ) such that ( m ) is in ( A ) and ( n = 2018 - m ) is also in ( A ), and ( m > n ), we can compute the number of valid ( m ) by considering each case.But perhaps it's better to compute the number of possible ( m ) by considering the number of solutions for each digit equation in each case, then summing them up.Let me structure this.First, let's handle each case separately.**Case 1: ( c_1 = 0 ), ( c_2 = 0 )**- Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 )  Number of solutions: The number of non-negative integer solutions to ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 ) where ( 0 leq a_0, b_0 leq 7 ). This is ( 3 ) solutions: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).- Digit 1: ( a_1 + b_1 = 4 )  Similarly, number of solutions: ( 5 ) solutions: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).- Digit 2: ( a_2 + b_2 = 7 )  Number of solutions: ( 8 ) solutions: (0,7), (1,6), ..., (7,0).- Digit 3: ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 )  Number of solutions: Since ( a_3, b_3 geq 1 ), the possible pairs are (1,2), (2,1), (3,0) but wait, ( b_3 ) must be at least 1, so (3,0) is invalid. So, only (1,2) and (2,1). So, 2 solutions.Therefore, total number of pairs in Case 1: ( 3 times 5 times 8 times 2 = 240 ).But wait, each pair corresponds to a unique ( m ) and ( n ). However, since ( m > n ), we need to ensure that ( m ) is greater than ( n ). But in this case, since ( m ) and ( n ) are determined by their digits, and ( m ) is determined by ( a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 ), while ( n ) is determined by ( b_3, b_2, b_1, b_0 ). So, for each pair where ( m neq n ), exactly one of ( m > n ) or ( m < n ) holds. However, in our case, since ( m + n = 2018 ), and ( m > n ), we need to ensure that ( m > n ). But in the pairs we've counted, each pair is unique, but we have to consider whether ( m > n ) or ( m < n ).Wait, actually, in each case, the number of pairs where ( m > n ) is equal to the number of pairs where ( m < n ), except when ( m = n ), which is not possible here because ( 2018 ) is even, so ( m = n = 1009 ), but 1009 is not in ( A ) because ( A ) starts at 512, but 1009 is greater than 512, but wait, 1009 is less than 4095, so it is in ( A ). Wait, but 1009 is in ( A ) because it's a 4-digit number in base 8.Wait, 1009 in base 8: Let me convert 1009 to base 8.1009 ÷ 8 = 126, remainder 1126 ÷ 8 = 15, remainder 615 ÷ 8 = 1, remainder 71 ÷ 8 = 0, remainder 1So, 1009 in base 8 is 1 7 6 1, or ( 1761_8 ). So, yes, it's a 4-digit number, so it's in ( A ). Therefore, ( m = n = 1009 ) is a possible solution, but since ( m > n ) is required, we need to exclude this case.But in our current case, since ( m + n = 2018 ), and ( m = n = 1009 ) is the only case where ( m = n ). Therefore, in our total count, we have to subtract the cases where ( m = n ), but in our current case, since ( m ) and ( n ) are determined by different digit pairs, unless all digits are equal, which would require ( a_i = b_i ) for all ( i ). But in this case, since ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 ), and ( a_3, b_3 geq 1 ), the only way ( a_3 = b_3 ) is if ( a_3 = b_3 = 1.5 ), which is not possible because they are integers. Therefore, ( m ) cannot equal ( n ) in this case. So, all pairs in Case 1 are such that ( m neq n ), and exactly half of them satisfy ( m > n ).Wait, but actually, in our count for Case 1, we counted all possible pairs where ( m + n = 2018 ) with the given digit constraints. Each such pair is unique, and since ( m ) and ( n ) are distinct, exactly half of them will have ( m > n ). Therefore, the number of valid ( m ) in Case 1 is ( 240 / 2 = 120 ).Wait, but hold on. Is that accurate? Because depending on the digits, some pairs might have ( m > n ) inherently. For example, if ( a_3 > b_3 ), then ( m > n ) regardless of the other digits. If ( a_3 = b_3 ), then we look at ( a_2 ) vs ( b_2 ), and so on.But in our case, since ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 ), and ( a_3, b_3 geq 1 ), the possible pairs are (1,2) and (2,1). So, in half of the cases, ( a_3 > b_3 ), and in the other half, ( a_3 < b_3 ). Since ( a_3 ) and ( b_3 ) are determined uniquely in each case, the number of pairs where ( a_3 > b_3 ) is equal to the number where ( a_3 < b_3 ). Therefore, exactly half of the pairs will have ( m > n ).Therefore, in Case 1, the number of valid ( m ) is ( 240 / 2 = 120 ).**Case 2: ( c_1 = 0 ), ( c_2 = 1 )**- Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 2 )  Number of solutions: 3.- Digit 1: ( a_1 + b_1 = 12 )  Number of solutions: The number of non-negative integer solutions to ( a_1 + b_1 = 12 ) where ( 0 leq a_1, b_1 leq 7 ). Since 12 is greater than 7, the possible solutions are when ( a_1 = 5 ) to ( 7 ), and ( b_1 = 7 ) to ( 5 ). So, the solutions are (5,7), (6,6), (7,5). So, 3 solutions.- Digit 2: ( a_2 + b_2 = 6 )  Number of solutions: 7 solutions: (0,6), (1,5), ..., (6,0).- Digit 3: ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 )  Number of solutions: 2 solutions: (1,2), (2,1).Therefore, total number of pairs in Case 2: ( 3 times 3 times 7 times 2 = 126 ).Similarly, as in Case 1, exactly half of these pairs will have ( m > n ). So, number of valid ( m ) is ( 126 / 2 = 63 ).**Case 3: ( c_1 = 1 ), ( c_2 = 0 )**- Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 10 )  Number of solutions: The number of non-negative integer solutions to ( a_0 + b_0 = 10 ) where ( 0 leq a_0, b_0 leq 7 ). The possible solutions are (3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4), (7,3). So, 5 solutions.- Digit 1: ( a_1 + b_1 = 3 )  Number of solutions: 4 solutions: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0).- Digit 2: ( a_2 + b_2 = 7 )  Number of solutions: 8 solutions.- Digit 3: ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 )  Number of solutions: 2 solutions.Total number of pairs in Case 3: ( 5 times 4 times 8 times 2 = 320 ).Again, exactly half of these pairs will have ( m > n ). So, number of valid ( m ) is ( 320 / 2 = 160 ).**Case 4: ( c_1 = 1 ), ( c_2 = 1 )**- Digit 0: ( a_0 + b_0 = 10 )  Number of solutions: 5.- Digit 1: ( a_1 + b_1 = 11 )  Number of solutions: The number of non-negative integer solutions to ( a_1 + b_1 = 11 ) where ( 0 leq a_1, b_1 leq 7 ). The possible solutions are (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4). So, 4 solutions.- Digit 2: ( a_2 + b_2 = 6 )  Number of solutions: 7.- Digit 3: ( a_3 + b_3 = 3 )  Number of solutions: 2.Total number of pairs in Case 4: ( 5 times 4 times 7 times 2 = 280 ).Number of valid ( m ) is ( 280 / 2 = 140 ).Now, summing up the valid ( m ) from all four cases:Case 1: 120Case 2: 63Case 3: 160Case 4: 140Total: ( 120 + 63 + 160 + 140 = 483 ).But wait, hold on. Let me double-check the calculations.Case 1: 3 * 5 * 8 * 2 = 240, divided by 2 is 120. Correct.Case 2: 3 * 3 * 7 * 2 = 126, divided by 2 is 63. Correct.Case 3: 5 * 4 * 8 * 2 = 320, divided by 2 is 160. Correct.Case 4: 5 * 4 * 7 * 2 = 280, divided by 2 is 140. Correct.Total: 120 + 63 = 183, 183 + 160 = 343, 343 + 140 = 483.So, 483 valid ( m ).But wait, let me think again. Is there any overlap between these cases? For example, could a particular ( m ) be counted in more than one case? I don't think so, because each case corresponds to different carryover scenarios, so each ( m ) is uniquely determined by its digit additions and carryovers. Therefore, the total should be 483.However, let me verify this with another approach.Another way to think about it is that since ( m ) and ( n ) are in ( A ), and ( m + n = 2018 ), the number of such ( m ) is equal to the number of pairs ( (m, n) ) where ( m, n in A ), ( m + n = 2018 ), and ( m > n ).Since ( A ) is a set of numbers from 512 to 4095, and 2018 is within this range, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of solutions to ( m + n = 2018 ) with ( m, n in A ) and ( m > n ).But since ( A ) is a set of numbers with base 8 digits, the number of solutions is determined by the digit-wise addition constraints, which we've already considered in the four cases above.Therefore, 483 seems to be the correct count.Wait, but let me think about the range of ( m ). Earlier, I thought ( m ) is between 1009 and 1506. Let me check how many numbers are in ( A ) in that range.But ( A ) is all numbers from 512 to 4095, so the numbers between 1009 and 1506 are all in ( A ). So, the number of ( m ) is 1506 - 1009 + 1 = 498. But our count is 483, which is less than 498, which makes sense because not all numbers in that range will have their complement ( n = 2018 - m ) also in ( A ).Therefore, 483 is plausible.But let me check if 483 is the correct answer or if I made a miscalculation in the number of solutions per case.Wait, let's recalculate each case:Case 1:- Digit 0: 3 solutions- Digit 1: 5 solutions- Digit 2: 8 solutions- Digit 3: 2 solutionsTotal: 3 * 5 * 8 * 2 = 240Divide by 2: 120Case 2:- Digit 0: 3- Digit 1: 3- Digit 2: 7- Digit 3: 2Total: 3 * 3 * 7 * 2 = 126Divide by 2: 63Case 3:- Digit 0: 5- Digit 1: 4- Digit 2: 8- Digit 3: 2Total: 5 * 4 * 8 * 2 = 320Divide by 2: 160Case 4:- Digit 0: 5- Digit 1: 4- Digit 2: 7- Digit 3: 2Total: 5 * 4 * 7 * 2 = 280Divide by 2: 140So, 120 + 63 + 160 + 140 = 483.Yes, that seems consistent.Therefore, the number of positive integers ( m ) that meet the criteria is 483.**Final Answer**The number of positive integers ( m ) is boxed{483}."},{"question":"A school conducts a stratified sampling survey to gather information on the students' awareness of a major school event.

Compute the largest positive integer  n  such that  n = s(n)^2 + 2s(n) - 2. ","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Given a positive integer ( n ), let ( s(n) ) denote the sum of the digits of ( n ). I need to compute the largest positive integer ( n ) such that ( n = s(n)^2 + 2s(n) - 2 ). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I need to find the largest ( n ) where ( n ) is equal to ( s(n)^2 + 2s(n) - 2 ). So, ( n ) is expressed in terms of the sum of its digits. That seems interesting because ( s(n) ) is generally much smaller than ( n ) itself, especially for larger numbers. So, this equation is kind of tying ( n ) to a quadratic function of its digit sum.Let me denote ( s(n) ) as ( k ) for simplicity. So, the equation becomes ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ). My goal is to find the largest ( n ) such that this holds, which also means I need to find the largest ( k ) such that ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ) and ( s(n) = k ).So, essentially, I need to find ( k ) such that when I compute ( k^2 + 2k - 2 ), the sum of the digits of that number is equal to ( k ). Then, among all such ( k ), I need the largest one, which would give me the largest ( n ).Okay, so let me think about how to approach this. Since ( s(n) = k ), and ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ), I can write ( s(k^2 + 2k - 2) = k ). So, the sum of the digits of ( k^2 + 2k - 2 ) is equal to ( k ).Now, I know that the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9. That is, ( s(n) equiv n mod 9 ). So, ( k equiv n mod 9 ). But since ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ), we have ( k equiv k^2 + 2k - 2 mod 9 ). Let me write that down:( k equiv k^2 + 2k - 2 mod 9 )Simplify this congruence:Subtract ( k ) from both sides:( 0 equiv k^2 + k - 2 mod 9 )So, ( k^2 + k - 2 equiv 0 mod 9 )Let me solve this quadratic congruence for ( k ) modulo 9. That is, find all integers ( k ) between 0 and 8 such that ( k^2 + k - 2 equiv 0 mod 9 ).Let me compute ( k^2 + k - 2 ) for ( k = 0 ) to ( 8 ):- ( k = 0: 0 + 0 - 2 = -2 equiv 7 mod 9 ) → Not 0- ( k = 1: 1 + 1 - 2 = 0 mod 9 ) → Yes- ( k = 2: 4 + 2 - 2 = 4 mod 9 ) → Not 0- ( k = 3: 9 + 3 - 2 = 10 ≡ 1 mod 9 ) → Not 0- ( k = 4: 16 + 4 - 2 = 18 ≡ 0 mod 9 ) → Yes- ( k = 5: 25 + 5 - 2 = 28 ≡ 1 mod 9 ) → Not 0- ( k = 6: 36 + 6 - 2 = 40 ≡ 4 mod 9 ) → Not 0- ( k = 7: 49 + 7 - 2 = 54 ≡ 0 mod 9 ) → Yes- ( k = 8: 64 + 8 - 2 = 70 ≡ 7 mod 9 ) → Not 0So, the solutions modulo 9 are ( k ≡ 1, 4, 7 mod 9 ). That means ( k ) can be written as ( 9m + 1 ), ( 9m + 4 ), or ( 9m + 7 ) for some integer ( m geq 0 ).This gives me a starting point. So, ( k ) must be congruent to 1, 4, or 7 modulo 9. Therefore, possible values of ( k ) are 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, etc.But since ( k = s(n) ), and ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ), ( k ) can't be too large because the sum of digits of ( n ) is at most ( 9 times ) (number of digits of ( n )). So, for a number ( n ) with ( d ) digits, ( s(n) leq 9d ). On the other hand, ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ) is roughly ( k^2 ). So, ( k^2 ) must be less than or equal to ( 9d times 10^{d-1} ) or something like that? Hmm, maybe that's too vague.Alternatively, perhaps I can bound ( k ). Let's see. Since ( s(n) = k ), and ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ), we have ( k leq s(n) leq 9 times ) (number of digits of ( n )). The number of digits of ( n ) is roughly ( log_{10} n + 1 ). So, ( k leq 9 (log_{10} n + 1) ). But ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ), so ( n ) is roughly ( k^2 ). Therefore, ( k leq 9 (log_{10} (k^2) + 1) ).Hmm, that might be a bit complicated, but perhaps I can get an upper bound for ( k ). Let me try plugging in some numbers.Let me first compute ( n ) for some ( k ) values and see if ( s(n) = k ).Starting with small ( k ):- ( k = 1 ): ( n = 1 + 2 - 2 = 1 ). ( s(1) = 1 ). So, this works.- ( k = 4 ): ( n = 16 + 8 - 2 = 22 ). ( s(22) = 2 + 2 = 4 ). So, this works.- ( k = 7 ): ( n = 49 + 14 - 2 = 61 ). ( s(61) = 6 + 1 = 7 ). This works too.Okay, so these are valid. Now, let's try the next possible ( k ) values.- ( k = 10 ): ( n = 100 + 20 - 2 = 118 ). ( s(118) = 1 + 1 + 8 = 10 ). So, this works as well.- ( k = 13 ): ( n = 169 + 26 - 2 = 193 ). ( s(193) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13 ). Perfect, this works.- ( k = 16 ): ( n = 256 + 32 - 2 = 286 ). ( s(286) = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 ). Nice, that works.- ( k = 19 ): ( n = 361 + 38 - 2 = 397 ). ( s(397) = 3 + 9 + 7 = 19 ). That works too.Hmm, so far, all the ( k ) values that are 1, 4, 7 mod 9 seem to work. Let me check the next one.- ( k = 22 ): ( n = 484 + 44 - 2 = 526 ). ( s(526) = 5 + 2 + 6 = 13 ). Wait, that's not equal to 22. So, this doesn't work.Hmm, interesting. So, ( k = 22 ) doesn't work. Let me check my calculation.( k = 22 ): ( 22^2 = 484 ), ( 2*22 = 44 ), so ( 484 + 44 - 2 = 526 ). Sum of digits: 5 + 2 + 6 = 13. So, indeed, 13 ≠ 22. So, ( k = 22 ) is invalid.So, that breaks the pattern. So, not all ( k ) congruent to 1,4,7 mod 9 will satisfy ( s(n) = k ). So, I need to find the maximum ( k ) such that ( s(k^2 + 2k - 2) = k ).So, perhaps I need to check each ( k ) in the sequence 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22,... and see if ( s(n) = k ). Since ( k = 22 ) didn't work, maybe the next one also doesn't? Let's check.- ( k = 25 ): ( n = 625 + 50 - 2 = 673 ). ( s(673) = 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 ). Not 25. Doesn't work.- ( k = 28 ): ( n = 784 + 56 - 2 = 838 ). ( s(838) = 8 + 3 + 8 = 19 ). Not 28. Doesn't work.- ( k = 31 ): ( n = 961 + 62 - 2 = 1021 ). ( s(1021) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 4 ). Not 31. Doesn't work.Hmm, so it seems after ( k = 19 ), the next ( k ) values don't satisfy ( s(n) = k ). So, maybe ( k = 19 ) is the largest one that works. But let's verify.Wait, before that, let me check ( k = 22 ) again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.( k = 22 ): ( 22^2 = 484 ), ( 2*22 = 44 ), so ( 484 + 44 = 528 ), minus 2 is 526. Sum of digits: 5 + 2 + 6 = 13. So, no, that's correct. So, ( k = 22 ) gives ( s(n) = 13 ), which is less than 22.Similarly, ( k = 25 ) gives ( s(n) = 16 ), which is less than 25. So, maybe the trend is that as ( k ) increases, the sum of digits of ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ) doesn't keep up with ( k ). So, perhaps ( k = 19 ) is the last one that works.But just to be thorough, let me check ( k = 34 ): ( n = 34^2 + 2*34 - 2 = 1156 + 68 - 2 = 1222 ). ( s(1222) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 ). Not 34.( k = 37 ): ( n = 1369 + 74 - 2 = 1441 ). ( s(1441) = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10 ). Not 37.( k = 40 ): ( n = 1600 + 80 - 2 = 1678 ). ( s(1678) = 1 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 22 ). Not 40.Hmm, so it's clear that as ( k ) increases, the sum of digits is not keeping up. So, ( s(n) ) is growing much slower than ( k ). Therefore, it's likely that ( k = 19 ) is the largest value where ( s(n) = k ).But just to make sure, let me check ( k = 19 ) again.( k = 19 ): ( n = 361 + 38 - 2 = 397 ). ( s(397) = 3 + 9 + 7 = 19 ). Perfect, that's correct.So, is 397 the largest such ( n )? Wait, but let me check if there are larger ( k ) beyond 19 that might work. Wait, I checked ( k = 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40 ), and none of them worked. So, it's likely that 19 is the maximum ( k ).But just to be thorough, let me check ( k = 16 ): ( n = 256 + 32 - 2 = 286 ). ( s(286) = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 ). So, that works.Wait, so 286 is less than 397, so 397 is larger.Wait, but hold on, is 397 the largest? Let me check ( k = 19 ) gives ( n = 397 ). Let me check ( k = 20 ): ( n = 400 + 40 - 2 = 438 ). ( s(438) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 ). Not 20.( k = 21 ): ( n = 441 + 42 - 2 = 481 ). ( s(481) = 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 ). Not 21.So, even ( k = 20 ) and ( k = 21 ) don't work. So, 19 is indeed the next after 16, and it works. So, 19 is the largest ( k ) so far. But let me check ( k = 19 + 9 = 28 ), which I already did, and it didn't work.Wait, but actually, the next ( k ) after 19 would be 28, but that didn't work. So, perhaps 19 is the maximum.But just to be extra careful, let me check ( k = 19 + 9 = 28 ), which I already did, and it didn't work. Then ( k = 37 ), which also didn't work. So, yeah, 19 is the maximum.Therefore, the largest ( n ) is 397.But hold on, let me check ( k = 19 ) again: ( n = 19^2 + 2*19 - 2 = 361 + 38 - 2 = 397 ). Sum of digits: 3 + 9 + 7 = 19. Perfect.Is there a larger ( k ) beyond 19 that could work? Let me think.Wait, what about ( k = 100 ): ( n = 10000 + 200 - 2 = 10198 ). ( s(10198) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 9 + 8 = 19 ). Not 100.So, even for ( k = 100 ), the sum is 19, which is way less than 100. So, definitely, the sum of digits doesn't increase as fast as ( k ).Therefore, I can conclude that the largest ( k ) is 19, which gives ( n = 397 ).Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check ( k = 19 ) and see if there is a larger ( n ) beyond that. For example, is there a ( k ) larger than 19 such that ( s(n) = k )?Wait, for ( k = 20 ), ( n = 438 ), which has digit sum 15. For ( k = 21 ), ( n = 481 ), digit sum 13. For ( k = 22 ), ( n = 526 ), digit sum 13. For ( k = 23 ), ( n = 529 + 46 - 2 = 573 ). ( s(573) = 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 ). Not 23.Similarly, ( k = 24 ): ( n = 576 + 48 - 2 = 622 ). ( s(622) = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 ). Not 24.( k = 25 ): ( n = 625 + 50 - 2 = 673 ). ( s(673) = 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 ). Not 25.So, it's clear that beyond ( k = 19 ), the digit sum doesn't reach ( k ). Therefore, 19 is indeed the maximum ( k ).Therefore, the largest ( n ) is 397.But wait, hold on. Let me check ( k = 19 ) and see if there's a larger ( n ) beyond that.Wait, ( k = 19 ) gives ( n = 397 ). Let me check ( k = 19 + 9 = 28 ), which gives ( n = 838 ), but ( s(838) = 19 ), which is less than 28. So, no.Similarly, ( k = 37 ) gives ( n = 1441 ), which has a digit sum of 10, which is way less than 37.Therefore, 397 is indeed the largest ( n ) satisfying the condition.Wait, but hold on, let me check ( k = 19 ) again. Is there a way that a larger ( k ) could result in a larger ( n ) with ( s(n) = k )?Wait, for ( k = 19 ), ( n = 397 ). If I take ( k = 20 ), ( n = 438 ), which is larger than 397, but ( s(n) = 15 ), which is less than 20. So, even though ( n ) is larger, it doesn't satisfy ( s(n) = k ).Similarly, ( k = 21 ): ( n = 481 ), which is larger than 397, but ( s(n) = 13 ), which is less than 21.So, even though ( n ) increases beyond 397, the digit sum doesn't keep up with ( k ). Therefore, 397 is the largest ( n ) where ( s(n) = k ) and ( n = k^2 + 2k - 2 ).Therefore, after all these checks, I can confidently say that the largest positive integer ( n ) satisfying the given condition is 397.**Final Answer**The largest positive integer ( n ) is boxed{397}."},{"question":"In the polar coordinate system, it is known that the point is (4, frac{pi}{4}), and the equation of the line is rho sin(theta + frac{pi}{4}) = 1.(1) Find the Cartesian coordinates of the point (4, frac{pi}{4}) and the standard form of the line's equation.(2) Calculate the distance from the point (4, frac{pi}{4}) to the line rho sin(theta + frac{pi}{4}) = 1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here in polar coordinates. It says that there's a point (4, π/4) and a line given by the equation ρ sin(θ + π/4) = 1. I need to do two things: first, find the Cartesian coordinates of the point and the standard form of the line's equation. Second, calculate the distance from that point to the line.Alright, let's start with part (1). I remember that converting from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates involves using the formulas x = ρ cos θ and y = ρ sin θ. So for the point (4, π/4), ρ is 4 and θ is π/4.Let me compute x first. x = 4 cos(π/4). Cos(π/4) is √2/2, so x = 4*(√2/2) = 2√2. Similarly, y = 4 sin(π/4). Sin(π/4) is also √2/2, so y = 4*(√2/2) = 2√2. So the Cartesian coordinates of the point should be (2√2, 2√2). That seems straightforward.Now, for the line equation ρ sin(θ + π/4) = 1. I need to convert this into the standard Cartesian form. I recall that in polar coordinates, equations can often be converted using the relationships x = ρ cos θ and y = ρ sin θ. Also, there's an identity for sin(θ + φ), which is sin θ cos φ + cos θ sin φ.So let's apply that identity to sin(θ + π/4). That would be sin θ cos(π/4) + cos θ sin(π/4). Since cos(π/4) and sin(π/4) are both √2/2, this becomes (√2/2) sin θ + (√2/2) cos θ.So substituting back into the equation, we have ρ [ (√2/2) sin θ + (√2/2) cos θ ] = 1. Let's distribute the ρ: (√2/2) ρ sin θ + (√2/2) ρ cos θ = 1.But wait, in Cartesian coordinates, ρ sin θ is y and ρ cos θ is x. So substituting those in, we get (√2/2) y + (√2/2) x = 1.Let me write that out: (√2/2)x + (√2/2)y = 1. To make this look neater, maybe factor out √2/2: √2/2 (x + y) = 1. If I multiply both sides by 2/√2 to simplify, that would give x + y = √2.So the standard form of the line's equation is x + y = √2. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check my steps. Starting from ρ sin(θ + π/4) = 1, expanded using the sine addition formula, substituted x and y, and simplified. Yep, that looks right.Alright, so part (1) is done. The Cartesian coordinates are (2√2, 2√2) and the line equation is x + y = √2.Moving on to part (2): calculating the distance from the point (2√2, 2√2) to the line x + y = √2. I remember the formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax₀ + by₀ + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). So first, I need to write the line equation in the form ax + by + c = 0.The given line is x + y = √2. Subtracting √2 from both sides gives x + y - √2 = 0. So a = 1, b = 1, c = -√2.Now, plugging into the distance formula: |1*(2√2) + 1*(2√2) - √2| / sqrt(1² + 1²). Let's compute the numerator first.1*(2√2) is 2√2, and 1*(2√2) is another 2√2. Adding those together gives 4√2. Then subtract √2: 4√2 - √2 = 3√2. Taking the absolute value, which is still 3√2.The denominator is sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). So the distance is 3√2 / sqrt(2). Simplifying that, sqrt(2) cancels out, leaving 3. So the distance is 3 units.Wait, let me verify that calculation again. The point is (2√2, 2√2), the line is x + y - √2 = 0. So plugging into the formula: |2√2 + 2√2 - √2| / sqrt(2). That's |(2√2 + 2√2) - √2| = |4√2 - √2| = |3√2|. So numerator is 3√2, denominator is sqrt(2). So 3√2 / sqrt(2) = 3*(√2 / sqrt(2)) = 3*1 = 3. Yep, that's correct.So the distance is 3. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering the point is (2√2, 2√2), which is approximately (2.828, 2.828), and the line x + y = √2 is approximately x + y = 1.414, so the distance should indeed be more than 1.414. Wait, actually, 3 is more than that, but let me visualize.The line x + y = √2 is a straight line in the first quadrant, passing through (0, √2) and (√2, 0). The point (2√2, 2√2) is further out in the first quadrant. The distance from this point to the line should be significant. Let me compute the distance another way to confirm.Alternatively, I can use the formula for distance in polar coordinates. Wait, but I think the Cartesian method is straightforward and I already did it, so I think 3 is correct.Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using vectors or parametric equations, but that might complicate things. I think the formula I used is reliable.So, to recap: For part (1), Cartesian coordinates are (2√2, 2√2), and the line equation is x + y = √2. For part (2), the distance is 3.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.**Final Answer**(1) The Cartesian coordinates are boxed{(2sqrt{2}, 2sqrt{2})} and the standard form of the line's equation is boxed{x + y = sqrt{2}}.(2) The distance from the point to the line is boxed{3}."},{"question":"A three-digit number is 56 times greater than its last digit. By how many times is it greater than its first digit? Justify your answer.","answer":"First, I recognize that the number is a three-digit number, which means it can be expressed as 100 times the first digit plus 10 times the second digit plus the third digit. Let's denote the first digit as ( a ), the second digit as ( b ), and the third digit as ( c ). Therefore, the number can be written as ( 100a + 10b + c ).According to the problem, the number is 56 times greater than its last digit. This gives us the equation:[100a + 10b + c = 56c]Simplifying this equation, we get:[100a + 10b = 55c][20a + 2b = 11c]Since ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are digits (0-9), and ( a ) cannot be zero (as it's a three-digit number), we can analyze possible values for ( c ) that satisfy the equation. Testing ( c = 8 ) yields:[20a + 2b = 88][10a + b = 44]This implies that ( a = 4 ) and ( b = 4 ), making the number 448.

What is the difference between the largest and smallest five-digit palindromic numbers that are both multiples of 45?","answer":"To determine the difference between the largest and smallest five-digit palindromic numbers that are multiples of 45, I'll start by understanding the structure of a five-digit palindrome. A five-digit palindrome has the form ABCBA, where A, B, and C are digits, and A cannot be zero.Next, I need to ensure that the number is a multiple of 45. Since 45 is the product of 9 and 5, the number must satisfy the divisibility rules for both 9 and 5. For divisibility by 5, the last digit (A) must be either 0 or 5. However, since A cannot be zero in a five-digit number, A must be 5.For divisibility by 9, the sum of all digits must be a multiple of 9. This means that 5 + B + C + B + 5 = 10 + 2B + C must be divisible by 9.To find the smallest such number, I'll start with the smallest possible values for B and C. Setting B to 0, I solve for C in the equation 10 + C ≡ 0 (mod 9), which gives C = 8. Thus, the smallest number is 50805.For the largest number, I'll use the largest possible values for B and C. Setting B to 9, I solve for C in the equation 28 + C ≡ 0 (mod 9), which gives C = 8.

They've given me the number of ways to cut out 1x2 and 1x3 rectangles, which are 940 and 894 respectively. Hmm, interesting. I guess I need to figure out the relationship between these numbers and then use that to find the number for 1x5.First, let me recall that when counting the number of ways to cut out a 1xk rectangle in a grid, it depends on the dimensions of the grid. If the grid has m rows and n columns, then the number of horizontal 1xk rectangles would be (m) * (n - k + 1), and the number of vertical 1xk rectangles would be (n) * (m - k + 1). So, the total number of ways is the sum of these two.Wait, so for a 1x2 rectangle, the number of ways is m*(n - 1) + n*(m - 1). Similarly, for 1x3, it's m*(n - 2) + n*(m - 2). And for 1x5, it would be m*(n - 4) + n*(m - 4). So, if I can find m and n, I can compute the number for 1x5.But I don't know m and n. They just told me the total number for 1x2 and 1x3. So, maybe I can set up equations based on that.Let me denote:Let m be the number of rows, n be the number of columns.Then, for 1x2:Total ways = m*(n - 1) + n*(m - 1) = 940Similarly, for 1x3:Total ways = m*(n - 2) + n*(m - 2) = 894So, I have two equations:1) m(n - 1) + n(m - 1) = 9402) m(n - 2) + n(m - 2) = 894Let me simplify these equations.Starting with equation 1:m(n - 1) + n(m - 1) = mn - m + mn - n = 2mn - m - n = 940Similarly, equation 2:m(n - 2) + n(m - 2) = mn - 2m + mn - 2n = 2mn - 2m - 2n = 894So now, I have:Equation 1: 2mn - m - n = 940Equation 2: 2mn - 2m - 2n = 894Hmm, okay, so if I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, I can eliminate 2mn.Let me compute:(2mn - m - n) - (2mn - 2m - 2n) = 940 - 894Simplify:2mn - m - n - 2mn + 2m + 2n = 46Which simplifies to:( -m + 2m ) + ( -n + 2n ) = 46So, m + n = 46Alright, so m + n = 46. That's one equation.Now, let's go back to equation 1: 2mn - m - n = 940But since m + n = 46, let's substitute that in.So, 2mn - (m + n) = 940Which becomes:2mn - 46 = 940So, 2mn = 940 + 46 = 986Therefore, mn = 986 / 2 = 493So, mn = 493So, now I have m + n = 46 and m*n = 493So, I can set up a quadratic equation where m and n are roots.Let me denote x = m, then n = 46 - xSo, x*(46 - x) = 493Which is:46x - x² = 493Rearranged:x² - 46x + 493 = 0Let me solve this quadratic equation.Discriminant D = 46² - 4*1*493Compute 46²: 46*46. Let me compute 40² + 2*40*6 + 6² = 1600 + 480 + 36 = 2116So, D = 2116 - 4*493Compute 4*493: 493*4. 400*4=1600, 90*4=360, 3*4=12. So, 1600+360=1960+12=1972So, D = 2116 - 1972 = 144Square root of 144 is 12.So, solutions are:x = [46 ± 12]/2So, x = (46 + 12)/2 = 58/2 = 29Or x = (46 - 12)/2 = 34/2 = 17So, m and n are 29 and 17. Since m and n are just rows and columns, it doesn't matter which is which.So, m = 29, n = 17 or m = 17, n = 29.Either way, the grid is 29x17.Now, with m and n known, I can compute the number of 1x5 rectangles.As I mentioned earlier, the number of 1x5 rectangles is m*(n - 4) + n*(m - 4)So, let's compute that.First, m = 29, n = 17.Compute m*(n - 4) = 29*(17 - 4) = 29*1329*10=290, 29*3=87, so 290+87=377Similarly, n*(m - 4) = 17*(29 - 4) = 17*2517*20=340, 17*5=85, so 340+85=425So, total number of 1x5 rectangles is 377 + 425 = 802Wait, let me verify that.29*13: 29*10=290, 29*3=87, so 290+87=377.

Correct.So, that seems consistent.So, the answer is 802.**Final Answer**The number of ways to cut out a 1 times 5 rectangle is boxed{802}."},{"question":"In a class of 30 students, 15 students like basketball, 10 students like table tennis, and 8 students do not like either of these sports.

Let me read it again: Given vectors a = (3, sqrt(3)) and b = (0, x), if the dot product of a and b equals the magnitude of a, then find the real number x. Hmm, okay. I need to find x such that a · b = |a|. Alright, let me recall what the dot product is. The dot product of two vectors is calculated by multiplying their corresponding components and then adding those products together. So, for vectors a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2), the dot product a · b is a1*b1 + a2*b2. So, applying that to the given vectors: a is (3, sqrt(3)) and b is (0, x). Therefore, the dot product a · b should be 3*0 + sqrt(3)*x. Let me write that down:a · b = 3*0 + sqrt(3)*x = 0 + sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)x.Okay, so the dot product is sqrt(3)x. Now, the problem states that this dot product equals the magnitude of vector a. So, I need to find the magnitude of vector a first.The magnitude of a vector a = (a1, a2) is given by the formula |a| = sqrt(a1^2 + a2^2). So, plugging in the components of vector a:|a| = sqrt(3^2 + (sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(9 + 3) = sqrt(12). Wait, sqrt(12) can be simplified, right? sqrt(12) is equal to 2*sqrt(3). So, |a| is 2*sqrt(3).So, according to the problem, a · b = |a|, which means sqrt(3)x = 2*sqrt(3). Now, I need to solve for x. Let me write that equation again:sqrt(3)x = 2*sqrt(3).Hmm, okay, so if I divide both sides of the equation by sqrt(3), that should isolate x. Let's do that:x = (2*sqrt(3)) / sqrt(3).Simplifying the right side, the sqrt(3) in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, so x = 2.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, I calculated the dot product: 3*0 + sqrt(3)*x, which is sqrt(3)x. That seems right.Then, I found the magnitude of a: sqrt(3^2 + (sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(9 + 3) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). That also seems correct.Setting them equal: sqrt(3)x = 2*sqrt(3). Dividing both sides by sqrt(3) gives x = 2. Yep, that looks good.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the geometric definition of the dot product? Let me think.The dot product can also be expressed as |a||b|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between vectors a and b. So, if a · b = |a||b|cos(theta) = |a|, then we can write |a||b|cos(theta) = |a|. Dividing both sides by |a| (assuming |a| ≠ 0, which it isn't because |a| is 2*sqrt(3)), we get |b|cos(theta) = 1.Hmm, so |b|cos(theta) = 1. But |b| is the magnitude of vector b, which is (0, x). So, |b| is sqrt(0^2 + x^2) = |x|. So, |x|cos(theta) = 1.But I don't know theta, the angle between a and b. Maybe I can find cos(theta) from the dot product formula.Wait, but I already have a · b = sqrt(3)x, and that's equal to |a|. So, maybe this approach isn't necessary, but it's good to verify.Alternatively, maybe I can find the angle theta between a and b. Let me see.We know that a · b = |a||b|cos(theta). So, sqrt(3)x = |a||b|cos(theta). But since sqrt(3)x = |a|, which is 2*sqrt(3), we can write 2*sqrt(3) = |a||b|cos(theta).But |a| is 2*sqrt(3), so substituting that in:2*sqrt(3) = (2*sqrt(3))|b|cos(theta).Dividing both sides by 2*sqrt(3):1 = |b|cos(theta).Which is the same as before. So, |b|cos(theta) = 1. Since |b| is |x|, we have |x|cos(theta) = 1.But without knowing theta, I can't directly find x. So, maybe this approach isn't helpful here. It seems like the algebraic method is more straightforward.Wait, another thought: since vector b is (0, x), it's a vertical vector along the y-axis. Vector a is (3, sqrt(3)), which is in the first quadrant. The angle between them can be found, but maybe I don't need it.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the projection of a onto b or something like that. But again, since b is along the y-axis, the projection of a onto b would just be the y-component of a, which is sqrt(3). But wait, the projection is |a|cos(theta), which is equal to (a · b)/|b|. Wait, let's see: projection of a onto b is (a · b)/|b|. So, in this case, (sqrt(3)x)/|x|. Since |x| is sqrt(0^2 + x^2) = |x|, so projection is (sqrt(3)x)/|x|. But if x is positive, that would be sqrt(3); if x is negative, that would be -sqrt(3). But the projection is a scalar, so it can be positive or negative depending on the direction. However, in this problem, we have a · b = |a|, which is positive, so x must be positive because sqrt(3)x is positive.Wait, but the projection is (sqrt(3)x)/|x|, which is sqrt(3) if x is positive, and -sqrt(3) if x is negative. But since a · b is equal to |a|, which is positive, x must be positive. So, the projection is sqrt(3). But |a| is 2*sqrt(3), so the projection of a onto b is sqrt(3). Hmm, so that means that the component of a in the direction of b is sqrt(3). But since b is along the y-axis, the projection is just the y-component of a, which is sqrt(3). So, that makes sense.But I'm not sure if this line of thinking helps me find x. It just confirms that the projection is sqrt(3), which is consistent with a · b = |a|.Wait, maybe I can think about the relationship between the projection and the magnitude. The projection of a onto b is equal to |a|cos(theta), which is equal to (a · b)/|b|. So, in this case, (a · b)/|b| = |a|cos(theta). But since a · b = |a|, we have |a| / |b| = |a|cos(theta). Dividing both sides by |a| (since |a| ≠ 0), we get 1 / |b| = cos(theta). So, cos(theta) = 1 / |b|. But |b| is |x|, so cos(theta) = 1 / |x|. But we also know that cos(theta) is equal to (a · b) / (|a||b|). From earlier, a · b = |a|, so cos(theta) = |a| / (|a||b|) = 1 / |b|. So, that's consistent.But I still don't see how this helps me find x. Maybe I need to find theta? Let me see.Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that vector b is along the y-axis, so the angle theta between a and b is the angle between a and the y-axis. So, if I can find that angle, maybe I can relate it.But without knowing theta, I can't really do much. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the algebraic method.So, going back, we had sqrt(3)x = 2*sqrt(3). Dividing both sides by sqrt(3) gives x = 2. So, x is 2. Wait, is there any possibility that x could be negative? Let me check.If x were negative, then the dot product would be sqrt(3)*x, which would be negative. But the magnitude |a| is positive, so the dot product must be positive. Therefore, x must be positive. So, x = 2 is the only solution.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes.1. Given vectors a = (3, sqrt(3)) and b = (0, x).2. Compute the dot product: a · b = 3*0 + sqrt(3)*x = sqrt(3)x.3. Compute the magnitude of a: |a| = sqrt(3^2 + (sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt(9 + 3) = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3).4. Set the dot product equal to |a|: sqrt(3)x = 2*sqrt(3).5. Solve for x: x = 2.Yes, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that x is 2.**Final Answer**The real number ( x ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"We draw 6 circles of equal radius on the surface of a unit sphere such that the circles do not intersect.

The key here is that the circles don't intersect each other. Hmm, interesting. I remember that on a sphere, circles can be thought of as the set of points at a fixed distance from a central point, kind of like how latitude lines work on Earth. But in this case, we're dealing with six circles, so maybe they're arranged in some symmetric fashion.First, let me recall that the unit sphere has a radius of 1. So, the circles we're talking about are on the surface of this sphere. The radius of each circle would then be the angular distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference. I think this is called the angular radius. So, if I can find the angular radius, I can relate it back to the actual radius on the sphere's surface.Now, if we have six circles that don't intersect, their centers must be spaced apart in such a way that the distance between any two centers is more than twice the angular radius. Because if the distance between centers is less than or equal to twice the angular radius, the circles would overlap. So, the angular distance between any two centers should be greater than 2r, where r is the angular radius of each circle.Wait, actually, on a sphere, the distance between two points is measured along the great circle connecting them. So, the angular distance between two centers is the angle between the two radii connecting the sphere's center to each of the two points. So, if I can figure out the minimum angular distance between any two centers, I can set that to be greater than 2r.But how do I arrange six points on a sphere such that the minimum angular distance between any two points is maximized? That sounds like a sphere packing problem or maybe related to the concept of spherical codes. I think this is similar to placing points on a sphere so that they are as far apart as possible. For six points, I believe the optimal arrangement is the vertices of a regular octahedron. Let me verify that.A regular octahedron has six vertices, each of which is equidistant from its neighbors. So, if I place the centers of the six circles at the vertices of a regular octahedron inscribed in the unit sphere, the angular distance between any two centers would be the same. That seems promising because it would mean that each circle is equally spaced from its neighbors, which should give the maximum possible radius without overlapping.So, let's figure out the angular distance between two adjacent vertices of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron can be thought of as two square pyramids glued together at their square bases. Each vertex is at the same distance from the center of the sphere, which is 1 in this case.To find the angular distance between two adjacent vertices, I can consider the dot product of the position vectors of two adjacent vertices. The dot product formula is:[mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} = |mathbf{a}||mathbf{b}| cos theta]Since both vectors are unit vectors (because the sphere has radius 1), this simplifies to:[mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} = cos theta]So, if I can find the dot product between two adjacent vertices, I can find the angle θ between them, which is the angular distance.Let me recall the coordinates of a regular octahedron. One possible set of coordinates for a regular octahedron centered at the origin is:- (1, 0, 0)- (-1, 0, 0)- (0, 1, 0)- (0, -1, 0)- (0, 0, 1)- (0, 0, -1)Wait, actually, no. That's a cube, isn't it? No, wait, that's actually the vertices of a cube. Hmm, maybe I confused the two. Let me think again.A regular octahedron has vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), and (0, 0, ±1). So, yes, those are the vertices. So, each vertex is along one of the coordinate axes, either positive or negative. So, for example, one vertex is (1, 0, 0), another is (-1, 0, 0), and so on.Now, let's take two adjacent vertices. For example, (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0). What's the angle between these two vectors? Let's compute their dot product.The dot product is (1)(0) + (0)(1) + (0)(0) = 0. So, the dot product is 0, which means the angle between them is 90 degrees or π/2 radians. Wait, that can't be right because in a regular octahedron, adjacent vertices should be closer than 90 degrees apart.Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the adjacency. In a regular octahedron, each vertex is connected to four others, right? So, for the vertex (1, 0, 0), it should be connected to (0, 1, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, 1), and (0, 0, -1). So, actually, those are all adjacent vertices. So, the angle between (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0) is 90 degrees, as we saw.But wait, in a regular octahedron, the edges are all the same length, but the angle between adjacent vertices is 90 degrees? That seems a bit counterintuitive because I thought the regular octahedron is dual to the cube, which has 90-degree angles between edges.Wait, perhaps I need to think about the edge length. The edge length of the octahedron can be calculated from the coordinates. Let's compute the distance between (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0). The distance is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt[1 + 1] = sqrt(2). So, each edge has length sqrt(2). But since the sphere is a unit sphere, the chord length between two points is 2*sin(θ/2), where θ is the angular distance.So, chord length c = 2*sin(θ/2). We have c = sqrt(2), so:sqrt(2) = 2*sin(θ/2)Divide both sides by 2:sqrt(2)/2 = sin(θ/2)Which is sin(θ/2) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071So, θ/2 = π/4, so θ = π/2. So, the angular distance between two adjacent vertices is indeed 90 degrees or π/2 radians. So, that checks out.But wait, if the angular distance between centers is π/2, then the maximum angular radius r such that the circles don't overlap would be half of that, right? Because if two circles are each of radius r, the distance between their centers needs to be at least 2r to prevent overlapping. So, in this case, 2r ≤ π/2, so r ≤ π/4.Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because on a sphere, the distance between centers is the angular distance, and the circles themselves have angular radii. So, if two circles each have angular radius r, the angular distance between their centers needs to be at least 2r to prevent overlapping. So, yes, if the centers are separated by θ, then θ ≥ 2r.In our case, θ is π/2, so 2r ≤ π/2, so r ≤ π/4. Therefore, the maximum possible radius is π/4. But wait, is that the case?Wait, let me think again. If the centers are separated by θ, then the circles will just touch each other when θ = 2r. So, to prevent overlapping, θ must be greater than 2r. So, if θ is exactly 2r, the circles are tangent, but they don't overlap. So, in our case, θ is π/2, so r can be up to π/4. So, the maximum radius is π/4.But hold on, is that the maximum? Because if we have six circles arranged at the vertices of an octahedron, each separated by π/2, then each circle can have a radius of π/4 without overlapping. But is there a way to arrange the circles with a larger radius without overlapping?Alternatively, maybe arranging the circles in a different configuration allows for a larger radius. For example, if we arrange them in a different polyhedron, like a cube, which has eight vertices, but we only need six circles. Wait, but a cube has six faces, so maybe arranging the centers at the centers of the faces of a cube inscribed in the sphere.Wait, that might be another way to think about it. So, if we place the centers of the six circles at the centers of the faces of a cube inscribed in the unit sphere, then the angular distance between centers would be different.Let me compute that. The centers of the faces of a cube are at (±a, 0, 0), (0, ±a, 0), (0, 0, ±a), where a is the distance from the center to the face center. Since the cube is inscribed in the unit sphere, the distance from the center to each vertex is 1. So, for a cube with edge length s, the space diagonal is s√3. So, s√3 = 2 (since the sphere has diameter 2). Therefore, s = 2/√3.The distance from the center to a face center is half the edge length, so a = s/2 = (2/√3)/2 = 1/√3. Therefore, the position vectors of the face centers are (±1/√3, 0, 0), etc. So, the angular distance between two adjacent face centers can be calculated.Take two adjacent face centers, say (1/√3, 0, 0) and (0, 1/√3, 0). The dot product is (1/√3)(0) + (0)(1/√3) + (0)(0) = 0. So, the angle between them is 90 degrees, same as before. So, in this case, the angular distance between centers is still π/2, so the maximum radius would still be π/4.Wait, so whether I arrange the centers at the vertices of an octahedron or at the face centers of a cube, the angular distance between centers is the same, π/2, so the maximum radius is π/4. So, maybe that's the maximum possible.But wait, is there a way to arrange six circles with a larger radius? Maybe if we don't use a regular octahedron or cube configuration.Alternatively, perhaps arranging the centers in a different symmetric configuration, like the vertices of a triangular prism or something else.Wait, another thought: the problem is similar to placing six non-overlapping circles on a sphere, each as large as possible. I recall that in some cases, using the vertices of a Platonic solid gives the optimal configuration, but I'm not sure.Wait, actually, for six points on a sphere, the regular octahedron is the configuration that maximizes the minimal distance between points. So, that should give the maximum possible minimal angular distance, which in turn allows the maximum possible radius for the circles.So, if the minimal angular distance between centers is π/2, then the maximum radius is π/4.But let me verify this with another approach. Let's consider the area of the sphere. The total surface area of a unit sphere is 4π. Each circle has an area of 2π(1 - cos r), where r is the angular radius. So, the area of one circle is 2π(1 - cos r). For six circles, the total area would be 12π(1 - cos r). But since the circles don't overlap, the total area must be less than or equal to 4π.So, 12π(1 - cos r) ≤ 4π.Divide both sides by π:12(1 - cos r) ≤ 4Divide both sides by 12:1 - cos r ≤ 1/3So, cos r ≥ 2/3Therefore, r ≤ arccos(2/3)Wait, arccos(2/3) is approximately 0.8411 radians, which is about 48.19 degrees. But earlier, I thought the radius was π/4, which is approximately 0.7854 radians or 45 degrees. So, this suggests that the radius could be larger than π/4.Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?Wait, the area approach gives a higher possible radius, but the geometric arrangement with the octahedron gives a lower radius. So, which one is the limiting factor?I think the area is a necessary condition but not necessarily sufficient. That is, the area condition gives a lower bound on the maximum possible radius, but the actual maximum could be lower due to geometric constraints.So, in this case, the area condition suggests that the radius could be up to arccos(2/3), but the geometric arrangement only allows up to π/4. So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me double-check.The area of a spherical cap (which is what a circle on a sphere is) is indeed 2π(1 - cos r), where r is the angular radius. So, for six circles, the total area would be 12π(1 - cos r). Since the circles don't overlap, the total area should be less than or equal to 4π.So, 12π(1 - cos r) ≤ 4πDivide both sides by π:12(1 - cos r) ≤ 4Divide both sides by 12:1 - cos r ≤ 1/3So, cos r ≥ 2/3Therefore, r ≤ arccos(2/3) ≈ 0.8411 radians.But wait, if the circles are arranged in such a way that they don't overlap, but perhaps they can be arranged more efficiently than the octahedron configuration, allowing for a larger radius.But is that possible? Because the octahedron configuration is symmetric and maximizes the minimal distance between centers, which would suggest that any other configuration would have at least one pair of centers closer together, which would require a smaller radius to prevent overlapping.So, perhaps the area condition is not tight, and the actual maximum radius is indeed π/4.But wait, let's think differently. Maybe the circles can be arranged in a way that they are not all mutually tangent, but some are further apart, allowing others to have a larger radius.Wait, but in the octahedron arrangement, all circles are equally spaced, so they are all tangent to each other. If we allow some circles to be further apart, perhaps others can have a larger radius. But then, the minimal distance between centers would still limit the maximum radius.Wait, no, because if some centers are further apart, others might be closer, which would require a smaller radius to prevent overlapping. So, the minimal distance between any two centers is still the limiting factor.Therefore, the maximum radius is determined by the minimal angular distance between any two centers. So, if we can arrange the six centers such that the minimal angular distance is as large as possible, then the radius can be as large as half of that.So, in the octahedron arrangement, the minimal angular distance is π/2, so radius is π/4. But is there a way to arrange six points on a sphere with a larger minimal angular distance?I don't think so. The regular octahedron is the configuration that maximizes the minimal distance between six points on a sphere. So, that should be the optimal arrangement.Therefore, the maximum radius is π/4.But wait, let's check the area again. If the radius is π/4, then the area of each circle is 2π(1 - cos(π/4)).Compute cos(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.So, 1 - √2/2 ≈ 1 - 0.7071 ≈ 0.2929.So, the area of each circle is 2π * 0.2929 ≈ 0.5858π.Six circles would have a total area of 6 * 0.5858π ≈ 3.5148π.But the total surface area of the sphere is 4π, so 3.5148π is less than 4π, which is fine. So, the area condition is satisfied.But earlier, the area condition suggested that the radius could be up to arccos(2/3) ≈ 0.8411 radians, which is larger than π/4 ≈ 0.7854 radians.So, why is there a discrepancy? Because the area condition is a necessary condition but not sufficient. It tells us that the radius cannot be larger than arccos(2/3), but in reality, due to the geometric constraints of arranging six circles on a sphere, the maximum possible radius is actually π/4.Wait, but if the area condition allows for a larger radius, why can't we arrange the circles in a way that allows for a larger radius without overlapping?Maybe because the area condition is too optimistic. It assumes that the circles can be arranged without overlapping, but in reality, the geometry of the sphere imposes stricter limitations.Alternatively, perhaps the area condition is not the right approach here because it doesn't account for the curvature of the sphere and the way circles can overlap in non-trivial ways.Wait, another thought: perhaps the circles can be arranged in a way that some of them are further apart, allowing others to have a larger radius. But in reality, all circles must be the same size, so the minimal distance between any two centers is still the limiting factor.Therefore, regardless of how you arrange the circles, the minimal angular distance between any two centers will determine the maximum radius. So, if the minimal angular distance is π/2, then the radius is π/4.But wait, let me think about another configuration. What if instead of arranging the centers at the vertices of an octahedron, we arrange them in a different way where the minimal angular distance is larger than π/2?Is that possible? For six points on a sphere, can we have a minimal angular distance larger than π/2?I don't think so. Because in the octahedron configuration, each point is as far apart as possible from its neighbors. Any other configuration would have at least two points closer together.Wait, actually, let me recall that for six points on a sphere, the regular octahedron is the configuration that maximizes the minimal distance between any two points. So, that should be the optimal arrangement.Therefore, the minimal angular distance is π/2, so the maximum radius is π/4.But wait, let me check the area again. If the radius is π/4, the total area is about 3.5148π, which is less than 4π. So, there is still some unused area on the sphere. That suggests that maybe the radius could be increased a bit more without overlapping.But how? Because if I increase the radius beyond π/4, the circles would start overlapping because the angular distance between centers is π/2, which is exactly twice the radius. So, if the radius is π/4, the circles are just tangent to each other. If I increase the radius beyond that, they would overlap.Wait, but the area condition suggests that the total area could be up to 4π, so maybe the circles can be arranged in a way that they are not all mutually tangent, but some are further apart, allowing others to have a larger radius. But since all circles must be equal, the minimal distance between any two centers still limits the maximum radius.Wait, perhaps I'm conflating two different concepts: the area covered by the circles and the geometric arrangement. The area condition is a necessary condition, but the geometric arrangement is a stricter condition.So, in reality, the maximum radius is determined by the minimal angular distance between centers, which is π/2 in the octahedron configuration, leading to a radius of π/4.But let me try to compute the area for radius π/4 and see if it's possible to arrange the circles without overlapping.As I calculated earlier, each circle has an area of approximately 0.5858π, so six circles have a total area of approximately 3.5148π, which is less than 4π. So, in theory, there is enough area on the sphere to fit six circles of radius π/4 without overlapping.But wait, just because the total area is less than the sphere's surface area doesn't necessarily mean that the circles can be arranged without overlapping. It's a necessary condition, but not sufficient. So, the area condition is satisfied, but the geometric arrangement must also be considered.In the octahedron arrangement, the circles are arranged such that each is tangent to four others. So, in that case, the circles are just touching, not overlapping. So, that should be the maximum possible radius.Therefore, I think the maximum radius is π/4.But wait, let me check another source or perhaps think about the kissing number on a sphere. The kissing number in three dimensions is 12, which is the number of spheres that can touch another sphere without overlapping. But in our case, we're dealing with circles on a sphere, so it's a bit different.Wait, but in our case, each circle is like a cap on the sphere, and we want six such caps that don't overlap. So, maybe the concept is similar to spherical codes, where you want to place points on a sphere such that the minimal distance between any two points is maximized.In our case, we have six points, and the minimal angular distance is π/2, so the maximum radius is π/4.Alternatively, perhaps I can use some trigonometry to calculate the radius.Imagine two circles on the sphere, each with angular radius r, centered at points A and B, separated by an angular distance θ. The circles will overlap if the angular distance between A and B is less than 2r. So, to prevent overlapping, θ must be at least 2r.In the octahedron arrangement, θ is π/2, so 2r ≤ π/2, so r ≤ π/4.Therefore, the maximum radius is π/4.But wait, let me think about the area again. If the radius is π/4, the area per circle is 2π(1 - cos(π/4)) ≈ 2π(1 - 0.7071) ≈ 2π(0.2929) ≈ 0.5858π. Six circles would be about 3.5148π, which is less than 4π. So, in theory, there is still room on the sphere.But perhaps the circles can be arranged in a way that allows for a larger radius without overlapping, even though the minimal angular distance is π/2.Wait, no, because if the minimal angular distance is π/2, then the maximum radius is π/4, regardless of the area. Because if you have two circles with centers separated by π/2, each with radius greater than π/4, they would overlap.So, the area condition is just a rough estimate, but the geometric constraint is more precise.Therefore, I think the maximum possible radius is π/4.But wait, let me check another way. If I have six circles arranged at the vertices of an octahedron, each circle has radius π/4, and they are just tangent to each other. So, that seems to be the maximum.Alternatively, if I use a different polyhedron, like a triangular bipyramid or something else, but I don't think that would give a larger minimal angular distance.Wait, another thought: the regular octahedron is dual to the cube, so maybe arranging the centers at the face centers of a cube, which is another way to get six points on a sphere, but as I calculated earlier, the angular distance between centers is still π/2, so the radius is still π/4.Therefore, regardless of the configuration, as long as the minimal angular distance is π/2, the maximum radius is π/4.So, I think I've convinced myself that the maximum possible radius is π/4.But just to make sure, let me think about the actual geometry. If I have two circles on a sphere, each with radius π/4, and their centers are π/2 apart, then the circles will just touch each other at one point. So, they don't overlap, which is good.If I try to make the radius any larger, say π/4 + ε, then the circles would overlap because the distance between centers is only π/2, which is less than 2*(π/4 + ε) = π/2 + 2ε. So, they would overlap by 2ε.Therefore, π/4 is indeed the maximum radius.So, after all this thinking, I believe the maximum possible radius is π/4.**Final Answer**The maximum possible radius of these circles is boxed{dfrac{pi}{4}}."},{"question":"For how many integers x is the point (x, -x) inside or on the circle of radius 10 centered at (5, 5)?textbf{(A) }11qquad textbf{(B) }12qquad textbf{(C) }13qquad textbf{(D) }14qquad textbf{(E) }15","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find how many integers x make the point (x, -x) lie inside or on a circle of radius 10 centered at (5, 5). The options are from A to E, with numbers 11 to 15. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2. So, in this case, the circle is centered at (5, 5) with radius 10. That means the equation is (x - 5)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 100. But the point we're interested in is (x, -x). So, I can substitute y with -x in the circle's equation. That should give me an inequality because the point has to be inside or on the circle. So, substituting, we get:(x - 5)^2 + (-x - 5)^2 ≤ 100Okay, now I need to simplify this inequality to find the range of x values that satisfy it. Let me expand both terms.First, (x - 5)^2 is x^2 - 10x + 25. Then, (-x - 5)^2 is the same as (x + 5)^2 because squaring a negative is the same as squaring the positive. So, (x + 5)^2 is x^2 + 10x + 25.Adding these two together:(x^2 - 10x + 25) + (x^2 + 10x + 25) ≤ 100Let me combine like terms. The x^2 terms: x^2 + x^2 is 2x^2. The x terms: -10x + 10x cancel out, so that's 0. The constants: 25 + 25 is 50.So, the inequality simplifies to:2x^2 + 50 ≤ 100Subtract 50 from both sides:2x^2 ≤ 50Divide both sides by 2:x^2 ≤ 25Okay, so x^2 is less than or equal to 25. That means x is between -5 and 5, inclusive, right? Because the square of any number between -5 and 5 is less than or equal to 25.Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check. If x is an integer, then the integers from -5 to 5 inclusive are: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That's 11 integers. Hmm, but the options go up to 15, and 11 is an option (A). But wait, maybe I made a mistake in my substitution or simplification.Let me go back through the steps. The point is (x, -x). The circle is centered at (5,5) with radius 10. So, the distance from (x, -x) to (5,5) should be less than or equal to 10.The distance formula is sqrt[(x - 5)^2 + (-x - 5)^2] ≤ 10. Squaring both sides, we get (x - 5)^2 + (-x - 5)^2 ≤ 100. That's what I did earlier.Expanding (x - 5)^2: x^2 -10x +25. Expanding (-x -5)^2: x^2 +10x +25. Adding them: 2x^2 +50 ≤100. So, 2x^2 ≤50, x^2 ≤25. So, x is between -5 and 5 inclusive. So, integers from -5 to 5, which is 11 integers.But wait, the answer choices start at 11, so 11 is an option. But the options go up to 15, so maybe I missed something.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check again. The point is (x, -x). So, substituting into the circle equation: (x - 5)^2 + (-x -5)^2 ≤100.Wait, maybe I should compute (-x -5)^2 correctly. Let me compute that again. (-x -5)^2 is equal to [(-1)(x +5)]^2, which is (x +5)^2, which is x^2 +10x +25. So, that seems correct.So, adding (x -5)^2 and (-x -5)^2: (x^2 -10x +25) + (x^2 +10x +25) = 2x^2 +50. So, 2x^2 +50 ≤100, so 2x^2 ≤50, x^2 ≤25. So, x is between -5 and 5 inclusive.So, that gives 11 integer values: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, 11 integers. So, the answer should be 11, which is option A.But wait, the options are A)11, B)12, C)13, D)14, E)15. So, 11 is an option, but I feel like maybe I missed some points. Maybe the circle is larger, so maybe x can be beyond -5 and 5? Wait, let me think.Wait, the radius is 10, so the circle is quite large. The center is at (5,5). The point (x, -x) lies on the line y = -x, which is a diagonal line. So, the distance from the center (5,5) to the line y = -x might be less than 10, so maybe some points beyond -5 and 5 could still lie inside the circle.Wait, maybe I was too quick to conclude that x is between -5 and 5. Let me think again.Wait, when I substituted, I got x^2 ≤25, so x is between -5 and 5. But perhaps that's not the case because the point (x, -x) is not just any point, but it's constrained to lie on the line y = -x. So, maybe the maximum x is more than 5 or less than -5.Wait, perhaps I should visualize this. The circle is centered at (5,5) with radius 10. The line y = -x passes through the origin and goes into the second and fourth quadrants. The center (5,5) is in the first quadrant. So, the distance from the center to the line y = -x is important here.Wait, maybe I should calculate the distance from the center (5,5) to the line y = -x. The formula for the distance from a point (h,k) to the line ax + by + c =0 is |ah + bk + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So, the line y = -x can be written as x + y = 0, so a=1, b=1, c=0.So, the distance is |1*5 + 1*5 + 0| / sqrt(1 + 1) = |10| / sqrt(2) = 10 / sqrt(2) ≈7.07.Since the radius is 10, which is larger than this distance, the line y = -x intersects the circle at two points. So, the points (x, -x) that lie inside or on the circle would be between these two intersection points.So, perhaps my initial conclusion that x is between -5 and 5 is incorrect because the line intersects the circle beyond x=5 and x=-5.Wait, so maybe I need to solve for x where (x, -x) lies on the circle, and then find the integer x's between those two points.So, let's set up the equation again:(x -5)^2 + (-x -5)^2 = 100.Wait, I did this earlier and got x^2 ≤25, but maybe I should solve for equality to find the exact points where (x, -x) is on the circle.Wait, so let's solve (x -5)^2 + (-x -5)^2 = 100.Expanding:(x^2 -10x +25) + (x^2 +10x +25) = 100So, 2x^2 +50 =1002x^2 =50x^2=25x=±5Wait, so that means the points where (x, -x) lies on the circle are at x=5 and x=-5. So, that's consistent with my earlier result.But wait, that seems contradictory to the earlier thought that the distance from the center to the line is about 7.07, which is less than the radius 10, so the line should intersect the circle at two points beyond x=5 and x=-5.Wait, but according to the equation, when x=5, y=-5, so the point is (5, -5). Similarly, when x=-5, y=5, so the point is (-5,5). Let me check if these points are on the circle.For (5, -5):Distance from (5,5) is sqrt[(5-5)^2 + (-5 -5)^2] = sqrt[0 + (-10)^2] = sqrt[100] =10. So, yes, (5, -5) is on the circle.Similarly, (-5,5):Distance from (5,5) is sqrt[(-5 -5)^2 + (5 -5)^2] = sqrt[(-10)^2 +0] =10. So, yes, (-5,5) is on the circle.Wait, so that means the line y=-x intersects the circle exactly at (5, -5) and (-5,5). So, the points (x, -x) on the circle are at x=5 and x=-5.Therefore, the points (x, -x) inside the circle would be those where x is between -5 and 5, inclusive. So, that gives 11 integer values, as I thought earlier.But then why did I think earlier that maybe x could be beyond 5 or -5? Maybe because I was confusing the distance from the center to the line with the actual intersection points. But in reality, the line y=-x intersects the circle exactly at x=5 and x=-5, so those are the boundary points.Therefore, the integer x's are from -5 to 5, inclusive, which is 11 integers. So, the answer should be 11, which is option A.Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should plug in x=6 and see if the point (6, -6) is inside the circle.Compute the distance from (6, -6) to (5,5):sqrt[(6-5)^2 + (-6 -5)^2] = sqrt[1 + (-11)^2] = sqrt[1 + 121] = sqrt[122] ≈11.045, which is greater than 10. So, (6, -6) is outside the circle.Similarly, x=-6: point (-6,6). Distance to (5,5):sqrt[(-6 -5)^2 + (6 -5)^2] = sqrt[(-11)^2 +1] = sqrt[121 +1] = sqrt[122] ≈11.045, which is also outside.So, indeed, x=6 and x=-6 are outside the circle. So, the maximum x is 5 and the minimum is -5.Therefore, the integers x are from -5 to 5, inclusive, which is 11 integers.Wait, but let me count them again to be sure: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That's 11 numbers. So, 11 is the correct answer.But wait, the options include 12, 13, etc. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check the equation again.The point is (x, -x). So, substituting into the circle equation:(x -5)^2 + (-x -5)^2 ≤100.Wait, let me compute this for x=5: (5-5)^2 + (-5 -5)^2 =0 + (-10)^2=100, which is on the circle.For x=4: (4-5)^2 + (-4 -5)^2 = (-1)^2 + (-9)^2=1 +81=82 ≤100, which is inside.Similarly, x=-5: (-5 -5)^2 + (5 -5)^2= (-10)^2 +0=100, on the circle.x=-4: (-4 -5)^2 + (4 -5)^2= (-9)^2 + (-1)^2=81 +1=82 ≤100, inside.So, x from -5 to 5 inclusive are all inside or on the circle.Wait, but maybe I should check x=5.5 or something, but since x has to be integer, 5.5 isn't considered.Wait, but perhaps the circle is large enough that the line y=-x passes through more integer points inside the circle beyond x=5 and x=-5, but as we saw, x=6 and x=-6 are outside.Wait, let me check x=5: (5, -5) is on the circle. x=4: inside. x=5 is the maximum x where the point is on the circle.Similarly, x=-5 is the minimum x where the point is on the circle.So, I think 11 is correct.Wait, but the answer choices are A)11, B)12, C)13, D)14, E)15.Hmm, so 11 is an option, but maybe I'm missing some points. Let me think again.Wait, maybe I should consider that the point (x, -x) could be inside the circle even if x is beyond 5 or -5, but as we saw, x=6 and x=-6 are outside. So, no.Wait, perhaps I should consider that the circle is centered at (5,5), so maybe the points where x is larger than 5 could still be inside if y is adjusted, but in this case, y is fixed as -x. So, if x increases beyond 5, y becomes more negative, which might take the point further away from the center.Similarly, if x is less than -5, y becomes positive, but again, the distance might increase.Wait, let me compute for x=5: (5, -5) is on the circle.x=6: (6, -6) is outside.x=4: (4, -4) is inside.Similarly, x=-5: (-5,5) is on the circle.x=-6: (-6,6) is outside.x=-4: (-4,4) is inside.So, yeah, only from -5 to 5.Wait, but maybe I should check x=5 and x=-5 again. Are they included? Yes, because the problem says \\"inside or on\\" the circle.So, x=5 and x=-5 are included, so that's 11 integers.Wait, but let me think again: when I solved (x -5)^2 + (-x -5)^2 ≤100, I got x^2 ≤25, so x between -5 and 5 inclusive. So, that's 11 integers.Wait, but maybe I should check for x=5 and x=-5 again. Let me compute the distance for x=5: (5, -5). Distance to (5,5) is sqrt[(0)^2 + (-10)^2] =10, which is on the circle.Similarly, x=-5: (-5,5). Distance to (5,5) is sqrt[(-10)^2 +0] =10, on the circle.So, yes, both are on the circle, so included.Therefore, the number of integer x's is 11.Wait, but the answer choices include 11 as option A, so that's the answer.Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I should list all the integer x's and count them.x can be: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.That's 11 integers.Yes, so I think the answer is 11, which is option A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"If two different square roots of a positive number are a+3 and 2a-6, then the positive number is:A: 1B: 4C: 9D: 16","answer":"To determine the positive number, I start by recognizing that the two given square roots, ( a + 3 ) and ( 2a - 6 ), must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign because square roots of a positive number are negatives of each other.So, I set up the equation:[a + 3 = -(2a - 6)]Next, I solve for ( a ):[a + 3 = -2a + 6][3a = 3][a = 1]With ( a = 1 ), I substitute back to find the square roots:[a + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4][2a - 6 = 2(1) - 6 = -4]Finally, squaring one of the square roots gives the positive number:[4^2 = 16]"},{"question":"The set of solutions of the equation log_{10}left( a^2-15aright)=2 consists oftextbf{(A)} text{two integers } qquadtextbf{(B)} text{one integer and one fraction}qquad textbf{(C)} text{two irrational numbers }qquadtextbf{(D)} text{two non-real numbers} qquadtextbf{(E)} text{no numbers, that is, the empty set}","answer":"First, I'll start by rewriting the logarithmic equation in its exponential form.

Find the radius of the circle.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a sector AOB with radius R and a 90-degree angle. Inside this sector, there's a circle inscribed that touches the segments OA, OB, and the arc AB. I need to find the radius of this inscribed circle. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.First, a sector with a 90-degree angle is like a quarter-circle, right? So, if I imagine a circle with radius R, and then I take a quarter of it, that's the sector AOB. Now, inside this sector, there's another circle that's touching both radii OA and OB, as well as the arc AB. So, this inscribed circle is tangent to both sides of the sector and also tangent to the outer arc.I think drawing a diagram might help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. The sector is like a pizza slice, and the inscribed circle is snugly fitting inside, touching the two crust edges and the outer edge of the pizza slice.Let me denote the radius of the inscribed circle as r. So, I need to find r in terms of R.Since the sector is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians, the two radii OA and OB are perpendicular to each other. The inscribed circle touches both OA and OB, so its center must be equidistant from both OA and OB. Because OA and OB are perpendicular, the center of the inscribed circle should lie along the angle bisector of the sector, which in this case is the line that splits the 90-degree angle into two 45-degree angles.So, the center of the inscribed circle is somewhere along this bisector. Let's denote the center as point C. The distance from point C to both OA and OB is equal to r, since the circle is tangent to these sides.Now, the circle is also tangent to the arc AB of the sector. The arc AB is part of the original circle with radius R. So, the distance from the center of the sector O to the center of the inscribed circle C must be equal to R - r, because the two circles are tangent to each other. That is, the distance between their centers is equal to the difference in their radii.Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If two circles are tangent externally, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii. If they are tangent internally, like in this case where the inscribed circle is inside the sector's circle, then the distance between centers is the difference of their radii. So yes, OC = R - r.But hold on, the center C is not on the arc AB, but inside the sector. So, the distance from O to C is R - r. But also, since C is along the bisector, which is at 45 degrees from OA and OB, the coordinates of C can be represented in polar coordinates as (R - r, 45 degrees). Or in Cartesian coordinates, it would be ((R - r)cos45°, (R - r)sin45°).But maybe I can approach this problem using coordinate geometry. Let me place the sector in a coordinate system with point O at the origin, OA along the x-axis, and OB along the y-axis. So, the sector is in the first quadrant, spanning from (R, 0) to (0, R).The inscribed circle touches both the x-axis and y-axis, so its center must be at (r, r). Because the distance from the center to both axes is equal to the radius r. So, the center is at (r, r).Now, the inscribed circle is also tangent to the arc AB, which is the quarter-circle of radius R centered at O. The equation of this arc AB is x² + y² = R². The inscribed circle has the equation (x - r)² + (y - r)² = r².Since these two circles are tangent to each other, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii. In this case, since the inscribed circle is inside the sector's circle, it's internally tangent, so the distance between centers is R - r.The center of the sector's circle is at (0, 0), and the center of the inscribed circle is at (r, r). So, the distance between them is sqrt[(r - 0)² + (r - 0)²] = sqrt(r² + r²) = sqrt(2r²) = r*sqrt(2).But we also know that this distance should be equal to R - r. So, we have:r*sqrt(2) = R - rNow, let's solve for r.Bring the r from the right side to the left:r*sqrt(2) + r = RFactor out r:r(sqrt(2) + 1) = RTherefore,r = R / (sqrt(2) + 1)Hmm, that seems correct, but I remember sometimes when dealing with denominators, it's better to rationalize them. So, let's rationalize the denominator:Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(2) - 1):r = [R * (sqrt(2) - 1)] / [(sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1)]Simplify the denominator:(sqrt(2) + 1)(sqrt(2) - 1) = (sqrt(2))² - (1)² = 2 - 1 = 1So, the denominator is 1, which simplifies things:r = R * (sqrt(2) - 1)So, the radius of the inscribed circle is R multiplied by (sqrt(2) - 1). That makes sense because sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so sqrt(2) - 1 is about 0.414, which is less than 1, so the inscribed circle is smaller than the original sector's radius, which is expected.Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I placed the sector in a coordinate system with O at the origin, OA along x-axis, OB along y-axis.2. The inscribed circle touches both axes, so its center is at (r, r).3. The distance from O to C is sqrt(r² + r²) = r*sqrt(2).4. Since the circles are tangent internally, this distance is R - r.5. So, r*sqrt(2) = R - r.6. Solving gives r = R / (sqrt(2) + 1) = R*(sqrt(2) - 1).Yes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the reasoning.Alternatively, I can think about this problem using trigonometry. Since the sector is 90 degrees, the angle bisector is at 45 degrees. The center of the inscribed circle lies along this bisector at a distance of R - r from O.In the triangle formed by O, C, and the projection of C onto OA, which is (r, 0), we have a right triangle with legs of length r and r, hypotenuse OC = R - r.So, using Pythagoras:r² + r² = (R - r)²Which simplifies to:2r² = R² - 2Rr + r²Subtract r² from both sides:r² = R² - 2RrBring all terms to one side:r² + 2Rr - R² = 0This is a quadratic equation in terms of r:r² + 2Rr - R² = 0We can solve this using the quadratic formula:r = [-2R ± sqrt((2R)² - 4*1*(-R²))]/(2*1)Simplify inside the square root:sqrt(4R² + 4R²) = sqrt(8R²) = 2R*sqrt(2)So,r = [-2R ± 2R*sqrt(2)] / 2Factor out 2R:r = [2R(-1 ± sqrt(2))]/2 = R(-1 ± sqrt(2))Since radius can't be negative, we take the positive solution:r = R(-1 + sqrt(2)) = R(sqrt(2) - 1)So, same result as before. That's reassuring.I think I've approached this problem from two different angles: coordinate geometry and trigonometry, both leading to the same answer. So, I feel confident that the radius of the inscribed circle is R multiplied by (sqrt(2) - 1).Just to recap, the key steps were:1. Recognizing that the center of the inscribed circle lies along the angle bisector of the sector.2. Determining the coordinates of the center based on the radius r.3. Calculating the distance from the origin to the center, which equals R - r.4. Setting up the equation based on the distance formula and solving for r.5. Verifying the result using an alternative method to ensure correctness.So, I think I've got it. The radius is R times (sqrt(2) minus one).**Final Answer**The radius of the inscribed circle is boxed{R(sqrt{2} - 1)}."},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = x + frac{a}{x}, and f(1) = 5.(1) Find the value of a;(2) Determine the parity of the function f(x);(3) Discuss the monotonicity of the function f(x) on the interval (2, +infty) and prove your conclusion using the definition.","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = x + a/x, and I know that f(1) = 5. I need to find the value of a, determine the parity of the function, and discuss its monotonicity on the interval (2, +∞) using the definition. Hmm, let's take it step by step.Starting with part (1): Find the value of a.Alright, f(1) = 5. So, if I plug x = 1 into the function, I should get 5. Let's do that:f(1) = 1 + a/1 = 1 + a.And this equals 5. So, 1 + a = 5. Solving for a, subtract 1 from both sides:a = 5 - 1 = 4.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, a is 4. Let me double-check: f(1) = 1 + 4/1 = 5. Yep, that works. So, part (1) is done, a = 4.Moving on to part (2): Determine the parity of the function f(x).Parity refers to whether a function is even, odd, or neither. Remember, an even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain, and an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain.So, let's compute f(-x) and see.Given f(x) = x + a/x, so f(-x) = (-x) + a/(-x) = -x - a/x.Compare this to f(x) and -f(x):f(x) = x + a/x-f(x) = -x - a/xSo, f(-x) = -x - a/x, which is exactly equal to -f(x). Therefore, f(-x) = -f(x), which means the function is odd.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. If a is 4, then f(x) = x + 4/x. So, f(-x) = -x + 4/(-x) = -x - 4/x, which is indeed -f(x). So, yes, it's odd. So, the function is odd.But wait, is that always the case regardless of a? Let me think. If a were different, say, a = 0, then f(x) = x, which is odd. If a is non-zero, then f(x) = x + a/x. Then f(-x) = -x - a/x, which is -f(x). So, regardless of a, as long as a is a constant, this function is odd. So, yeah, part (2) is that f(x) is odd.Now, part (3): Discuss the monotonicity of f(x) on the interval (2, +∞) and prove it using the definition.Monotonicity refers to whether the function is increasing or decreasing on that interval. To determine this, I can use calculus, but since the problem specifies to use the definition, I should probably use the definition of increasing or decreasing functions.But wait, the definition usually involves comparing f(x2) and f(x1) for x2 > x1. So, if f(x2) > f(x1) whenever x2 > x1, then it's increasing; if f(x2) < f(x1), then it's decreasing.Alternatively, another way is to use the derivative. But since the problem says to use the definition, I think they mean the first principle, not the derivative.But let me recall: The definition of a function being increasing on an interval is that for any two points x1 and x2 in the interval with x1 < x2, we have f(x1) ≤ f(x2). If it's strictly increasing, then f(x1) < f(x2). Similarly for decreasing.So, let's try to use this definition.Given f(x) = x + 4/x, and we need to check its behavior on (2, +∞).Let me pick two arbitrary points x1 and x2 in (2, +∞) with x1 < x2. I need to show that f(x2) - f(x1) > 0, which would mean it's increasing.Compute f(x2) - f(x1):f(x2) - f(x1) = (x2 + 4/x2) - (x1 + 4/x1) = (x2 - x1) + 4(1/x2 - 1/x1).Simplify 1/x2 - 1/x1:1/x2 - 1/x1 = (x1 - x2)/(x1 x2).So, f(x2) - f(x1) = (x2 - x1) + 4*(x1 - x2)/(x1 x2).Factor out (x2 - x1):= (x2 - x1)[1 - 4/(x1 x2)].So, f(x2) - f(x1) = (x2 - x1)[1 - 4/(x1 x2)].Now, since x2 > x1, x2 - x1 > 0.So, the sign of f(x2) - f(x1) depends on the second factor: [1 - 4/(x1 x2)].We need to determine whether this is positive or negative.Given that x1 and x2 are both in (2, +∞), so x1 > 2 and x2 > 2. Therefore, x1 x2 > 4.So, 4/(x1 x2) < 4/4 = 1.Therefore, 1 - 4/(x1 x2) > 0.So, both factors (x2 - x1) and [1 - 4/(x1 x2)] are positive. Therefore, f(x2) - f(x1) > 0.Hence, f(x) is strictly increasing on (2, +∞).Wait, let me verify this with an example. Let's pick x1 = 3 and x2 = 4.f(3) = 3 + 4/3 ≈ 3 + 1.333 ≈ 4.333f(4) = 4 + 4/4 = 4 + 1 = 5So, f(4) - f(3) ≈ 5 - 4.333 ≈ 0.666 > 0. So, it's increasing.Another example: x1 = 2.5, x2 = 3.f(2.5) = 2.5 + 4/2.5 = 2.5 + 1.6 = 4.1f(3) = 3 + 4/3 ≈ 4.333So, f(3) - f(2.5) ≈ 0.233 > 0. Still increasing.Wait, what if x1 and x2 are both greater than 2 but closer to 2? Let's say x1 = 2.1, x2 = 2.2.Compute f(2.1) = 2.1 + 4/2.1 ≈ 2.1 + 1.9048 ≈ 4.0048f(2.2) = 2.2 + 4/2.2 ≈ 2.2 + 1.8182 ≈ 4.0182So, f(2.2) - f(2.1) ≈ 0.0134 > 0. Still increasing, but the difference is smaller.So, seems consistent.Alternatively, if I use the derivative approach, which might be quicker, but since the problem asks for the definition, I should stick with the previous method.But just for my understanding, let's compute the derivative:f(x) = x + 4/xf'(x) = 1 - 4/x²On the interval (2, +∞), x > 2, so x² > 4, so 4/x² < 1, so f'(x) = 1 - 4/x² > 0.Therefore, f'(x) > 0 on (2, +∞), so f is increasing.But since the problem says to use the definition, I think the first method is sufficient.So, summarizing:1. a = 42. The function is odd.3. The function is strictly increasing on (2, +∞).I think that covers all parts. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning.For part (1), plugging in x=1 gives 1 + a = 5, so a=4. That seems solid.For part (2), f(-x) = -x -4/x = - (x + 4/x) = -f(x). So, yes, it's odd.For part (3), using the definition, I showed that f(x2) - f(x1) is positive when x2 > x1 in (2, +∞), so the function is increasing. The derivative approach also confirms this, but since the problem asked for the definition, I think my initial proof is acceptable.Yeah, I think that's all correct.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{4}(2) The function is boxed{text{odd}}.(3) The function is boxed{text{increasing}} on the interval (2, +infty)."},{"question":"Gavril sat in an electric train with a fully charged smartphone, and by the end of the trip his smartphone was completely discharged.

What distance did Gavril travel if the train moved at an average speed of 80 km/h for half the distance and at an average speed of 60 km/h for the other half? Give the answer in kilometers, rounding to the nearest whole number if necessary.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Gavril was on an electric train with a fully charged smartphone, and by the end of the trip, his phone was completely discharged. He spent half of the time playing Tetris and the other half watching cartoons. It's given that the smartphone fully discharges in 3 hours of video watching or in 5 hours of playing Tetris. I need to find the distance Gavril traveled, considering the train moved at an average speed of 80 km/h for half the distance and 60 km/h for the other half. The answer should be in kilometers, rounded to the nearest whole number if necessary.Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to figure out how long the trip took because the phone's discharge time depends on how he used it. Then, using the time, I can relate it to the distance traveled by the train.So, let's start with the phone's discharge. The phone discharges completely in 3 hours of video watching or 5 hours of playing Tetris. Gavril spent half the time playing Tetris and half the time watching cartoons. Let me denote the total time of the trip as T hours. Therefore, he spent T/2 hours playing Tetris and T/2 hours watching cartoons.Now, I need to calculate the total discharge caused by both activities. Since watching videos discharges the phone faster than playing Tetris, each activity contributes differently to the discharge. Let's find out how much discharge each activity causes per hour.If the phone fully discharges in 3 hours of video watching, then the discharge rate for video watching is 1/3 per hour. Similarly, for playing Tetris, since it takes 5 hours to discharge fully, the discharge rate is 1/5 per hour.So, during the trip, the total discharge from video watching is (T/2) * (1/3) and from Tetris is (T/2) * (1/5). Since the phone was completely discharged by the end of the trip, the sum of these two should equal 1 (a full discharge). Therefore, the equation is:(T/2)*(1/3) + (T/2)*(1/5) = 1Let me compute that:First, factor out T/2:(T/2)*(1/3 + 1/5) = 1Compute 1/3 + 1/5. To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 15.1/3 = 5/15 and 1/5 = 3/15, so together it's 8/15.So, (T/2)*(8/15) = 1Multiply both sides by 2:T*(8/15) = 2Then, solve for T:T = 2 * (15/8) = 30/8 = 15/4 = 3.75 hours.So, the total trip time T is 3.75 hours.Now, moving on to the train's journey. The train traveled half the distance at 80 km/h and the other half at 60 km/h. I need to find the total distance. Let's denote the total distance as D. Therefore, half the distance is D/2, and the other half is also D/2.The time taken to travel each half can be calculated using the formula:Time = Distance / SpeedSo, time for the first half: (D/2) / 80 = D/(2*80) = D/160 hours.Time for the second half: (D/2) / 60 = D/(2*60) = D/120 hours.Total time T is the sum of these two times:T = D/160 + D/120We already found that T is 3.75 hours, so:D/160 + D/120 = 3.75To solve for D, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are 160 and 120. The least common multiple (LCM) of 160 and 120. Let's see:160 factors: 2^5 * 5120 factors: 2^3 * 3 * 5So, LCM is 2^5 * 3 * 5 = 32 * 3 * 5 = 480.So, common denominator is 480.Convert each fraction:D/160 = (3D)/480D/120 = (4D)/480So, adding them together:(3D + 4D)/480 = 7D/480Set equal to 3.75:7D/480 = 3.75Solve for D:Multiply both sides by 480:7D = 3.75 * 480Calculate 3.75 * 480:3.75 is equal to 15/4, so 15/4 * 480 = (15 * 480)/4 = (15 * 120) = 1800So, 7D = 1800Therefore, D = 1800 / 7Compute that:1800 divided by 7 is approximately 257.142857...So, approximately 257.142857 kilometers.Rounding to the nearest whole number, since 0.142857 is less than 0.5, we round down.So, D ≈ 257 km.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, the phone discharge part:He used half the time on each activity. So, T/2 on video and T/2 on Tetris.Discharge rates:Video: 1/3 per hourTetris: 1/5 per hourTotal discharge: (T/2)(1/3) + (T/2)(1/5) = T/6 + T/10 = (5T + 3T)/30 = 8T/30 = 4T/15Set equal to 1: 4T/15 = 1 => T = 15/4 = 3.75 hours. That seems correct.Then, for the train:Total time is 3.75 hours.Distance D, half at 80 km/h, half at 60 km/h.Time for first half: (D/2)/80 = D/160Time for second half: (D/2)/60 = D/120Total time: D/160 + D/120 = (3D + 4D)/480 = 7D/480 = 3.75So, 7D = 3.75 * 480 = 1800Thus, D = 1800 / 7 ≈ 257.142857Yes, that seems correct.So, the distance is approximately 257.14 km, which rounds to 257 km.Wait, but 0.142857 is approximately 1/7, which is about 0.142857. So, 257.142857 is 257 and 1/7 km. Since 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, which is less than 0.5, so we round down to 257 km.Therefore, the answer is 257 km.But just to make sure, let me compute 1800 divided by 7 more accurately.7 goes into 18 two times (14), remainder 4.Bring down the 0: 40.7 goes into 40 five times (35), remainder 5.Bring down the 0: 50.7 goes into 50 seven times (49), remainder 1.Bring down the 0: 10.7 goes into 10 once (7), remainder 3.Bring down the 0: 30.7 goes into 30 four times (28), remainder 2.Bring down the 0: 20.7 goes into 20 two times (14), remainder 6.Bring down the 0: 60.7 goes into 60 eight times (56), remainder 4.Bring down the 0: 40.Wait, we've seen this before. It's starting to repeat.So, 1800 / 7 is 257.142857142857..., repeating every six digits: 142857.So, 257.142857... km. So, 257.142857 km is approximately 257.14 km, which is still 257 km when rounded to the nearest whole number.Therefore, the distance Gavril traveled is 257 kilometers.**Final Answer**The distance Gavril traveled is boxed{257} kilometers."},{"question":"If the complex number z=a^2-a-2+(a+1)i is purely imaginary, then the value of the real number a is boxed{2}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If the complex number ( z = a^2 - a - 2 + (a + 1)i ) is purely imaginary, then the value of the real number ( a ) is ( boxed{2} ). Hmm, I need to figure out why that's the case. Let me think through this step by step.First, I remember that a complex number is generally written as ( z = x + yi ), where ( x ) is the real part and ( y ) is the imaginary part. The problem says that ( z ) is purely imaginary. From what I recall, a purely imaginary number has no real part, meaning the real part ( x ) must be zero. So, for ( z ) to be purely imaginary, the real part of ( z ) should be zero.Looking at the given complex number ( z = a^2 - a - 2 + (a + 1)i ), the real part is ( a^2 - a - 2 ) and the imaginary part is ( (a + 1) ). Since ( z ) is purely imaginary, the real part must equal zero. Therefore, I can set up the equation:( a^2 - a - 2 = 0 )Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation for ( a ). Let me write it down again:( a^2 - a - 2 = 0 )I can try factoring this quadratic. To factor ( a^2 - a - 2 ), I need two numbers that multiply to -2 and add up to -1. Let me think: factors of -2 are (1, -2) and (-1, 2). Let's test these:1 and -2: 1 + (-2) = -1. Perfect, that's the coefficient of the middle term.So, the quadratic factors as:( (a + 1)(a - 2) = 0 )Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:1. ( a + 1 = 0 ) => ( a = -1 )2. ( a - 2 = 0 ) => ( a = 2 )So, the solutions are ( a = -1 ) and ( a = 2 ). Wait, but the answer given is 2. Why isn't -1 a valid solution?Hold on, maybe I need to check if both solutions are valid in the context of the problem. The problem mentions that ( z ) is purely imaginary, which means the real part is zero, but the imaginary part must be non-zero. If the imaginary part were zero, then ( z ) would be zero, which is technically a real number as well as purely imaginary, but sometimes problems specify that purely imaginary numbers must have a non-zero imaginary part.Let me check the imaginary part for both solutions:1. When ( a = -1 ):   The imaginary part is ( a + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0 ).   So, ( z = 0 + 0i = 0 ). Hmm, is zero considered purely imaginary? I think it's a matter of definition. In some contexts, zero is considered purely imaginary because it can be written as ( 0i ), but in other contexts, purely imaginary numbers are required to have a non-zero imaginary part. I need to check if the problem has any specific definition.2. When ( a = 2 ):   The imaginary part is ( a + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ).   So, ( z = 0 + 3i ), which is clearly purely imaginary with a non-zero imaginary part.Since the problem states that ( z ) is purely imaginary, and if we consider that purely imaginary numbers must have a non-zero imaginary part, then ( a = -1 ) would make ( z = 0 ), which is not purely imaginary in that stricter sense. Therefore, the only valid solution is ( a = 2 ).Alternatively, if the problem allows zero as a purely imaginary number, then both ( a = -1 ) and ( a = 2 ) would be solutions. But since the answer provided is 2, it's likely that the problem expects ( z ) to have a non-zero imaginary part. Therefore, ( a = 2 ) is the correct answer.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The real part is set to zero, which gives two solutions. However, one of those solutions makes the imaginary part zero, which might not be acceptable depending on the definition. Since the answer is given as 2, that must be the case here.So, the value of ( a ) is indeed 2.**Final Answer**The value of the real number ( a ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Given Xsim N(mu, sigma^{2}), if P(Xleq 0) = P(Xgeq 2), then mu = ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where X follows a normal distribution with mean μ and variance σ². The problem says that the probability that X is less than or equal to 0 is equal to the probability that X is greater than or equal to 2. I need to find μ. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a normal distribution, the probabilities can be transformed into Z-scores using the formula Z = (X - μ)/σ. This standardizes the variable so that we can use standard normal distribution tables or properties.Given that P(X ≤ 0) = P(X ≥ 2), I can write this as:P(X ≤ 0) = P(X ≥ 2)Since the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, if these two probabilities are equal, it suggests that 0 and 2 are equidistant from the mean μ. So, μ should be exactly halfway between 0 and 2. That would make sense because if the distribution is symmetric, the points equidistant from the mean would have equal probabilities on either side.Let me test this idea. If μ is the midpoint between 0 and 2, then μ = (0 + 2)/2 = 1. So, μ should be 1. But wait, let me verify this with the Z-scores to make sure.Let's convert both X=0 and X=2 into Z-scores. For X=0:Z1 = (0 - μ)/σAnd for X=2:Z2 = (2 - μ)/σSince P(X ≤ 0) = P(X ≥ 2), this implies that the area to the left of Z1 is equal to the area to the right of Z2. In terms of the standard normal distribution, this means:Φ(Z1) = 1 - Φ(Z2)Where Φ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the standard normal variable.But since the normal distribution is symmetric, if Φ(Z1) = 1 - Φ(Z2), then Z2 must be equal to -Z1. Because the area to the left of Z1 is the same as the area to the right of -Z1. So, Z2 = -Z1.Let me write that down:Z2 = -Z1Substituting the expressions for Z1 and Z2:(2 - μ)/σ = - (0 - μ)/σSimplify the right side:(2 - μ)/σ = - (-μ)/σ = μ/σSo, we have:(2 - μ)/σ = μ/σSince σ is positive and non-zero, we can multiply both sides by σ to eliminate the denominator:2 - μ = μNow, solving for μ:2 = μ + μ2 = 2μμ = 1Okay, so that confirms my initial thought. The mean μ is 1. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes.We started with the given probabilities being equal, converted them into Z-scores, used the symmetry of the normal distribution to set up an equation, solved for μ, and got 1. It all checks out.I don't think I made any errors here. The key was recognizing the symmetry and translating the given probabilities into a relationship between the Z-scores. That led me to the equation that solved for μ. Yeah, I feel confident that μ is indeed 1.**Final Answer**The value of μ is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given that the function f(x) is an even function defined on mathbb{R} with the smallest positive period of 2, and f(x) = x when 0 leqslant x leqslant 1, find the value of f(-1) + f(-2017) = _____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a function f(x) that's even, defined on all real numbers, and it has the smallest positive period of 2. Also, when x is between 0 and 1, inclusive, f(x) is just equal to x. I need to find f(-1) + f(-2017). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let's recall what it means for a function to be even. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain. So, if I can find f at a positive value, I can easily find it at the corresponding negative value by just using the same value. That should help with f(-1) and f(-2017).Next, the function has a period of 2, which means that f(x + 2) = f(x) for all x. The smallest positive period is 2, so we don't have a smaller period than that. That tells me that the function repeats every 2 units. So, if I can figure out the value of f at some point, I can find the value at any other point by adding or subtracting multiples of 2 until I get into the interval where I know the function's definition.We know that f(x) = x when 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. So, for x between 0 and 1, the function is just the identity function. But what about for x between 1 and 2? Since the function is periodic with period 2, I can figure that out by considering the behavior on the interval [0, 2). Wait, but we only know it on [0,1]. Hmm, maybe I need to use the fact that the function is even to figure out what happens on [1,2].Let me think. Since the function is even, f(-x) = f(x). So, for x in [-1, 0], f(x) = f(-x) = -x, because when x is in [0,1], f(x) = x. So, for x in [-1,0], f(x) = -x, which is the same as |x|, right? So, on the interval [-1,1], the function is f(x) = |x|.But wait, the function is also periodic with period 2. So, to define f on the entire real line, we can take the function defined on [-1,1] and repeat it every 2 units. So, for any x, f(x) is equal to f(x + 2k) where k is an integer such that x + 2k falls into the interval [-1,1]. Alternatively, we can express x as x = 2k + r, where r is in [-1,1), and then f(x) = |r|.Wait, let me test this idea. If x is in [1,2], then x - 2 is in [-1,0]. So, f(x) = f(x - 2) because of the periodicity. But f(x - 2) is in [-1,0], so f(x - 2) = -(x - 2) because of the evenness. Therefore, f(x) = -(x - 2) = 2 - x for x in [1,2]. So, on [1,2], f(x) = 2 - x.Similarly, for x in [2,3], f(x) = f(x - 2) which is in [0,1], so f(x) = x - 2. For x in [3,4], f(x) = f(x - 2) which is in [1,2], so f(x) = 2 - (x - 2) = 4 - x. Hmm, so it seems like the function alternates between increasing and decreasing on each interval of length 1.Wait, but actually, since the period is 2, the function on [0,2] is defined as f(x) = x on [0,1] and f(x) = 2 - x on [1,2]. Then, it repeats every 2 units. So, for any x, f(x) can be found by taking x modulo 2, but adjusted to fit into the interval [-1,1] because of the evenness.But maybe it's easier to think of it as f(x) = |x - 2k| where k is chosen such that x - 2k is in [-1,1]. Hmm, not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, since the function is even, we can just consider x in [0,1], and then mirror it to [-1,0], and then repeat every 2 units.Wait, maybe I should graph the function mentally. From x = 0 to x = 1, it's a straight line from (0,0) to (1,1). Then, from x = 1 to x = 2, it's a straight line from (1,1) to (2,0). Then, from x = 2 to x = 3, it's a straight line from (2,0) to (3,1), and so on. Similarly, on the negative side, from x = -1 to x = 0, it's a straight line from (-1,1) to (0,0), and from x = -2 to x = -1, it's a straight line from (-2,0) to (-1,1). So, it's a triangle wave that goes up and down every 1 unit, but with period 2.Wait, but actually, since the period is 2, the function repeats every 2 units, so from x = 0 to x = 2, it's a triangle wave going up to 1 at x =1 and back down to 0 at x=2. Then, from x=2 to x=4, it repeats, going up to 1 at x=3 and back down to 0 at x=4, etc. Similarly, on the negative side, it's mirrored.So, with that in mind, let's try to compute f(-1) and f(-2017).First, f(-1). Since the function is even, f(-1) = f(1). From the definition, f(1) is 1, because on [0,1], f(x) = x. So, f(-1) = 1.Now, f(-2017). Hmm, that's a bit trickier. Let's see. Since the function is periodic with period 2, f(-2017) = f(-2017 + 2k) where k is an integer such that -2017 + 2k falls into the interval where we know the function's definition, say [-1,1].But since 2017 is a large number, let's compute how many periods are in 2017. Since each period is 2, 2017 divided by 2 is 1008.5. So, 2017 = 2*1008 + 1. So, 2017 is 1008 full periods plus 1. Therefore, f(-2017) = f(-2017 + 2*1008) = f(-2017 + 2016) = f(-1). So, f(-2017) = f(-1) = 1.Wait, hold on. Let me verify that. If I have f(-2017), since the function is periodic with period 2, adding or subtracting multiples of 2 won't change the value. So, f(-2017) = f(-2017 + 2*1009) because 2*1009 = 2018, so f(-2017 + 2018) = f(1). So, f(-2017) = f(1) = 1.Wait, so which is it? Is it f(-1) or f(1)? Let me think. Since f is even, f(-2017) = f(2017). Then, f(2017) = f(2017 mod 2). 2017 divided by 2 is 1008 with a remainder of 1, so 2017 mod 2 is 1. Therefore, f(2017) = f(1) = 1. So, f(-2017) = 1.Wait, so both f(-1) and f(-2017) equal 1? So, f(-1) + f(-2017) = 1 + 1 = 2.But let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the periodicity.So, f is periodic with period 2, so f(x + 2) = f(x) for all x. So, f(-2017) = f(-2017 + 2k) for any integer k. Let's choose k such that -2017 + 2k is in the interval [0,2), which is the fundamental period.So, let's compute -2017 mod 2. Since -2017 divided by 2 is -1008.5, so the remainder is 1, because -2017 = (-1009)*2 + 1. So, -2017 mod 2 is 1. Therefore, f(-2017) = f(1) = 1.Similarly, f(-1) = f(1) because f is even, and f(1) = 1. So, both f(-1) and f(-2017) are 1, so their sum is 2.Wait, but let me think again about the definition of the function. On [0,1], f(x) = x, and on [1,2], it's 2 - x. So, f(1) is 1, which is consistent.But what about f(-1)? Since f is even, f(-1) = f(1) = 1. So, yes, that's correct.Alternatively, if I think about the graph, at x = -1, the function should have the same value as at x = 1, which is 1. So, that seems right.So, putting it all together, f(-1) + f(-2017) = 1 + 1 = 2.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure that the function is correctly defined on the negative side. Since it's even, f(-x) = f(x). So, for x in [-1,0], f(x) = f(-x) = -x, as I thought earlier. So, at x = -1, f(-1) = f(1) = 1. So, that's consistent.And for x = -2017, since it's periodic with period 2, we can add 2 repeatedly until we get into the interval [0,2). So, -2017 + 2018 = 1, so f(-2017) = f(1) = 1.Therefore, the sum is 2.I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 2.**Final Answer**boxed{2}"},{"question":"Determine the value of cos left( -frac{11pi}{6} right) + sin frac{11pi}{3}.","answer":"To determine the value of ( cos left( -frac{11pi}{6} right) + sin frac{11pi}{3} ), I'll start by simplifying each trigonometric function individually.For the cosine term, ( cos left( -frac{11pi}{6} right) ), I know that cosine is an even function, so ( cos(-theta) = cos(theta) ). This means ( cos left( -frac{11pi}{6} right) = cos left( frac{11pi}{6} right) ).Next, I'll find an equivalent angle for ( frac{11pi}{6} ) within the first rotation by subtracting ( 2pi ). This gives ( frac{11pi}{6} - 2pi = frac{11pi}{6} - frac{12pi}{6} = -frac{pi}{6} ). However, since cosine has a period of ( 2pi ), ( cos left( -frac{pi}{6} right) = cos left( frac{pi}{6} right) ). The value of ( cos left( frac{pi}{6} right) ) is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).Moving on to the sine term, ( sin frac{11pi}{3} ), I'll find an equivalent angle within the first rotation by subtracting multiples of ( 2pi ). Subtracting ( 2pi ) three times gives ( frac{11pi}{3} - 6pi = frac{11pi}{3} - frac{18pi}{3} = -frac{7pi}{3} ). Adding ( 2pi ) to this angle results in ( -frac{7pi}{3} + 2pi = -frac{7pi}{3} + frac{6pi}{3} = -frac{pi}{3} ). Since sine has a period of ( 2pi ), ( sin left( -frac{pi}{3} right) = -sin left( frac{pi}{3} right) ). The value of ( sin left( frac{pi}{3} right) ) is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), so ( sin left( -frac{pi}{3} right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ).Finally, I'll add the two results together: ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + left( -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) = 0 )."},{"question":"Given that the coefficient of the term x^{3} in the expansion of the binomial ({x^2}+frac{a}{x})^6 is 160, find the value of the real number a.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of the real number ( a ) such that the coefficient of the term ( x^3 ) in the expansion of the binomial ( left( x^2 + frac{a}{x} right)^6 ) is 160. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when expanding a binomial like ( (A + B)^n ), each term in the expansion is given by the binomial theorem, which is ( binom{n}{k} A^{n - k} B^k ) for ( k = 0 ) to ( n ). So, in this case, ( A ) is ( x^2 ) and ( B ) is ( frac{a}{x} ), and ( n ) is 6.So, each term in the expansion will be ( binom{6}{k} (x^2)^{6 - k} left( frac{a}{x} right)^k ). I need to find the term where the power of ( x ) is 3 because the coefficient of ( x^3 ) is given as 160.Let me write that term out:( binom{6}{k} (x^2)^{6 - k} left( frac{a}{x} right)^k ).Simplify the exponents:First, ( (x^2)^{6 - k} ) is ( x^{2(6 - k)} = x^{12 - 2k} ).Then, ( left( frac{a}{x} right)^k ) is ( a^k cdot x^{-k} ).So, multiplying these together, the exponent of ( x ) becomes ( 12 - 2k - k = 12 - 3k ).We need the exponent to be 3, so set up the equation:( 12 - 3k = 3 ).Solve for ( k ):Subtract 12 from both sides:( -3k = 3 - 12 )( -3k = -9 )Divide both sides by -3:( k = 3 ).Okay, so the term where ( k = 3 ) will have the exponent ( x^3 ). Now, let's find the coefficient of that term.The coefficient is ( binom{6}{3} times (x^2)^{6 - 3} times left( frac{a}{x} right)^3 ), but we can ignore the ( x ) part since we already found the exponent. So, focusing on the numerical coefficient:( binom{6}{3} times (1)^{3} times a^3 ).Wait, actually, ( (x^2)^{3} ) is just ( x^6 ), but since we're looking for the coefficient, we can consider the constants. So, the coefficient is ( binom{6}{3} times a^3 ).Compute ( binom{6}{3} ):( binom{6}{3} = frac{6!}{3! cdot (6 - 3)!} = frac{720}{6 cdot 6} = frac{720}{36} = 20 ).So, the coefficient is ( 20 times a^3 ).But the problem states that this coefficient is 160. So, set up the equation:( 20a^3 = 160 ).Solve for ( a ):Divide both sides by 20:( a^3 = frac{160}{20} = 8 ).So, ( a^3 = 8 ). To find ( a ), take the cube root of both sides:( a = sqrt[3]{8} = 2 ).Wait, but hold on. Since ( a ) is a real number, and cube roots of real numbers are unique, so ( a = 2 ) is the only real solution.Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Applied the binomial theorem correctly: Yes, each term is ( binom{6}{k} (x^2)^{6 - k} left( frac{a}{x} right)^k ).2. Simplified the exponents: ( 12 - 3k ). Set equal to 3, solved for ( k = 3 ). That seems correct.3. Calculated the coefficient: ( binom{6}{3} = 20 ). That's right.4. Set ( 20a^3 = 160 ), so ( a^3 = 8 ), so ( a = 2 ). Yep, that all checks out.I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward once I break it down step by step.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"How many numbers can you get by multiplying two or more distinct members of the set {1,2,3,5,11} together?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out how many different numbers I can get by multiplying two or more distinct members of the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 11}. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. I have a set of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 11. I need to multiply two or more distinct numbers from this set together and find out how many unique products I can get. So, for example, multiplying 2 and 3 gives me 6, and that's one number. Then, multiplying 2 and 5 gives me 10, which is another number. I need to do this for all possible combinations of two or more numbers and count how many unique results there are.Alright, so the first step is to figure out all the possible combinations of two or more numbers from the set. Since the set has 5 elements, the number of possible combinations can be calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of elements, and k is the number of elements we're choosing each time.So, for k = 2, 3, 4, and 5, I can calculate the number of combinations:- C(5, 2) = 10- C(5, 3) = 10- C(5, 4) = 5- C(5, 5) = 1Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 26. So, there are 26 possible products if I consider all combinations of two or more numbers. But wait, the question is asking for how many unique numbers I can get. That means some of these products might be the same, so I can't just say 26. I need to actually compute each product and see if any duplicates occur.Hmm, okay, so maybe I should list all the possible products. Let me start by listing all the combinations and their products.First, let's list all the combinations of two numbers:1. 1 and 2: 1*2 = 22. 1 and 3: 1*3 = 33. 1 and 5: 1*5 = 54. 1 and 11: 1*11 = 115. 2 and 3: 2*3 = 66. 2 and 5: 2*5 = 107. 2 and 11: 2*11 = 228. 3 and 5: 3*5 = 159. 3 and 11: 3*11 = 3310. 5 and 11: 5*11 = 55So, the two-number products are: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 33, 55. That's 10 products, all unique so far.Next, let's move on to combinations of three numbers:1. 1, 2, 3: 1*2*3 = 62. 1, 2, 5: 1*2*5 = 103. 1, 2, 11: 1*2*11 = 224. 1, 3, 5: 1*3*5 = 155. 1, 3, 11: 1*3*11 = 336. 1, 5, 11: 1*5*11 = 557. 2, 3, 5: 2*3*5 = 308. 2, 3, 11: 2*3*11 = 669. 2, 5, 11: 2*5*11 = 11010. 3, 5, 11: 3*5*11 = 165Looking at these products: 6, 10, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165.Wait a minute, 6, 10, 15, 22, 33, 55 are already in the two-number products. So, these are duplicates. The new unique products from three-number combinations are 30, 66, 110, 165. So, that's 4 new unique numbers.So, now, our unique products so far are: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165. That's 14 unique numbers.Moving on to combinations of four numbers:1. 1, 2, 3, 5: 1*2*3*5 = 302. 1, 2, 3, 11: 1*2*3*11 = 663. 1, 2, 5, 11: 1*2*5*11 = 1104. 1, 3, 5, 11: 1*3*5*11 = 1655. 2, 3, 5, 11: 2*3*5*11 = 330Calculating these products: 30, 66, 110, 165, 330.Looking at these, 30, 66, 110, 165 were already obtained from the three-number combinations. So, the only new unique product here is 330.Adding that to our list, we now have: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165, 330. That's 15 unique numbers.Finally, the combination of all five numbers:1. 1, 2, 3, 5, 11: 1*2*3*5*11 = 330Wait, that's the same as the four-number combination. So, 330 is already in our list. Therefore, no new unique product here.So, compiling all the unique products we have:From two-number combinations: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 33, 55.From three-number combinations: 30, 66, 110, 165.From four-number combinations: 330.And the five-number combination didn't add anything new.So, let's count them:1. 22. 33. 54. 65. 106. 117. 158. 229. 3010. 3311. 5512. 6613. 11014. 16515. 330So, that's 15 unique products.Wait, but hold on a second. I think I might have missed something. Let me double-check the three-number combinations. When I multiplied 1, 2, 3, I got 6, which was already in the two-number products. Similarly, 1, 2, 5 gave me 10, which was also a duplicate. So, only 30, 66, 110, 165 were new. That seems correct.Similarly, for four-number combinations, 30, 66, 110, 165 were duplicates, and only 330 was new. So, that's correct.But let me make sure I didn't miss any combinations or miscalculate any products.Starting with two-number combinations:1. 1*2=22. 1*3=33. 1*5=54. 1*11=115. 2*3=66. 2*5=107. 2*11=228. 3*5=159. 3*11=3310. 5*11=55Yes, all correct. 10 products, all unique.Three-number combinations:1. 1*2*3=6 (duplicate)2. 1*2*5=10 (duplicate)3. 1*2*11=22 (duplicate)4. 1*3*5=15 (duplicate)5. 1*3*11=33 (duplicate)6. 1*5*11=55 (duplicate)7. 2*3*5=30 (new)8. 2*3*11=66 (new)9. 2*5*11=110 (new)10. 3*5*11=165 (new)Yes, so 4 new products here.Four-number combinations:1. 1*2*3*5=30 (duplicate)2. 1*2*3*11=66 (duplicate)3. 1*2*5*11=110 (duplicate)4. 1*3*5*11=165 (duplicate)5. 2*3*5*11=330 (new)So, only 1 new product here.Five-number combination:1. 1*2*3*5*11=330 (duplicate)So, no new product.Therefore, in total, unique products are 10 (from two-number) + 4 (from three-number) + 1 (from four-number) = 15.Wait, but hold on. I think I might have missed some products when considering the three-number combinations. Let me check again.Wait, for three-number combinations, 2*3*5=30, which is unique. 2*3*11=66, unique. 2*5*11=110, unique. 3*5*11=165, unique. So, yes, 4 new products.Similarly, for four-number combinations, only 330 is new.So, total unique products: 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.But wait, let me list all the products again to make sure:From two-number:2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 33, 55.From three-number:30, 66, 110, 165.From four-number:330.So, listing them all:2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165, 330.That's 15 numbers. So, 15 unique products.Wait, but hold on. I just realized that 1 is in the set. When I multiply 1 with any other number, it just gives the number itself. But in the problem statement, it says \\"multiplying two or more distinct members\\". So, does that include 1? Because if I include 1, then multiplying 1 with another number gives that number, but since 1 is already in the set, does that affect the count?Wait, in the two-number combinations, when I multiplied 1 with another number, I got 2, 3, 5, 11. But these are the same as the numbers themselves. However, in the original set, we have 1, 2, 3, 5, 11. So, when we multiply 1 with another number, we get the number itself, but since we are considering products of two or more numbers, does that mean that 2, 3, 5, 11 are already in the set, but are they considered as products?Wait, the problem says \\"multiplying two or more distinct members\\". So, the products are numbers obtained by multiplying two or more distinct members. So, for example, 2 is a member of the set, but it can also be obtained by multiplying 1 and 2. However, since 1 is also a member, does that mean 2 is being counted twice? Or is 2 considered as a product?Wait, no. The problem is asking for how many numbers can you get by multiplying two or more distinct members. So, if 2 can be obtained by multiplying 1 and 2, which are two distinct members, then 2 is a valid product. Similarly, 3 can be obtained by multiplying 1 and 3, so 3 is also a valid product. Same with 5 and 11.But wait, in the original set, 1 is also a member. So, if I multiply 1 with another number, I get that number. But since 1 is part of the set, does that mean that all the numbers in the set can be obtained by multiplying 1 with another number? So, does that mean that all the numbers in the set are included in the products?Wait, but the problem is asking for products of two or more distinct members. So, if I take 1 and 2, that's two distinct members, so 2 is a product. Similarly, 1 and 3 gives 3, which is also a product. But 2 is already in the set, but it's also a product of two numbers. So, does that mean that 2 is being counted twice? Or is it just considered once?Wait, no. The problem is asking for how many unique numbers you can get. So, even if 2 is obtained both as a single number and as a product of 1 and 2, it's still just one number. But in our case, we are only considering products of two or more numbers. So, 2 is obtained by multiplying 1 and 2, which are two distinct members. So, 2 is a valid product. Similarly, 3, 5, and 11 are also valid products because they can be obtained by multiplying 1 with themselves.But wait, hold on. If I consider 2 as a product of 1 and 2, but 2 is also a member of the set. So, does that mean that 2 is being counted as both a member and a product? But the problem is asking for numbers obtained by multiplying two or more distinct members. So, 2 is a product, and it's also a member, but in the context of the problem, we are only considering the products, regardless of whether they are in the original set or not.Wait, but the original set includes 1, 2, 3, 5, 11. So, when we multiply 1 and 2, we get 2, which is already in the set. But the problem is asking for numbers obtained by multiplying two or more distinct members. So, 2 is a valid product, even though it's in the original set. So, in our count, 2, 3, 5, 11 are included as products because they can be obtained by multiplying 1 with another number.But wait, in our initial calculation, we included 2, 3, 5, 11 as products from two-number combinations. So, that seems correct.But now, let me think about whether 1 can be used in products. For example, if I multiply 1, 2, and 3, I get 6, which is a product. But 1 is being used here as well. So, 1 is a member, but it's also being used in products. So, as long as we are multiplying two or more distinct members, including 1, it's fine.But wait, another thought: when we multiply 1 with another number, we get that number. So, for example, 1*2=2, which is the same as the number 2. So, does that mean that 2 is being counted as a product, but it's also a member. So, in the context of the problem, are we supposed to count numbers that are in the original set if they can be obtained by multiplying two or more members?Wait, the problem says: \\"How many numbers can you get by multiplying two or more distinct members of the set {1,2,3,5,11} together?\\"So, the numbers are obtained by multiplying two or more distinct members. So, even if the number is already in the set, if it can be obtained by multiplying two or more distinct members, it's counted. So, 2 can be obtained by 1*2, so it's counted. Similarly, 3 can be obtained by 1*3, so it's counted. 5 by 1*5, and 11 by 1*11.So, in our initial count, we included 2, 3, 5, 11 as products, which is correct.But wait, another angle: if we consider that 1 is a multiplicative identity, multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So, for example, 2 is 1*2, 3 is 1*3, etc. So, does that mean that all the numbers in the set except 1 can be obtained by multiplying 1 with another number? So, does that mean that all numbers except 1 are products of two or more numbers? But 1 cannot be obtained by multiplying two or more numbers because 1*1 is not allowed (they have to be distinct), and 1 multiplied by any other number gives that number, not 1.So, 1 cannot be obtained by multiplying two or more distinct members. So, in our count, 1 is not included because we can't get 1 by multiplying two or more distinct members.Therefore, in our initial count, we have 15 unique products, including 2, 3, 5, 11, which are obtained by multiplying 1 with another number.Wait, but let me think again: if I have the set {1,2,3,5,11}, and I need to multiply two or more distinct members. So, 1 is a member, but to get a product, I have to multiply it with another member. So, 1*2=2, which is a product, but 2 is also a member. So, in the context of the problem, are we supposed to count 2 as a product, even though it's a member? The problem says \\"numbers can you get by multiplying two or more distinct members\\", so yes, 2 is a product, regardless of whether it's a member or not.So, in that case, our initial count of 15 is correct.Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any products. Let me list all the possible products again:From two-number combinations:1. 1*2=22. 1*3=33. 1*5=54. 1*11=115. 2*3=66. 2*5=107. 2*11=228. 3*5=159. 3*11=3310. 5*11=55From three-number combinations:1. 1*2*3=62. 1*2*5=103. 1*2*11=224. 1*3*5=155. 1*3*11=336. 1*5*11=557. 2*3*5=308. 2*3*11=669. 2*5*11=11010. 3*5*11=165From four-number combinations:1. 1*2*3*5=302. 1*2*3*11=663. 1*2*5*11=1104. 1*3*5*11=1655. 2*3*5*11=330From five-number combination:1. 1*2*3*5*11=330So, compiling all products:From two-number: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 33, 55.From three-number: 6, 10, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165.From four-number: 30, 66, 110, 165, 330.From five-number: 330.Now, let's list all the unique products:2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165, 330.That's 15 unique numbers.Wait, but hold on. I just realized that 1 is not included in the products because you can't get 1 by multiplying two or more distinct members. So, 1 is excluded, which is correct because 1*1 is not allowed (they have to be distinct), and 1 multiplied by any other number gives that number, not 1.So, 1 is not a product in this context.Therefore, the total number of unique products is 15.But wait, let me make sure that none of the products are duplicates beyond what I've already considered. For example, is there any product that I've counted more than once beyond the duplicates I've already accounted for?Looking at the list:2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165, 330.Each of these numbers is unique. So, 15 is the correct count.Therefore, the answer is 15.But just to be thorough, let me check if any of the products from the three-number or four-number combinations could result in the same number as another combination.For example, could 2*3*5=30 and any other combination result in 30? Let's see:Looking at two-number combinations, 30 isn't there. From three-number combinations, 30 is only from 2*3*5. From four-number combinations, 30 is from 1*2*3*5, which is the same as 2*3*5. So, 30 is only counted once.Similarly, 66 is from 2*3*11 and 1*2*3*11, but it's the same product.Same with 110: from 2*5*11 and 1*2*5*11.165: from 3*5*11 and 1*3*5*11.330: from 2*3*5*11 and 1*2*3*5*11.So, all duplicates are accounted for, and each unique product is only counted once.Therefore, I can confidently say that the number of unique products is 15.**Final Answer**The number of unique products is boxed{15}."},{"question":"It takes 5 people to lift a car and twice as many people to lift a truck. How many people are needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks?","answer":"First, determine the number of people required to lift one car and one truck. It takes 5 people to lift a car, and twice as many people to lift a truck, which means it takes 10 people to lift a truck.Next, calculate the total number of people needed to lift 6 cars. Since each car requires 5 people, multiplying 5 by 6 gives 30 people.Then, calculate the total number of people needed to lift 3 trucks. Each truck requires 10 people, so multiplying 10 by 3 gives 30 people.Finally, add the number of people needed for the cars and the trucks together. Adding 30 people for the cars and 30 people for the trucks results in a total of 60 people needed to lift all 6 cars and 3 trucks."},{"question":"The cube of a number consists of five digits, the first of which is 3, and the fifth is 4.

Find the minimum value of n for which T_n geq frac{2}{n}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a sequence where the sum of the first n terms, S_n, satisfies the equation sqrt(S_n) = sqrt(S_{n-1}) + 1 for n ≥ 2, and a_1 is given as 1. There are two parts: first, find the general term a_n, and second, define b_n as 1/(a_n * a_{n+1}) and find the minimum n such that the sum T_n of the first n terms of b_n is at least 2/n.Starting with part (1). I need to find a_n. Given that sqrt(S_n) = sqrt(S_{n-1}) + 1. Hmm, this seems recursive. Maybe I can express S_n in terms of S_{n-1}.Let me square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots. So, (sqrt(S_n))^2 = (sqrt(S_{n-1}) + 1)^2. That simplifies to S_n = S_{n-1} + 2*sqrt(S_{n-1}) + 1.Wait, that's S_n = S_{n-1} + 2*sqrt(S_{n-1}) + 1. Hmm, that's a recursive formula for S_n in terms of S_{n-1}. Maybe I can find a pattern or solve this recursion.Let me define T_n = sqrt(S_n). Then the original equation becomes T_n = T_{n-1} + 1. That's much simpler! So, T_n is an arithmetic sequence where each term is 1 more than the previous term.Given that, we can write T_n = T_1 + (n - 1)*1. Since T_1 = sqrt(S_1) and S_1 is a_1, which is 1. So T_1 = sqrt(1) = 1. Therefore, T_n = 1 + (n - 1) = n.So, T_n = n, which means sqrt(S_n) = n, so S_n = n^2. That's the sum of the first n terms. So S_n = n^2.Therefore, the nth term a_n can be found by S_n - S_{n-1}. Since S_n = n^2, then a_n = n^2 - (n - 1)^2.Calculating that: n^2 - (n^2 - 2n + 1) = 2n - 1. So, a_n = 2n - 1. That seems straightforward.Let me check for n=1: a_1 should be 1. Plugging n=1 into 2n - 1 gives 1, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = 3, and S_2 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2^2, correct. Similarly, n=3: a_3 = 5, S_3 = 9, which is 3^2. So, that seems to hold.So, part (1) is done: a_n = 2n - 1.Moving on to part (2). We have b_n = 1/(a_n * a_{n+1}), and T_n is the sum of the first n terms of b_n. We need to find the minimum n such that T_n ≥ 2/n.First, let's write down b_n. Since a_n = 2n - 1, then a_{n+1} = 2(n + 1) - 1 = 2n + 1. So, b_n = 1/[(2n - 1)(2n + 1)].This looks like a telescoping series. Maybe I can use partial fractions to simplify b_n.Let me try to express b_n as A/(2n - 1) + B/(2n + 1). So,1/[(2n - 1)(2n + 1)] = A/(2n - 1) + B/(2n + 1).Multiplying both sides by (2n - 1)(2n + 1):1 = A(2n + 1) + B(2n - 1).Now, let's solve for A and B.Expanding the right-hand side: 1 = (2A + 2B)n + (A - B).Since this must hold for all n, the coefficients of n and the constant term must be equal on both sides. So,2A + 2B = 0 (coefficient of n)A - B = 1 (constant term)From the first equation: 2A + 2B = 0 => A = -B.Substitute into the second equation: (-B) - B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.Then, A = -B = 1/2.So, the partial fractions decomposition is:b_n = (1/2)/(2n - 1) - (1/2)/(2n + 1).Therefore, b_n = (1/2)[1/(2n - 1) - 1/(2n + 1)].Now, let's compute T_n, the sum of the first n terms of b_n.T_n = sum_{k=1}^n b_k = sum_{k=1}^n [ (1/2)(1/(2k - 1) - 1/(2k + 1)) ].This is a telescoping series, so let's write out the terms:For k=1: (1/2)(1/1 - 1/3)For k=2: (1/2)(1/3 - 1/5)For k=3: (1/2)(1/5 - 1/7)...For k=n: (1/2)(1/(2n - 1) - 1/(2n + 1))When we add these up, most terms will cancel out. Let's see:Sum = (1/2)[ (1 - 1/3) + (1/3 - 1/5) + (1/5 - 1/7) + ... + (1/(2n - 1) - 1/(2n + 1)) ]All the intermediate terms cancel: -1/3 cancels with +1/3, -1/5 cancels with +1/5, etc. So, we're left with:Sum = (1/2)[1 - 1/(2n + 1)].Simplify that:T_n = (1/2)[1 - 1/(2n + 1)] = (1/2)[ (2n + 1 - 1)/(2n + 1) ) ] = (1/2)(2n / (2n + 1)) = n / (2n + 1).So, T_n = n / (2n + 1).We need to find the minimum n such that T_n ≥ 2/n.So, set up the inequality:n / (2n + 1) ≥ 2 / n.Let me solve this inequality for n.Multiply both sides by n(2n + 1). Since n is a positive integer, n(2n + 1) is positive, so the inequality direction remains the same.n * n ≥ 2(2n + 1)Simplify:n² ≥ 4n + 2Bring all terms to one side:n² - 4n - 2 ≥ 0This is a quadratic inequality. Let's find the roots of the equation n² - 4n - 2 = 0.Using quadratic formula:n = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 8)] / 2 = [4 ± sqrt(24)] / 2 = [4 ± 2*sqrt(6)] / 2 = 2 ± sqrt(6).So, the roots are 2 + sqrt(6) and 2 - sqrt(6). Since sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45, 2 - sqrt(6) is negative, which we can ignore since n is a positive integer.So, the inequality n² - 4n - 2 ≥ 0 holds when n ≥ 2 + sqrt(6) ≈ 4.45.Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer n satisfying this is n=5.Wait, let me verify this. Let me compute T_n for n=4 and n=5.For n=4: T_4 = 4 / (8 + 1) = 4/9 ≈ 0.444. 2/n = 2/4 = 0.5. So, 0.444 < 0.5, so n=4 doesn't satisfy.For n=5: T_5 = 5 / (10 + 1) = 5/11 ≈ 0.4545. 2/n = 2/5 = 0.4. So, 0.4545 ≥ 0.4, which is true.Wait, but 5/11 is approximately 0.4545, which is greater than 0.4. So, n=5 satisfies the inequality.But let me check n=4: 4/9 ≈ 0.444 < 0.5, so n=4 doesn't satisfy. So, the minimal n is 5.But wait, let me double-check my algebra when solving the inequality.We had:n / (2n + 1) ≥ 2 / nCross-multiplying:n² ≥ 4n + 2Which is correct.Then, n² - 4n - 2 ≥ 0The roots are at n = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 8)] / 2 = [4 ± sqrt(24)] / 2 = 2 ± sqrt(6). So, positive root is 2 + sqrt(6) ≈ 4.45.So, n must be greater than or equal to 4.45, so the minimal integer n is 5.But let me compute T_5 and 2/5:T_5 = 5/(2*5 +1)=5/11≈0.45452/5=0.4So, 0.4545≥0.4, which is true.Similarly, for n=4:T_4=4/9≈0.44442/4=0.50.4444 < 0.5, so n=4 doesn't satisfy.Hence, the minimal n is 5.Wait, but let me check n=3:T_3=3/7≈0.42862/3≈0.66670.4286 < 0.6667, so n=3 doesn't satisfy.n=2:T_2=2/5=0.42/2=10.4 <1, so no.n=1:T_1=1/3≈0.3332/1=20.333 <2, no.So, indeed, n=5 is the minimal n where T_n≥2/n.Wait, but hold on. When I set up the inequality:n / (2n + 1) ≥ 2 / nCross-multiplying gives n² ≥ 4n + 2Which is n² -4n -2 ≥0Solutions are n ≤ 2 - sqrt(6) or n ≥ 2 + sqrt(6). Since n is positive, only n ≥ 2 + sqrt(6) ≈4.45.So, n must be at least 5.Therefore, the minimal n is 5.So, summarizing:(1) a_n = 2n -1(2) The minimal n is 5.**Final Answer**(1) The general term is boxed{2n - 1}.(2) The minimum value of ( n ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"There are six different products arranged in a row on a shelf, among which products a and b must be placed together, while products c and d cannot be placed together. The total number of different arrangements is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are six different products arranged in a row on a shelf. The conditions are that products a and b must be placed together, while products c and d cannot be placed together. I need to find the total number of different arrangements possible under these constraints.Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. First, without any constraints, the number of ways to arrange six different products would just be 6 factorial, which is 6! = 720. But since there are constraints, I need to adjust this number accordingly.The first constraint is that products a and b must be placed together. I remember that when two items must be together, we can treat them as a single unit or \\"block.\\" So instead of thinking of a and b as separate, we can consider them as one combined item. That means instead of six items, we now have five items to arrange: the ab block, and the other four products, which are c, d, e, and f.The number of ways to arrange these five items is 5! = 120. But wait, within the ab block, a and b can be arranged in two different ways: a first and then b, or b first and then a. So we need to multiply the number of arrangements by 2. That gives us 5! * 2 = 120 * 2 = 240 arrangements where a and b are together.Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the second constraint is that products c and d cannot be placed together. Hmm, so I need to subtract the number of arrangements where c and d are together from the total number of arrangements where a and b are together.But wait, I have to be careful here. Since we already treated a and b as a single block, the total number of items is five. So, when considering c and d not being together, we need to calculate how many of those 240 arrangements have c and d adjacent and subtract that number.So, let me think. If I consider c and d as another block, similar to how I treated a and b, then we would have four items to arrange: the ab block, the cd block, and the remaining two products, which are e and f.The number of ways to arrange these four items is 4! = 24. But within each block, the items can be arranged in 2 ways. So, the ab block can be ab or ba, and the cd block can be cd or dc. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where both a and b are together and c and d are together is 4! * 2 * 2 = 24 * 4 = 96.Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check. So, treating ab as a block and cd as another block, we have four blocks in total: ab, cd, e, f. The number of ways to arrange these four blocks is 4! = 24. Then, within each block, ab can be in 2 ways and cd can be in 2 ways, so 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, the total is 24 * 4 = 96. Yeah, that seems right.So, out of the 240 arrangements where a and b are together, 96 of them also have c and d together. Therefore, to find the number of arrangements where a and b are together and c and d are not together, I need to subtract these 96 from the total 240.So, 240 - 96 = 144. Therefore, the total number of different arrangements is 144.Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the initial total with a and b together is 240. Then, the number of those where c and d are also together is 96. So, subtracting gives 144. That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The total number of arrangements with a and b together is 240. The number of arrangements where a and b are together and c and d are together is 96. So, the number of arrangements where a and b are together but c and d are not together is 240 - 96 = 144. Yeah, that seems consistent.Alternatively, another way to think about it is: first, treat a and b as a single block, so we have five items: ab, c, d, e, f. The total number of arrangements is 5! * 2 = 240. Now, within these 240 arrangements, how many have c and d adjacent? To calculate that, treat c and d as another block, so now we have four items: ab, cd, e, f. The number of arrangements is 4! * 2 * 2 = 96, as before. So, subtracting gives 144.Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it using permutations where certain elements are not adjacent. So, the formula for the number of permutations where two specific elements are not adjacent is total permutations minus permutations where they are adjacent. But in this case, since a and b are already treated as a block, the total permutations are 240, and the number where c and d are adjacent is 96, so subtracting gives 144.Wait, another approach: maybe using the principle of multiplication. So, first, arrange the ab block and the other four products, but ensuring that c and d are not next to each other.But that might complicate things. Let me think. So, if I have five items: ab, c, d, e, f. I need to arrange them such that c and d are not adjacent. The total number of arrangements is 5! * 2 = 240. The number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent is 4! * 2 * 2 = 96, as before. So, subtracting gives 144.Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it as follows: treat ab as a single block, so five items. The number of ways where c and d are not adjacent is equal to the total number of arrangements minus the number where c and d are adjacent.So, total arrangements: 5! * 2 = 240.Number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent: treat c and d as a block, so four items: ab, cd, e, f. The number of arrangements is 4! * 2 (for ab) * 2 (for cd) = 24 * 4 = 96.So, subtracting: 240 - 96 = 144.Yes, that seems consistent.Wait, another thought: maybe I can calculate the number of ways where a and b are together and c and d are not together by considering the positions of c and d relative to the ab block.But that might be more complicated. Let me see.Alternatively, perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle in another way. The total number of arrangements without any constraints is 6! = 720. The number of arrangements where a and b are together is 2 * 5! = 240, as before. The number of arrangements where c and d are together is 2 * 5! = 240. But wait, that's not directly helpful because we need arrangements where a and b are together AND c and d are not together.Wait, maybe using inclusion-exclusion: the number of arrangements where a and b are together OR c and d are together is equal to the number where a and b are together plus the number where c and d are together minus the number where both a and b are together AND c and d are together.But in our case, we want the number where a and b are together AND c and d are not together. So, that would be the number where a and b are together minus the number where both a and b are together AND c and d are together.Which is exactly what we did earlier: 240 - 96 = 144.So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, let me think about it another way. Suppose we fix a and b together. So, we have the ab block, and the other four items: c, d, e, f. Now, we need to arrange these five items such that c and d are not adjacent.So, the total number of arrangements without any restrictions is 5! * 2 = 240.Now, the number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent is 4! * 2 * 2 = 96, as before.Therefore, the number of arrangements where c and d are not adjacent is 240 - 96 = 144.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, another approach: maybe using the principle of multiplication. So, first, arrange the ab block and the other four items, ensuring that c and d are not adjacent.So, treating ab as a single block, we have five items: ab, c, d, e, f.We need to arrange these five items so that c and d are not next to each other.The number of ways to arrange five items is 5! = 120. But since ab can be arranged in 2 ways, it's 120 * 2 = 240.Now, the number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent: treat c and d as a block, so four items: ab, cd, e, f. The number of arrangements is 4! = 24. Since ab can be arranged in 2 ways and cd can be arranged in 2 ways, total is 24 * 2 * 2 = 96.Therefore, the number of arrangements where c and d are not adjacent is 240 - 96 = 144.Yes, consistent again.Alternatively, maybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle for arrangements where certain elements are not adjacent. The formula is:Total arrangements - arrangements where the two elements are adjacent.But in this case, since we already have a constraint that a and b are together, we have to adjust accordingly.Wait, perhaps another way: first, fix a and b together as a block. Then, among the remaining four items, c, d, e, f, we need to arrange them such that c and d are not adjacent.So, the total number of ways to arrange the five items (ab, c, d, e, f) is 5! * 2 = 240.Now, the number of ways where c and d are adjacent is 4! * 2 * 2 = 96.So, subtracting gives 240 - 96 = 144.Yes, that's the same result.Wait, maybe I can think of it as arranging the ab block and the other four items, and then subtracting the cases where c and d are next to each other.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of linear arrangements with forbidden adjacents.In general, the number of ways to arrange n items where two specific items cannot be adjacent is n! - (n-1)! * 2.But in this case, since we have a block already, it's slightly different.Wait, let me see. So, after treating ab as a block, we have five items: ab, c, d, e, f.The number of ways to arrange these five items is 5! = 120, multiplied by 2 for the ab block, giving 240.Now, the number of ways where c and d are adjacent is calculated by treating c and d as a block, so four items: ab, cd, e, f. The number of arrangements is 4! = 24, multiplied by 2 for ab and 2 for cd, giving 96.Therefore, the number of arrangements where c and d are not adjacent is 240 - 96 = 144.Yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe using the principle of multiplication for non-adjacent arrangements.So, first, arrange the ab block and the other items, ensuring that c and d are not next to each other.The total number of positions is 5 (since ab is a block). The number of ways to arrange the five items is 5! * 2 = 240.Now, to ensure that c and d are not adjacent, we can calculate the number of ways where c and d are not next to each other.Alternatively, the number of ways where c and d are not adjacent can be calculated as:Total arrangements - arrangements where c and d are adjacent.Which is 240 - 96 = 144.Yes, same result.Wait, another thought: maybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle in a different way.Total number of arrangements with a and b together: 240.Number of arrangements with a and b together and c and d together: 96.Therefore, the number of arrangements with a and b together but c and d not together is 240 - 96 = 144.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for arrangements with two pairs: one pair must be together, another pair must not be together.But I think the approach we've taken is solid.So, to recap:1. Treat a and b as a single block. Now, we have five items: ab, c, d, e, f.2. The total number of arrangements is 5! * 2 = 240.3. Now, within these 240 arrangements, some have c and d adjacent. To find how many, treat c and d as another block, so we have four items: ab, cd, e, f.4. The number of arrangements is 4! * 2 (for ab) * 2 (for cd) = 24 * 4 = 96.5. Subtract this from the total: 240 - 96 = 144.Therefore, the total number of different arrangements is 144.Wait, just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached, maybe using permutations with restrictions.Alternatively, perhaps considering the positions of a and b first, then arranging the rest.But that might complicate things more.Alternatively, maybe using the principle of multiplication for arranging the items step by step.First, fix the ab block. There are two possibilities: ab or ba.Then, we have five positions to arrange: the ab block and c, d, e, f.Wait, no, actually, the ab block takes up two positions, so the total number of positions is still six.Wait, perhaps another approach: treating the ab block as a single entity, so we have five entities: ab, c, d, e, f.The number of ways to arrange these five entities is 5! = 120, multiplied by 2 for the ab block, giving 240.Now, within these arrangements, we need to ensure that c and d are not adjacent.So, the number of ways where c and d are adjacent is calculated by treating c and d as a block, so four entities: ab, cd, e, f.The number of arrangements is 4! = 24, multiplied by 2 for ab and 2 for cd, giving 96.Therefore, the number of arrangements where c and d are not adjacent is 240 - 96 = 144.Yes, that's consistent.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of slots. So, after placing the ab block, we have remaining slots where c, d, e, f can be placed, ensuring that c and d are not adjacent.But that might be more involved.Wait, let me try that approach.So, if we treat ab as a block, which can be placed in different positions in the six-slot shelf.The ab block can start at position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, since it occupies two positions. So, there are 5 possible positions for the ab block.Once the ab block is placed, we have four remaining slots to place c, d, e, f, with the condition that c and d are not adjacent.Wait, but the remaining slots might not all be contiguous, depending on where the ab block is placed.Hmm, this might complicate things, but let's see.For example, if the ab block is placed at positions 1 and 2, then the remaining slots are 3, 4, 5, 6.If ab is placed at positions 2 and 3, then the remaining slots are 1, 4, 5, 6.Similarly, if ab is placed at positions 3 and 4, remaining slots are 1, 2, 5, 6.If ab is placed at positions 4 and 5, remaining slots are 1, 2, 3, 6.If ab is placed at positions 5 and 6, remaining slots are 1, 2, 3, 4.So, in each case, the remaining four slots are split into two separate blocks, except when ab is at the very beginning or very end.Wait, actually, no. When ab is placed in the middle, the remaining slots are split into two separate blocks, but when ab is at the ends, the remaining slots are a single block.Wait, for example, if ab is at positions 1 and 2, the remaining slots are 3, 4, 5, 6, which is a single block of four slots.Similarly, if ab is at positions 5 and 6, the remaining slots are 1, 2, 3, 4, another single block of four slots.But when ab is placed in the middle, say positions 2 and 3, the remaining slots are 1 and 4,5,6. So, slot 1 is separate, and slots 4,5,6 are together. Similarly, if ab is at positions 3 and 4, remaining slots are 1,2 and 5,6.Wait, so in these cases, the remaining slots are split into two separate blocks.Therefore, the number of ways to arrange c, d, e, f in the remaining slots depends on whether the ab block is at the ends or in the middle.Hmm, this seems more complicated, but let's try to compute it.Case 1: ab block is at the ends (positions 1-2 or 5-6). There are 2 such positions.In each case, the remaining slots form a single block of four positions.In this single block, we need to arrange c, d, e, f such that c and d are not adjacent.Wait, but in a single block of four positions, arranging four items with c and d not adjacent.The number of ways to arrange four items where c and d are not adjacent is total arrangements minus arrangements where c and d are adjacent.Total arrangements: 4! = 24.Number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent: treat c and d as a block, so three items: cd, e, f. The number of arrangements is 3! = 6, multiplied by 2 for cd and dc, giving 12.Therefore, the number of arrangements where c and d are not adjacent is 24 - 12 = 12.So, for each end position of ab, we have 12 arrangements where c and d are not adjacent.Since there are 2 end positions, total arrangements for this case: 2 * 12 = 24.But wait, we also have to consider the ab block can be ab or ba. So, each of these 24 arrangements has 2 possibilities for ab.Therefore, total for Case 1: 24 * 2 = 48.Wait, no, actually, the 12 arrangements already account for the permutations of c, d, e, f, so the ab block's arrangement is separate.Wait, let me clarify.When ab is at the end, say positions 1-2, we have the remaining four positions as 3-6. The number of ways to arrange c, d, e, f in these four positions without c and d being adjacent is 12.But since ab can be ab or ba, each of these 12 arrangements can have 2 possibilities for ab.Therefore, total arrangements for each end position: 12 * 2 = 24.Since there are two end positions (ab at 1-2 and ab at 5-6), total arrangements for Case 1: 24 * 2 = 48.Wait, no, that might be double-counting.Wait, actually, for each end position, ab can be ab or ba, so for each end position, the number of arrangements is 12 * 2 = 24.Since there are two end positions, total is 24 * 2 = 48.Wait, but actually, no. Because when ab is at position 1-2, it's a separate case from ab at position 5-6. So, for each of these two cases, we have 12 * 2 arrangements.So, total for Case 1: 2 * (12 * 2) = 48.Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again.No, actually, for each end position (1-2 and 5-6), we have:- 2 possibilities for ab (ab or ba).- For each, 12 arrangements of c, d, e, f without c and d adjacent.Therefore, for each end position, it's 2 * 12 = 24.Since there are two end positions, total is 24 * 2 = 48.Yes, that seems correct.Case 2: ab block is in the middle positions: 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5. Wait, actually, ab can be placed at positions 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5. So, three middle positions.Wait, no, ab can be placed at positions 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5. So, three positions.Wait, but earlier I thought ab can be placed at positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6. So, five positions in total.So, Case 1: ab at 1-2 or 5-6: two positions.Case 2: ab at 2-3, 3-4, 4-5: three positions.So, for each of these middle positions, the remaining slots are split into two separate blocks.For example, if ab is at 2-3, remaining slots are 1 and 4-5-6.Similarly, ab at 3-4, remaining slots are 1-2 and 5-6.Ab at 4-5, remaining slots are 1-2-3 and 6.So, in each case, the remaining slots are split into two separate blocks.Therefore, in each of these cases, we have two separate blocks where we need to place c, d, e, f, with the condition that c and d are not adjacent.Wait, but since the remaining slots are split into two separate blocks, c and d can be placed in different blocks, which would automatically make them not adjacent.Alternatively, if c and d are placed in the same block, they might be adjacent or not.Wait, this is getting complicated, but let's try.So, for each middle position of ab, the remaining slots are split into two separate blocks. Let's denote the sizes of these blocks.For example, if ab is at 2-3, the remaining slots are 1 (size 1) and 4-5-6 (size 3).Similarly, ab at 3-4: remaining slots are 1-2 (size 2) and 5-6 (size 2).Ab at 4-5: remaining slots are 1-2-3 (size 3) and 6 (size 1).So, for each of these, we have two blocks of different sizes.Now, we need to arrange c, d, e, f into these two blocks, ensuring that c and d are not adjacent.Wait, but since the blocks are separate, c and d can be in the same block or different blocks.If they are in different blocks, they are automatically not adjacent.If they are in the same block, we need to ensure they are not adjacent within that block.So, perhaps we can calculate the number of ways where c and d are in different blocks plus the number of ways where c and d are in the same block but not adjacent.But this might be a bit involved.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions and subtract the number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent.But since the remaining slots are split into two blocks, the adjacency of c and d can only occur within a single block.So, let's proceed.First, for each middle position of ab, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange c, d, e, f in the remaining slots such that c and d are not adjacent.Let's take ab at position 2-3 as an example.Remaining slots: 1 (size 1) and 4-5-6 (size 3).We need to place c, d, e, f into these two blocks.First, decide how many items go into each block.The size 1 block can hold 1 item, and the size 3 block can hold 3 items.So, we need to choose 1 item out of c, d, e, f to go into the size 1 block, and the remaining 3 items go into the size 3 block.The number of ways to choose which item goes into the size 1 block is C(4,1) = 4.Once chosen, the item is placed in the size 1 block, and the remaining three items are placed in the size 3 block.Now, within the size 3 block, we need to arrange the three items such that c and d are not adjacent.Wait, but if c and d are both in the size 3 block, we need to ensure they are not adjacent.Alternatively, if c and d are in different blocks, they are automatically not adjacent.So, let's calculate the total number of arrangements where c and d are not adjacent.Total number of ways to arrange c, d, e, f into the two blocks without any restrictions:First, choose which item goes into the size 1 block: 4 choices.Then, arrange the remaining three items in the size 3 block: 3! = 6 ways.So, total arrangements: 4 * 6 = 24.But this is without considering the restriction on c and d.Now, the number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent:This can happen only if both c and d are in the same block.Since the size 1 block can only hold one item, c and d cannot both be in the size 1 block. Therefore, c and d must both be in the size 3 block.So, the number of ways where c and d are adjacent is:First, choose which item goes into the size 1 block. It can't be c or d, because if it were, c and d would both be in the size 3 block, but we need to calculate the cases where c and d are adjacent.Wait, actually, if we choose an item other than c or d to go into the size 1 block, then c and d are both in the size 3 block.If we choose c or d to go into the size 1 block, then the other is in the size 3 block, so they can't be adjacent.Therefore, the number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent is:Number of ways where both c and d are in the size 3 block and are adjacent.So, first, choose an item other than c or d to go into the size 1 block: 2 choices (e or f).Then, in the size 3 block, we have c, d, and the remaining item (either f or e, depending on what was chosen).Now, we need to arrange c, d, and the remaining item in the size 3 block such that c and d are adjacent.Treat c and d as a block, so we have two items: cd or dc, and the remaining item.The number of ways to arrange these is 2 (for cd or dc) * 2 (positions: cd can be first or second in the block) = 4.Wait, actually, in a size 3 block, arranging c, d, and another item with c and d adjacent.So, treat c and d as a block, which can be in two orders: cd or dc.This block can be placed in two positions within the size 3 block: positions 1-2 or 2-3.Wait, no, in a size 3 block, the cd block can start at position 1 or position 2.So, for each order of cd (cd or dc), there are two positions.Therefore, total arrangements where c and d are adjacent in the size 3 block: 2 (orders) * 2 (positions) = 4.But wait, actually, once we fix the order of cd, the number of positions is 2.So, for cd, we can have cd in positions 1-2 or 2-3.Similarly, for dc, we can have dc in positions 1-2 or 2-3.Therefore, total arrangements: 2 (orders) * 2 (positions) = 4.But wait, the remaining item has to be placed in the remaining position.So, for example, if cd is in positions 1-2, the remaining item is in position 3.If cd is in positions 2-3, the remaining item is in position 1.Similarly for dc.Therefore, for each order (cd or dc), there are two arrangements.Therefore, total arrangements where c and d are adjacent in the size 3 block: 2 * 2 = 4.But wait, actually, for each choice of the item in the size 1 block (e or f), we have 4 arrangements.So, total arrangements where c and d are adjacent: 2 (choices for size 1 block) * 4 (arrangements in size 3 block) = 8.Therefore, the number of arrangements where c and d are not adjacent is total arrangements minus arrangements where they are adjacent: 24 - 8 = 16.But wait, let's double-check.Total arrangements without restriction: 4 * 6 = 24.Arrangements where c and d are adjacent: 8.Therefore, arrangements where c and d are not adjacent: 24 - 8 = 16.Therefore, for ab at position 2-3, the number of valid arrangements is 16.But wait, we also have to consider the ab block can be ab or ba. So, for each of these 16 arrangements, there are 2 possibilities for ab.Therefore, total arrangements for ab at position 2-3: 16 * 2 = 32.Similarly, for ab at position 4-5, the situation is symmetric to ab at position 2-3. So, the number of arrangements would also be 32.Now, let's consider ab at position 3-4.In this case, the remaining slots are 1-2 and 5-6, each of size 2.So, we have two blocks of size 2 each.We need to arrange c, d, e, f into these two blocks, with the condition that c and d are not adjacent.Since the blocks are separate, c and d can be in different blocks or in the same block.If they are in different blocks, they are automatically not adjacent.If they are in the same block, we need to ensure they are not adjacent within that block.So, let's calculate the total number of arrangements without restriction and subtract the number where c and d are adjacent.Total number of ways to arrange c, d, e, f into two blocks of size 2 each:First, choose two items for the first block (positions 1-2) and the remaining two go to the second block (positions 5-6).The number of ways to choose two items out of four is C(4,2) = 6.Then, arrange the two items in the first block: 2! = 2 ways.Arrange the two items in the second block: 2! = 2 ways.Therefore, total arrangements: 6 * 2 * 2 = 24.Now, the number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent:This can happen in two ways:1. Both c and d are in the same block, and are adjacent.2. c and d are in different blocks, but since the blocks are separate, they can't be adjacent.Wait, actually, if c and d are in different blocks, they are not adjacent because the blocks are separated by the ab block.Therefore, the only way c and d can be adjacent is if they are in the same block and placed next to each other.So, let's calculate that.Number of ways where c and d are in the same block and adjacent.First, choose which block they are in: either the first block (positions 1-2) or the second block (positions 5-6). So, 2 choices.In each block, we need to arrange c and d such that they are adjacent.Since each block is of size 2, the only way they can be adjacent is if they are the two items in the block.So, for each block, the number of arrangements where c and d are adjacent is 2 (cd or dc).But wait, since the block has exactly two items, c and d, the number of arrangements where they are adjacent is 2.But we also need to choose the other two items (e and f) to go into the other block.So, for each choice of block (first or second), we have:- Place c and d in the chosen block, arranged as cd or dc: 2 ways.- Place e and f in the other block, arranged as ef or fe: 2 ways.Therefore, for each block, the number of arrangements is 2 * 2 = 4.Since there are two blocks, total arrangements where c and d are adjacent: 2 * 4 = 8.Therefore, the number of arrangements where c and d are not adjacent is total arrangements minus adjacent arrangements: 24 - 8 = 16.Again, considering the ab block can be ab or ba, each of these 16 arrangements can have 2 possibilities for ab.Therefore, total arrangements for ab at position 3-4: 16 * 2 = 32.So, summarizing Case 2:- Ab at position 2-3: 32 arrangements.- Ab at position 3-4: 32 arrangements.- Ab at position 4-5: 32 arrangements.Wait, no, ab at position 4-5 is symmetric to ab at position 2-3, so it should also have 32 arrangements.But wait, earlier, for ab at position 2-3 and 4-5, we calculated 32 each, and for ab at position 3-4, we also have 32.Therefore, total for Case 2: 32 * 3 = 96.Wait, but let's check:- Ab at 2-3: 32.- Ab at 3-4: 32.- Ab at 4-5: 32.Total: 32 * 3 = 96.Therefore, total arrangements for Case 2: 96.Now, combining Case 1 and Case 2:Case 1: 48 arrangements.Case 2: 96 arrangements.Total arrangements: 48 + 96 = 144.Yes, that matches our previous result.Therefore, the total number of different arrangements is 144.So, after considering all possible cases and approaches, I'm confident that the answer is 144.**Final Answer**The total number of different arrangements is boxed{144}."},{"question":"Nine people sit down at random seats around a round table. Four of them are math majors, three others are physics majors, and the two remaining people are biology majors. What is the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats?","answer":"Okay, so I have this probability problem here: Nine people are sitting randomly around a round table. There are four math majors, three physics majors, and two biology majors. I need to find the probability that all four math majors end up sitting consecutively. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, since it's a circular table, I remember that in circular permutations, the number of ways to arrange n people is (n-1)! instead of n! because rotations are considered the same. So, for nine people, the total number of possible seating arrangements is (9-1)! which is 8! That should be the denominator in my probability calculation because it's the total number of possible outcomes.Now, for the numerator, I need the number of favorable outcomes where all four math majors are sitting together. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Well, if all four math majors are sitting together, we can think of them as a single \\"block\\" or \\"unit.\\" So instead of having nine individual people, we now have this one block plus the remaining five people (three physics majors and two biology majors). That makes a total of six units to arrange around the table.But wait, since it's a circular table, the number of ways to arrange these six units would be (6-1)! which is 5!. But hold on, within that math block, the four math majors can be arranged among themselves in different ways. So, we need to multiply by 4! to account for all the permutations of the math majors within their block.So, putting that together, the number of favorable arrangements is 5! multiplied by 4!. Let me write that down:Number of favorable arrangements = 5! × 4!Therefore, the probability should be the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements, which is 8!. So, probability P is:P = (5! × 4!) / 8!Let me compute that. First, let's recall the factorials:5! = 1204! = 248! = 40320So, plugging in the numbers:P = (120 × 24) / 40320Let me calculate the numerator first:120 × 24 = 2880So, P = 2880 / 40320Now, simplifying that fraction. Let's see, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2880.Wait, 40320 divided by 2880 is... let me compute 40320 ÷ 2880.Well, 2880 × 14 = 40320 because 2880 × 10 = 28800, and 2880 × 4 = 11520; adding those together gives 28800 + 11520 = 40320. So, 2880 × 14 = 40320.Therefore, 2880 / 40320 = 1 / 14.So, the probability is 1/14.Wait, let me double-check that because sometimes with circular permutations, it's easy to make a mistake.So, total number of arrangements is 8! = 40320. Number of favorable arrangements is 5! × 4! = 120 × 24 = 2880. 2880 divided by 40320 is indeed 1/14. Hmm, that seems correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is fixing one person's position to eliminate the circular symmetry. Let's fix one math major in a specific seat. Then, the remaining three math majors need to sit consecutively next to this fixed math major. Since the table is circular, we can fix one seat, and the problem becomes arranging the others linearly relative to that fixed seat.So, if we fix one math major, the three other math majors can be arranged in 3! ways in the next three seats. Then, the remaining five people can be arranged in 5! ways. But wait, is that the case?Wait, actually, if we fix one math major, the next three seats must be occupied by the other three math majors. So, the number of ways to arrange the math majors is 3! (since one is fixed). Then, the remaining five seats can be filled by the other five people in 5! ways. So, the number of favorable arrangements would be 3! × 5!.But wait, the total number of arrangements when fixing one seat is (9-1)! = 8! as before, but since we fixed one seat, the total number of arrangements is actually 8! / 9 = 8! / 9? Wait, no, fixing one seat in circular permutations reduces the total number of arrangements to (n-1)! So, if we fix one seat, the total number of arrangements is 8! / 9? Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, actually, when you fix one person's seat in a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! So, in this case, fixing one math major's seat, the total number of arrangements is 8!.But wait, no, if we fix one seat, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! regardless. So, whether we fix a seat or not, the total number of arrangements is 8!.But in this case, if we fix one math major, the number of favorable arrangements is 3! × 5! because the other three math majors can be arranged in 3! ways, and the remaining five people can be arranged in 5! ways.So, number of favorable arrangements is 3! × 5! = 6 × 120 = 720.Wait, but earlier I had 5! × 4! = 2880. So, which is correct?Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because when I fixed one math major, the other three math majors can be arranged in 3! ways, but their positions are fixed relative to the first math major. So, the block is fixed in position once we fix the first math major.But in the previous approach, treating the four math majors as a block, we had 5! arrangements for the blocks and 4! arrangements within the block, giving 5! × 4!.But when fixing one seat, the number of favorable arrangements is 3! × 5!.But 3! × 5! is 720, whereas 5! × 4! is 2880. These are different numbers, so which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the issue is whether we fix a seat or not. Let me clarify.In circular permutations, fixing a seat is a common technique to avoid counting rotations multiple times. So, when we fix one person's seat, we effectively turn the problem into a linear arrangement problem for the remaining people.So, if we fix one math major's seat, then we have eight remaining seats. The other three math majors need to sit in the next three seats in some order, and the remaining five people can sit anywhere else.Wait, but actually, the four math majors can be seated consecutively starting from the fixed seat, but they could also be seated consecutively starting from any of the other seats. Wait, no, if we fix one math major, the other math majors can be seated either clockwise or counter-clockwise from that fixed seat. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.Wait, perhaps the first approach is better. Let me think again.In circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange n people is (n-1)!.When considering a block of four math majors, we can treat them as a single entity, so we have six entities in total (the math block plus the five other individuals). The number of ways to arrange six entities around a circular table is (6-1)! = 5!.Within the math block, the four math majors can be arranged in 4! ways.Therefore, the total number of favorable arrangements is 5! × 4!.Total number of arrangements is 8!.Therefore, the probability is (5! × 4!) / 8! = (120 × 24) / 40320 = 2880 / 40320 = 1/14.But when I fixed one math major, I thought the number of favorable arrangements was 3! × 5! = 720, but that seems conflicting.Wait, perhaps when fixing one seat, the total number of arrangements is 8! / 9? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.Wait, actually, if we fix one seat, the total number of arrangements is 8! because we've fixed one person, so the remaining eight can be arranged in 8! ways.But in that case, the number of favorable arrangements is 3! × 5! because the other three math majors can be arranged in 3! ways, and the remaining five people can be arranged in 5! ways.So, 3! × 5! = 720.Therefore, the probability would be 720 / 40320 = 720 / 40320 = 1 / 56.Wait, that's conflicting with the previous result.Hmm, so which approach is correct? Is the probability 1/14 or 1/56?Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether we fix a seat or not. Let me think.In the first approach, we didn't fix any seat, so the total number of arrangements is 8!.In the second approach, we fixed one seat, so the total number of arrangements is 8!.Wait, no, if we fix one seat, the total number of arrangements is 8! because we've fixed one person, so the remaining eight can be arranged in 8! ways.But in the first approach, we considered the total number of arrangements as 8! as well, because it's a circular table with nine people, so (9-1)! = 8!.Wait, so both approaches have the same total number of arrangements, 8!.But in the first approach, the number of favorable arrangements is 5! × 4! = 2880.In the second approach, the number of favorable arrangements is 3! × 5! = 720.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the second approach is wrong because when we fix one seat, we have to consider that the block can start at any position relative to the fixed seat.Wait, no, if we fix one math major, then the other three math majors have to be seated consecutively either to the left or to the right of the fixed math major.Wait, but in a circular table, left and right are relative, so actually, once we fix one math major, the other math majors can be seated in the next three seats either clockwise or counter-clockwise.Wait, so actually, there are two possible directions for the block: clockwise or counter-clockwise.Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements would be 2 × 3! × 5!.Because for each direction, the three math majors can be arranged in 3! ways, and the remaining five people can be arranged in 5! ways.So, 2 × 3! × 5! = 2 × 6 × 120 = 1440.Therefore, the probability would be 1440 / 40320 = 1440 / 40320.Simplify that: 1440 ÷ 1440 = 1, 40320 ÷ 1440 = 28. So, 1/28.Wait, now we have another result: 1/28.Hmm, so now I have three different results: 1/14, 1/56, and 1/28. Clearly, I'm making a mistake somewhere.Let me try to clarify.First, let's think about the problem without fixing any seats.Total number of arrangements: (9-1)! = 40320.Number of favorable arrangements: Treat the four math majors as a single block. So, we have six blocks (the math block and the five other individuals). The number of ways to arrange six blocks around a circular table is (6-1)! = 120. Within the math block, the four can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. So, total favorable arrangements: 120 × 24 = 2880.Thus, probability is 2880 / 40320 = 1/14.Alternatively, if we fix one seat, say, fix a math major in seat 1, then the other three math majors can be seated in seats 2,3,4 or seats 9,8,7 (since it's a circular table). So, two possible positions for the block.For each position, the three math majors can be arranged in 3! ways, and the remaining five people can be arranged in 5! ways.So, number of favorable arrangements: 2 × 3! × 5! = 2 × 6 × 120 = 1440.Total number of arrangements when fixing one seat: 8! = 40320.Thus, probability is 1440 / 40320 = 1/28.Wait, so why is there a discrepancy?Ah, I think the issue is that when we fix one seat, we are effectively considering a different sample space. Because fixing a seat reduces the total number of possible arrangements, but in reality, the total number of arrangements is still 8!.Wait, no, actually, when we fix one seat, we're just accounting for rotational symmetry by fixing one person's position, so the total number of arrangements is still 8!.But in the fixed seat approach, the number of favorable arrangements is 1440, leading to a probability of 1/28, whereas in the block approach, it's 2880, leading to 1/14.So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the block approach is overcounting because when we treat the four math majors as a block, we might be considering rotations where the block is in different positions as distinct, but in reality, in circular tables, rotations are considered the same.Wait, no, because when we treat the block as a single entity, we're already accounting for circular permutations by using (6-1)!.Wait, let me think differently.Suppose we have nine seats arranged in a circle. The number of ways to choose four consecutive seats is nine, because in a circle, each seat can be the start of a block of four consecutive seats.Wait, is that correct? For example, seat 1,2,3,4; seat 2,3,4,5; ... seat 9,1,2,3. So, yes, there are nine possible blocks of four consecutive seats.Therefore, the number of ways to choose four consecutive seats is nine.Once we've chosen the block, the four math majors can be arranged in 4! ways, and the remaining five people can be arranged in 5! ways.Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 9 × 4! × 5!.But wait, in circular permutations, are these nine blocks considered distinct? Because in circular tables, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same.Wait, no, actually, when we fix the table, each block is a distinct set of seats. So, if we fix the table, meaning we consider seat 1, seat 2, etc., as fixed positions, then the number of ways is 9 × 4! × 5!.But in circular permutations, we usually consider arrangements the same up to rotation. So, if we fix one seat, say seat 1, then the number of distinct arrangements is 8!.But if we don't fix any seat, the number of distinct arrangements is 8!.Wait, so maybe the correct way is:If we consider the table fixed (i.e., seat positions are labeled), then the number of favorable arrangements is 9 × 4! × 5!.But if the table is not fixed, meaning rotations are considered the same, then the number of favorable arrangements is (number of distinct blocks) × 4! × 5!.But in circular permutations, the number of distinct blocks of four consecutive seats is nine, but since the table is circular, these blocks are all rotationally equivalent.Wait, this is getting complicated.Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to fix one seat to eliminate rotational symmetry, and then compute the probability accordingly.So, fix one seat, say seat 1, and compute the probability that the next three seats (2,3,4) are all math majors, given that seat 1 is a math major.Wait, but seat 1 could be any person, not necessarily a math major.Wait, maybe a better approach is to fix one seat, say seat 1, and then compute the probability that seats 1,2,3,4 are all math majors.But since the table is circular, the probability that any four consecutive seats are all math majors is the same, regardless of where you start.So, the probability that seats 1,2,3,4 are all math majors is equal to the probability that any four consecutive seats are all math majors.Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the four math majors in seats 1,2,3,4 and the remaining five people in the other seats.So, number of favorable arrangements: 4! × 5!.Total number of arrangements: 9! / 9 = 8!.Wait, no, total number of arrangements when fixing seat 1 is 8!.Wait, actually, if we fix seat 1, the total number of arrangements is 8!.But the number of favorable arrangements is 4! × 5!.Wait, no, because seat 1 is fixed as a math major, so the remaining three math majors must be in seats 2,3,4, which can be arranged in 3! ways, and the remaining five people can be arranged in 5! ways.So, number of favorable arrangements: 3! × 5!.Therefore, probability is (3! × 5!) / 8! = (6 × 120) / 40320 = 720 / 40320 = 1 / 56.But earlier, when considering the block approach without fixing a seat, we got 1/14.So, which is correct?Wait, I think the confusion arises from whether we fix a seat or not. If we fix a seat, the probability is 1/56, but if we don't fix a seat, the probability is 1/14.But in reality, in circular permutations, whether we fix a seat or not depends on how we define our sample space.Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to fix a seat to avoid overcounting due to rotational symmetry.So, let's fix seat 1. Then, the total number of arrangements is 8!.The number of favorable arrangements is the number of ways that seats 1,2,3,4 are all math majors.So, seat 1 is fixed as a math major. The remaining three math majors must be in seats 2,3,4. The number of ways to arrange the math majors is 3! (since seat 1 is fixed). The remaining five people can be arranged in 5! ways.Therefore, number of favorable arrangements: 3! × 5! = 720.Thus, probability is 720 / 40320 = 1/56.But wait, that seems low. Earlier, treating the block as a single entity, we had 1/14.Wait, maybe the issue is that when we fix seat 1, we're only considering the case where the block starts at seat 1. But in reality, the block can start at any seat, so there are nine possible starting positions.But in circular permutations, fixing one seat effectively counts only one starting position.Wait, so perhaps the correct number of favorable arrangements is 9 × (number of arrangements for one block).But if we fix seat 1, we're only considering one block starting at seat 1. So, to account for all possible blocks, we need to multiply by 9.But wait, in circular permutations, if we fix seat 1, we can't multiply by 9 because we've already fixed the table.Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to approach it differently.Another approach: In a circular table, the number of ways to arrange n people is (n-1)!.The number of ways to arrange the four math majors together is: treat them as a block, so we have six blocks (math block + five individuals). The number of ways to arrange six blocks around a table is (6-1)! = 120. Within the math block, the four can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. So, total favorable arrangements: 120 × 24 = 2880.Total arrangements: 8! = 40320.Probability: 2880 / 40320 = 1/14.Alternatively, another way: The probability that all four math majors sit together is equal to the number of ways to choose four consecutive seats times the number of ways to arrange the math majors in those seats times the number of ways to arrange the rest, divided by the total number of arrangements.Number of ways to choose four consecutive seats in a circular table: 9 (since it's circular, there are nine possible starting positions for the block).Number of ways to arrange the math majors in those four seats: 4!.Number of ways to arrange the remaining five people: 5!.Therefore, number of favorable arrangements: 9 × 4! × 5! = 9 × 24 × 120 = 25920.Wait, but 25920 is greater than 40320, which is the total number of arrangements. That can't be.Wait, that must be wrong because 9 × 4! × 5! = 9 × 24 × 120 = 25920, which is larger than 8! = 40320. So, that approach is incorrect.Wait, why? Because when we fix the four seats, we're overcounting because in circular permutations, some arrangements are equivalent.Wait, perhaps the mistake is that when we fix four consecutive seats, we're considering labeled seats, but in circular permutations, arrangements are considered the same up to rotation.So, maybe the number of distinct blocks is not nine, but one, because all blocks are rotationally equivalent.Wait, that doesn't make sense because in reality, the four math majors can be seated in different positions relative to the other people.Wait, perhaps the correct number of favorable arrangements is (number of ways to arrange the math block) × (number of ways to arrange the rest). But since the table is circular, the number of ways to arrange the math block is (n - k + 1)! where n is total people and k is the block size? Wait, no, that's for linear arrangements.Wait, maybe I need to use the formula for circular arrangements where we have a block.I found a formula online once that says the number of ways to arrange n people around a circular table with k people sitting together is (k-1)! × (n - k)! × n / n = (k-1)! × (n - k)!.Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.Wait, actually, another way: The number of ways to arrange n people around a circular table with k people sitting together is (n - k + 1)! × k!.But I'm not sure.Wait, let me think again.If we have n people around a circular table, the number of ways to arrange them so that k specific people are seated together is (n - k)! × k!.But wait, that's for linear arrangements. For circular arrangements, it's (n - k)! × k! / (n - k + 1). Hmm, not sure.Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for circular permutations with a block.The formula is: (n - k)! × k! / n.Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.Wait, let me think of it as fixing the block.If we fix the block of k people together, then we can consider the block as a single entity, so we have (n - k + 1) entities to arrange around the table.The number of ways to arrange these entities is (n - k)! because it's a circular arrangement.Within the block, the k people can be arranged in k! ways.Therefore, the total number of favorable arrangements is (n - k)! × k!.But in our case, n = 9, k = 4.So, number of favorable arrangements = (9 - 4)! × 4! = 5! × 4! = 120 × 24 = 2880.Which is the same as the first approach.Therefore, the probability is 2880 / 40320 = 1/14.So, that seems consistent.But when I fixed one seat, I got a different answer. So, perhaps fixing one seat is not the right approach because it undercounts the number of favorable arrangements.Wait, no, actually, when I fixed one seat, I considered only one specific block starting at that seat, but in reality, the block can start anywhere, so I should have multiplied by the number of possible starting positions.But in circular permutations, when you fix one seat, you're effectively considering only one rotational position, so the number of favorable arrangements is only for that specific block.But in reality, the block can be anywhere, so perhaps the fixed seat approach is undercounting.Wait, so maybe the correct probability is 1/14.But let me check with another method.Another way to compute the probability is to consider the probability that the next three people after a fixed math major are also math majors.So, fix one math major. Then, the probability that the next seat is a math major is 3/8 (since there are three math majors left out of eight remaining people). Then, the probability that the next seat is a math major is 2/7, and then 1/6.So, the probability would be (3/8) × (2/7) × (1/6) = (6) / (336) = 1 / 56.But wait, that's the probability that the next three seats are math majors. But in a circular table, the block can be in any position, not necessarily starting at the fixed seat.So, since the block can start at any of the nine seats, we need to multiply this probability by 9.Wait, but in circular permutations, fixing one seat already accounts for rotational symmetry, so multiplying by 9 would be overcounting.Wait, actually, no, because when we fix one seat, we're considering only one specific starting position. To account for all possible starting positions, we need to consider that the block can start at any of the nine seats, but since we've fixed one seat, we can only account for one starting position. Therefore, the probability is 1/56.But that contradicts the earlier result of 1/14.Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 1/14 because when we treat the block as a single entity, we're accounting for all possible rotations.Wait, let me think of it as arranging the math block and the other people.In circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange the math block is (n - k + 1)! × k! where n=9, k=4.Wait, but that formula might not be accurate.Wait, actually, the correct formula is (n - 1)! / (n - k)! for arranging k people together in a circular table.Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.Wait, I think the correct approach is to use the formula for circular permutations with a block.The formula is: (n - k)! × k! / n.Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the number of circular arrangements where m specific people sit together: (m - 1)! × (n - m)!.But in our case, m=4, n=9.So, number of favorable arrangements = (4 - 1)! × (9 - 4)! = 6 × 120 = 720.But that contradicts the earlier result.Wait, no, that formula is for arranging m specific people together in a circular table, treating them as a single entity, so the number of arrangements is (m - 1)! × (n - m)!.Wait, but in our case, n=9, m=4.So, number of favorable arrangements = (4 - 1)! × (9 - 4)! = 6 × 120 = 720.But total number of arrangements is 8! = 40320.So, probability is 720 / 40320 = 1 / 56.But this contradicts the earlier result of 1/14.Wait, now I'm really confused.Wait, let me check online for the formula.Wait, I can't actually check online, but I recall that the number of ways to arrange n people around a circular table with k specific people sitting together is (k - 1)! × (n - k)!.So, in our case, (4 - 1)! × (9 - 4)! = 6 × 120 = 720.Therefore, probability is 720 / 40320 = 1 / 56.But earlier, treating the block as a single entity, we had 5! × 4! = 2880, which gives probability 1/14.So, which is correct?Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.Wait, let me think again.If we have n people around a circular table, and we want k specific people to sit together, we can treat them as a single block. Then, the number of blocks is (n - k + 1). The number of ways to arrange these blocks is (n - k)! because it's a circular arrangement.Within the block, the k people can be arranged in k! ways.Therefore, total number of favorable arrangements is (n - k)! × k!.But in our case, n=9, k=4.So, (9 - 4)! × 4! = 5! × 4! = 120 × 24 = 2880.Which is the same as the first approach.Therefore, the probability is 2880 / 40320 = 1/14.So, that seems correct.But then why does the formula (k - 1)! × (n - k)! give a different result?Wait, perhaps that formula is for arranging the k people in a circle, but in our case, the k people are sitting together in a straight block, not necessarily in a circle.Therefore, the correct formula is treating the block as a linear entity, so the number of ways is (n - k)! × k!.Therefore, the probability is (5! × 4!) / 8! = 1/14.Therefore, the correct answer is 1/14.But then, when I fixed one seat, I got 1/56, which is conflicting.Wait, perhaps the issue is that when I fixed one seat, I was considering only one specific block, but in reality, the block can be anywhere, so the probability should be multiplied by the number of possible positions.But in circular permutations, fixing one seat already accounts for rotational symmetry, so the number of favorable arrangements is only for that specific block.Wait, but in reality, the block can be anywhere, so the probability should be the same regardless of where you fix the seat.Wait, I'm getting myself in a loop here.Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1/14, as derived from the block approach, because it's a standard formula for circular permutations with a block.Therefore, I think the probability is 1/14.But just to be thorough, let me think of another way.Imagine seating the nine people one by one. The probability that the four math majors sit together can be calculated by considering the probability that each subsequent math major sits next to the previous one.But in a circular table, the first person can sit anywhere, so let's fix the first math major's seat. Then, the probability that the second math major sits next to the first is 2/8 (since there are two seats adjacent to the first math major, and eight remaining seats).Then, the probability that the third math major sits next to the second (and thus forming a consecutive block) is 1/7 (since only one seat adjacent to the second math major is available, as the other is already occupied by the first math major).Then, the probability that the fourth math major sits next to the third is 1/6.Therefore, the probability is (2/8) × (1/7) × (1/6) = (2) / (336) = 1 / 168.But wait, that seems too low.Wait, but this approach is only considering the probability that the math majors sit in a specific order, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.But in reality, the math majors can sit in any order within the block.Therefore, we need to multiply by the number of permutations of the math majors within the block, which is 4!.So, the probability becomes (2/8) × (1/7) × (1/6) × 4! = (2/8) × (1/7) × (1/6) × 24.Calculating that:(2/8) = 1/41/4 × 1/7 = 1/281/28 × 1/6 = 1/1681/168 × 24 = 24 / 168 = 1/7.Wait, that's 1/7, which is different from both previous results.Hmm, so now I have another answer: 1/7.This is getting really confusing.Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the multiplication by 4!.Because when we fix the first math major, the subsequent math majors are being seated relative to the first, so the number of ways to arrange them is 3! (since the first is fixed).Therefore, the probability should be (2/8) × (1/7) × (1/6) × 3! = (2/8) × (1/7) × (1/6) × 6.Calculating that:(2/8) = 1/41/4 × 1/7 = 1/281/28 × 1/6 = 1/1681/168 × 6 = 6/168 = 1/28.So, probability is 1/28.But that's conflicting with the earlier results.Wait, so now I have 1/14, 1/28, and 1/56 as possible answers.This is really frustrating.Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 1/14 because that's the result from the standard block method, which is a reliable approach.Alternatively, let me think of it as arranging the math majors in four consecutive seats.In a circular table, the number of ways to choose four consecutive seats is nine, as each seat can be the start of a block.For each block, the number of ways to arrange the math majors is 4!.The number of ways to arrange the remaining five people is 5!.Therefore, total favorable arrangements: 9 × 4! × 5! = 9 × 24 × 120 = 25920.But total number of arrangements is 9! = 362880.Wait, but in circular permutations, total number of arrangements is (9-1)! = 40320.So, 25920 / 40320 = 25920 / 40320 = 25920 ÷ 40320 = 0.642857... which is 9/14.Wait, that can't be right because the probability can't be greater than 1.Wait, no, 25920 / 40320 = 0.642857, which is 9/14, but that's greater than 1, which is impossible.Wait, no, 25920 / 40320 = 0.642857, which is less than 1, but 9/14 is approximately 0.642857.Wait, but that would mean the probability is 9/14, which is greater than 1/2, which seems high.Wait, but that approach is wrong because when we fix the four seats, we're overcounting because in circular permutations, some arrangements are equivalent.Therefore, that approach is incorrect.Wait, so going back, the correct approach is treating the four math majors as a block, leading to 5! × 4! = 2880 favorable arrangements, and total arrangements 8! = 40320, so probability is 1/14.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 1/14.But just to make sure, let me think of a smaller case.Suppose we have four people around a table: two math majors (M) and two physics majors (P). What's the probability that the two math majors sit together?Using the block method: treat the two M's as a block, so we have three entities: [MM], P, P.Number of ways to arrange three entities around a table: (3-1)! = 2.Within the block, the two M's can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.Total favorable arrangements: 2 × 2 = 4.Total number of arrangements: (4-1)! = 6.Probability: 4 / 6 = 2/3.Alternatively, using the fixed seat method: fix one M in a seat. The probability that the other M is in one of the two adjacent seats is 2/3 (since there are three remaining seats, two of which are adjacent). So, probability is 2/3, which matches the block method.Therefore, in this smaller case, the block method works.Similarly, in our original problem, treating the four math majors as a block gives the correct probability.Therefore, I think the correct answer is 1/14.**Final Answer**The probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats is boxed{dfrac{1}{14}}."},{"question":"Add 81.76 to 34.587 and round your answer to the nearest tenth.","answer":"First, I need to add 81.76 and 34.587.

Pipe (A) alone can fill pool (M) in 5 hours; pipe (B) alone can fill pool (N) in 5 hours; pipe (C) alone can fill pool (N) in 6 hours. If pipes (A), (B), and (C) are opened simultaneously, with (A) always filling pool (M), (C) always filling pool (N), and (B) starting by filling pool (M) and then switching to fill pool (N), the two pools are both filled exactly at the same time. How many hours does pipe (B) fill pool (M)?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about two pools, M and N, and three pipes, A, B, and C. The goal is to figure out how many hours pipe B spends filling pool M before switching to pool N. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, the problem states that the volume of pool M is 1.5 times that of pool N. So, if I let the volume of pool N be V, then the volume of pool M would be 1.5V. That makes sense.Next, it mentions the rates at which each pipe can fill their respective pools. Pipe A alone can fill pool M in 5 hours. So, the rate of pipe A is Volume of M divided by 5 hours, which is 1.5V / 5. Let me write that as (1.5V)/5. Similarly, pipe B alone can fill pool N in 5 hours, so its rate is V / 5. Pipe C alone can fill pool N in 6 hours, so its rate is V / 6.Now, the setup is that all three pipes are opened simultaneously. Pipe A is always filling pool M, pipe C is always filling pool N, and pipe B starts by filling pool M and then switches to fill pool N at some point. The key here is that both pools are filled exactly at the same time. So, I need to find the time t when pool M is filled and the same time when pool N is filled, considering that pipe B switches from M to N at some point.Let me denote the time that pipe B spends filling pool M as x hours. Then, the remaining time that pipe B spends filling pool N would be (t - x) hours, since the total time taken to fill both pools is t hours.So, for pool M, the total filling is done by pipe A and pipe B for x hours. The combined rate for pool M would be the rate of A plus the rate of B. Similarly, for pool N, the total filling is done by pipe C and pipe B for (t - x) hours. The combined rate for pool N would be the rate of C plus the rate of B.Let me write down the equations for both pools.For pool M:The volume filled by A in t hours is (1.5V)/5 * t.The volume filled by B in x hours is (V)/5 * x.So, the total volume filled in pool M is:(1.5V)/5 * t + (V)/5 * x = 1.5VFor pool N:The volume filled by C in t hours is (V)/6 * t.The volume filled by B in (t - x) hours is (V)/5 * (t - x).So, the total volume filled in pool N is:(V)/6 * t + (V)/5 * (t - x) = VNow, I can simplify both equations by dividing out V since it's a common factor.Starting with pool M:(1.5/5) * t + (1/5) * x = 1.5Simplify 1.5/5: that's 0.3. So,0.3t + 0.2x = 1.5Wait, hold on, 1/5 is 0.2, right? So, 0.3t + 0.2x = 1.5.Similarly, for pool N:(1/6) * t + (1/5) * (t - x) = 1Let me compute each term:1/6 * t is approximately 0.1667t, and 1/5 is 0.2, so 0.2*(t - x) is 0.2t - 0.2x.Adding them together:0.1667t + 0.2t - 0.2x = 1Combine like terms:(0.1667 + 0.2)t - 0.2x = 10.3667t - 0.2x = 1Hmm, so now I have two equations:1) 0.3t + 0.2x = 1.52) 0.3667t - 0.2x = 1I can solve this system of equations. Let me write them again:Equation 1: 0.3t + 0.2x = 1.5Equation 2: 0.3667t - 0.2x = 1If I add these two equations together, the x terms will cancel out.Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:0.3t + 0.2x + 0.3667t - 0.2x = 1.5 + 1Simplify:(0.3 + 0.3667)t + (0.2x - 0.2x) = 2.5So, 0.6667t = 2.5Therefore, t = 2.5 / 0.6667Calculating that: 2.5 divided by 0.6667 is approximately 3.75. Wait, 0.6667 is approximately 2/3, so 2.5 divided by (2/3) is 2.5 * (3/2) = 3.75. So, t is 3.75 hours.Now that I have t, I can substitute back into one of the equations to find x. Let's use Equation 1:0.3t + 0.2x = 1.5Plugging t = 3.75:0.3 * 3.75 + 0.2x = 1.5Calculate 0.3 * 3.75: 0.3 * 3 = 0.9, 0.3 * 0.75 = 0.225, so total is 1.125.So, 1.125 + 0.2x = 1.5Subtract 1.125 from both sides:0.2x = 1.5 - 1.125 = 0.375Therefore, x = 0.375 / 0.2 = 1.875 hours.Wait, 0.375 divided by 0.2 is 1.875. So, x is 1.875 hours.But let me check this with Equation 2 to make sure.Equation 2: 0.3667t - 0.2x = 1Plugging t = 3.75 and x = 1.875:0.3667 * 3.75 - 0.2 * 1.875Calculate each term:0.3667 * 3.75: Let's compute 0.3667 * 3 = 1.1001, and 0.3667 * 0.75 = 0.275025. Adding them together: 1.1001 + 0.275025 ≈ 1.3751250.2 * 1.875 = 0.375So, 1.375125 - 0.375 ≈ 1.000125, which is approximately 1. So, that checks out.Therefore, x is 1.875 hours, which is 1 hour and 52.5 minutes. But since the question asks for how many hours, we can express this as a fraction.1.875 hours is equal to 1 and 7/8 hours, because 0.875 is 7/8. Alternatively, as an improper fraction, 15/8 hours.Wait, 1.875 is 15/8? Let me check: 15 divided by 8 is 1.875. Yes, correct.So, x is 15/8 hours.But let me verify the entire process again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, I set V as the volume of pool N, so pool M is 1.5V.Pipe A's rate: 1.5V / 5 hours = 0.3V per hour.Pipe B's rate: V / 5 hours = 0.2V per hour.Pipe C's rate: V / 6 hours ≈ 0.1667V per hour.Then, for pool M, it's filled by A for t hours and B for x hours. So, total volume: 0.3V * t + 0.2V * x = 1.5V.Divide both sides by V: 0.3t + 0.2x = 1.5.For pool N, it's filled by C for t hours and B for (t - x) hours. So, total volume: 0.1667V * t + 0.2V * (t - x) = V.Divide by V: 0.1667t + 0.2(t - x) = 1.Which simplifies to 0.1667t + 0.2t - 0.2x = 1, so 0.3667t - 0.2x = 1.Adding the two equations:0.3t + 0.2x + 0.3667t - 0.2x = 1.5 + 1Which gives 0.6667t = 2.5, so t = 2.5 / 0.6667 ≈ 3.75 hours.Then, substituting back into the first equation:0.3 * 3.75 + 0.2x = 1.51.125 + 0.2x = 1.50.2x = 0.375x = 1.875 hours, which is 15/8 hours.So, yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, to avoid decimals, maybe I can represent everything in fractions.Let me try that.Given:Pool M: 1.5V = 3V/2Pipe A: 3V/2 divided by 5 hours = (3V)/10 per hour.Pipe B: V/5 per hour.Pipe C: V/6 per hour.For pool M:Volume filled by A in t hours: (3V/10) * tVolume filled by B in x hours: (V/5) * xTotal: (3V/10)t + (V/5)x = 3V/2Divide both sides by V:(3/10)t + (1/5)x = 3/2Multiply all terms by 10 to eliminate denominators:3t + 2x = 15Equation 1: 3t + 2x = 15For pool N:Volume filled by C in t hours: (V/6) * tVolume filled by B in (t - x) hours: (V/5)(t - x)Total: (V/6)t + (V/5)(t - x) = VDivide by V:(1/6)t + (1/5)(t - x) = 1Multiply all terms by 30 to eliminate denominators:5t + 6(t - x) = 30Expand:5t + 6t - 6x = 30Combine like terms:11t - 6x = 30Equation 2: 11t - 6x = 30Now, we have:Equation 1: 3t + 2x = 15Equation 2: 11t - 6x = 30Let me solve this system.From Equation 1: 3t + 2x = 15Let me solve for one variable. Let's solve for x.2x = 15 - 3tx = (15 - 3t)/2Now, substitute x into Equation 2:11t - 6*( (15 - 3t)/2 ) = 30Simplify:11t - 3*(15 - 3t) = 30Multiply out:11t - 45 + 9t = 30Combine like terms:(11t + 9t) - 45 = 3020t - 45 = 3020t = 75t = 75 / 20 = 15/4 = 3.75 hoursSo, t is 15/4 hours. Then, x is (15 - 3*(15/4))/2Compute 3*(15/4) = 45/4So, 15 - 45/4 = (60/4 - 45/4) = 15/4Therefore, x = (15/4)/2 = 15/8 hours.Which is 15/8 hours, which is 1.875 hours, same as before.So, that confirms the result.Therefore, the time that pipe B spends filling pool M is 15/8 hours, which is 1.875 hours.**Final Answer**The number of hours pipe (B) fills pool (M) is boxed{dfrac{15}{8}}."},{"question":"Aaron has some brothers.

With 300 people present during this period, the provisions used are 300 people multiplied by 30 days, totaling 9,000 person-days.Subtracting the consumed provisions from the total gives me the remaining provisions: 27,000 person-days minus 9,000 person-days equals 18,000 person-days.After 30 days, 100 people leave, leaving 200 people in the castle. To find out how many more days the remaining provisions will last, I divide the remaining provisions by the number of people: 18,000 person-days divided by 200 people equals 90 days.Therefore, the food will last for 90 more days after the 100 people leave."},{"question":"A quadratic function f(x) = x^2 - ax + b has one root in the interval [-1, 1] and another root in the interval [1, 2]. Find the minimum value of a - 2b.A. 0B. -1C. -2D. 1","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic function f(x) = x² - a x + b. It says that it has one root in the interval [-1, 1] and another root in [1, 2]. I need to find the minimum value of a - 2b. The options are A. 0, B. -1, C. -2, D. 1.Hmm, quadratic functions. I remember that a quadratic function has two roots, and the graph is a parabola. Since the coefficient of x² is positive (1), it opens upwards. So, the vertex is the minimum point.Given that one root is in [-1, 1] and another in [1, 2], that means the function crosses the x-axis once between -1 and 1, and once between 1 and 2. So, the roots are in these intervals.Let me denote the roots as r1 and r2, where r1 is in [-1, 1] and r2 is in [1, 2]. So, f(r1) = 0 and f(r2) = 0.From Vieta's formula, for a quadratic equation x² - a x + b = 0, the sum of the roots is a, and the product is b. So, r1 + r2 = a, and r1 * r2 = b.So, a = r1 + r2, and b = r1 * r2.Therefore, a - 2b = (r1 + r2) - 2*(r1 * r2).So, I need to express a - 2b in terms of r1 and r2, and then find its minimum value given that r1 ∈ [-1, 1] and r2 ∈ [1, 2].So, the problem reduces to minimizing the expression (r1 + r2) - 2*r1*r2, where r1 is between -1 and 1, and r2 is between 1 and 2.Let me denote this expression as E = r1 + r2 - 2 r1 r2.I need to find the minimum value of E given the constraints on r1 and r2.Hmm, how can I approach this? Maybe I can treat this as a function of two variables, r1 and r2, and find its minimum over the rectangle defined by r1 ∈ [-1,1] and r2 ∈ [1,2].Alternatively, perhaps I can fix one variable and express E in terms of the other, then find the minimum.Let me try that.First, let's fix r1 and express E as a function of r2:E(r2) = r1 + r2 - 2 r1 r2.This is linear in r2, so its minimum over r2 ∈ [1,2] will occur at one of the endpoints.Similarly, if I fix r2, E(r1) = r1 + r2 - 2 r1 r2, which is linear in r1, so its minimum over r1 ∈ [-1,1] will occur at one of the endpoints.Therefore, the minimum of E occurs at one of the four corners of the rectangle: (r1, r2) = (-1,1), (-1,2), (1,1), (1,2).So, let's compute E for each of these four points.1. At (-1,1):E = (-1) + 1 - 2*(-1)*(1) = (-1 + 1) - 2*(-1) = 0 + 2 = 2.2. At (-1,2):E = (-1) + 2 - 2*(-1)*(2) = (1) - 2*(-2) = 1 + 4 = 5.3. At (1,1):E = 1 + 1 - 2*(1)*(1) = 2 - 2 = 0.4. At (1,2):E = 1 + 2 - 2*(1)*(2) = 3 - 4 = -1.So, among these four points, the minimum value of E is -1, occurring at (1,2).Wait, but hold on. Is that the actual minimum? Because sometimes, the minimum could occur inside the domain, not just at the corners, especially if the function is non-linear. But in this case, E is linear in both variables, so the extrema should indeed occur at the corners.However, I should also check if the roots r1 and r2 can actually take these corner values. Because just because we have E evaluated at these points, we need to ensure that the quadratic function actually has roots in the specified intervals.Wait, for example, if r1 = 1 and r2 = 2, then the quadratic is (x - 1)(x - 2) = x² - 3x + 2. So, a = 3, b = 2, and a - 2b = 3 - 4 = -1, which is the value we found.Similarly, if r1 = -1 and r2 = 1, the quadratic is (x + 1)(x - 1) = x² - 1, so a = 0, b = -1, and a - 2b = 0 - (-2) = 2.But wait, in the problem statement, it says one root is in [-1,1] and another in [1,2]. So, if r1 = 1 and r2 = 2, then r1 is at the boundary of both intervals. Similarly, r1 = -1 is at the boundary of [-1,1]. So, are these considered valid?I think so, because the intervals are closed, so endpoints are included. So, r1 = 1 is in [-1,1], and r2 = 2 is in [1,2]. So, that should be acceptable.But let me think again. If I have r1 = 1 and r2 = 2, then the quadratic is x² - 3x + 2, which has roots at 1 and 2. So, 1 is in [-1,1] and 2 is in [1,2], so it satisfies the condition.Similarly, if r1 = -1 and r2 = 1, the quadratic is x² - 0x -1, which is x² -1, with roots at -1 and 1. So, -1 is in [-1,1], and 1 is in [1,2], so that also satisfies the condition.So, these are valid cases.But wait, is there a case where E could be lower than -1? Maybe if r1 is somewhere between -1 and 1, and r2 is somewhere between 1 and 2, but not at the endpoints.Wait, but since E is linear in both r1 and r2, the minimum must occur at a corner. So, I think -1 is indeed the minimum.But let me double-check.Alternatively, maybe I can use calculus to find the minimum.Express E as E(r1, r2) = r1 + r2 - 2 r1 r2.Compute partial derivatives:∂E/∂r1 = 1 - 2 r2.∂E/∂r2 = 1 - 2 r1.Set partial derivatives to zero:1 - 2 r2 = 0 => r2 = 1/2.1 - 2 r1 = 0 => r1 = 1/2.So, critical point at (1/2, 1/2). But wait, r1 is supposed to be in [-1,1] and r2 in [1,2]. So, r2 = 1/2 is not in [1,2], so the critical point is outside the domain.Therefore, the minimum must occur on the boundary. So, as I thought earlier, the minimum occurs at one of the four corners.So, the minimum value is -1, which is option B.But wait, hold on. Let me check another approach.Alternatively, since the quadratic has roots in [-1,1] and [1,2], we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem on the function f(x). Since it's continuous, if it has a root in [-1,1], then f(-1) and f(1) must have opposite signs or zero. Similarly, for the root in [1,2], f(1) and f(2) must have opposite signs or zero.So, let's compute f(-1), f(1), and f(2).f(-1) = (-1)^2 - a*(-1) + b = 1 + a + b.f(1) = 1 - a + b.f(2) = 4 - 2a + b.Since there is a root in [-1,1], f(-1) and f(1) must have opposite signs or one of them is zero.Similarly, since there is a root in [1,2], f(1) and f(2) must have opposite signs or one of them is zero.So, let's write down the inequalities.First, for the root in [-1,1]:f(-1) * f(1) ≤ 0.Similarly, for the root in [1,2]:f(1) * f(2) ≤ 0.So, let's compute these products.First, f(-1) = 1 + a + b.f(1) = 1 - a + b.So, f(-1)*f(1) = (1 + a + b)(1 - a + b).Similarly, f(1)*f(2) = (1 - a + b)(4 - 2a + b).So, both products must be ≤ 0.Let me compute f(-1)*f(1):(1 + a + b)(1 - a + b) = [1 + b]^2 - a^2.So, [1 + b]^2 - a^2 ≤ 0.Similarly, f(1)*f(2):(1 - a + b)(4 - 2a + b).Let me compute this:First, expand (1 - a + b)(4 - 2a + b):Multiply term by term:1*4 = 41*(-2a) = -2a1*b = b(-a)*4 = -4a(-a)*(-2a) = 2a²(-a)*b = -a bb*4 = 4bb*(-2a) = -2a bb*b = b²So, adding all together:4 - 2a + b - 4a + 2a² - a b + 4b - 2a b + b².Combine like terms:Constant term: 4.a terms: -2a -4a = -6a.b terms: b + 4b = 5b.a² term: 2a².ab terms: -a b - 2a b = -3a b.b² term: b².So, overall:2a² - 3a b + b² -6a +5b +4.So, f(1)*f(2) = 2a² - 3a b + b² -6a +5b +4 ≤ 0.So, now we have two inequalities:1. [1 + b]^2 - a^2 ≤ 0.2. 2a² - 3a b + b² -6a +5b +4 ≤ 0.We need to find the minimum of a - 2b, given these two inequalities.Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe I can express a in terms of b or vice versa.From the first inequality:[1 + b]^2 ≤ a².So, |a| ≥ 1 + b.But since a is the sum of the roots, which are r1 and r2, where r1 is in [-1,1] and r2 is in [1,2], so a = r1 + r2.So, the minimum value of a is when r1 is as small as possible and r2 is as small as possible. So, r1 = -1, r2 =1, so a = 0.The maximum value of a is when r1 =1 and r2=2, so a=3.So, a ∈ [0,3].Similarly, b = r1 * r2.So, since r1 ∈ [-1,1], r2 ∈ [1,2], the product b can be as low as -2 (when r1=-1, r2=2) and as high as 2 (when r1=1, r2=2).So, b ∈ [-2,2].But let's get back to the inequalities.First inequality: [1 + b]^2 ≤ a².So, 1 + 2b + b² ≤ a².Second inequality: 2a² - 3a b + b² -6a +5b +4 ≤ 0.So, maybe I can substitute a² from the first inequality into the second.From the first inequality, a² ≥ (1 + b)^2.So, in the second inequality, replace a² with (1 + b)^2:2*(1 + 2b + b²) - 3a b + b² -6a +5b +4 ≤ 0.Compute this:2 + 4b + 2b² - 3a b + b² -6a +5b +4 ≤ 0.Combine like terms:Constants: 2 + 4 = 6.b terms: 4b +5b = 9b.b² terms: 2b² + b² = 3b².a terms: -3a b -6a.So, overall:3b² + 9b +6 -3a b -6a ≤ 0.Factor out -3a:3b² + 9b +6 -3a(b + 2) ≤ 0.Hmm, not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps express a from the first inequality.From [1 + b]^2 ≤ a², so a ≥ |1 + b|.But since a is in [0,3], and 1 + b can be positive or negative.Wait, from a = r1 + r2, and r1 ∈ [-1,1], r2 ∈ [1,2], so a can be as low as 0 (r1=-1, r2=1) and as high as 3 (r1=1, r2=2). So, a is non-negative.Therefore, since a ≥ 0, and [1 + b]^2 ≤ a², so |1 + b| ≤ a.But a is non-negative, so 1 + b ≤ a, because if 1 + b is positive, then a ≥ 1 + b, and if 1 + b is negative, then a ≥ -(1 + b), but since a is non-negative, this is automatically satisfied.Wait, let's see:If 1 + b is positive, then a ≥ 1 + b.If 1 + b is negative, then a ≥ -(1 + b). But since a is non-negative, and -(1 + b) is positive only if 1 + b < 0, i.e., b < -1.So, in the case when b < -1, a must be ≥ -(1 + b). But since a is ≥0, and -(1 + b) is positive when b < -1.But let's think about the possible values of b.Earlier, I thought b ∈ [-2,2], but actually, since r1 ∈ [-1,1], r2 ∈ [1,2], so b = r1 * r2.So, the minimum value of b is when r1 = -1 and r2 =2, so b = -2.The maximum value is when r1=1 and r2=2, so b=2.So, b ∈ [-2,2].So, when b < -1, 1 + b < 0, so |1 + b| = -(1 + b). So, a ≥ -(1 + b).But since a is non-negative, and -(1 + b) is positive when b < -1, so a must be ≥ -(1 + b).But in that case, since a is non-negative, this is automatically satisfied if a ≥0 and -(1 + b) ≤ a.But perhaps it's better to split into cases.Case 1: b ≥ -1.Then, 1 + b ≥ 0, so a ≥ 1 + b.Case 2: b < -1.Then, 1 + b < 0, so a ≥ -(1 + b).But since a is non-negative, and -(1 + b) is positive in this case, so a must be ≥ -(1 + b).But let's see, in this case, b < -1, so -(1 + b) = -1 - b.But since b < -1, -1 - b > 0.So, a must be ≥ -1 - b.But since a is non-negative, and -1 - b is positive, so a must be ≥ -1 - b.But this is another inequality.So, perhaps I can write:If b ≥ -1, then a ≥ 1 + b.If b < -1, then a ≥ -1 - b.But in both cases, a is bounded below.So, perhaps I can express a in terms of b, and substitute into the second inequality.Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize b and express a accordingly.But this seems getting complicated.Alternatively, maybe I can use the expression E = a - 2b, and try to express it in terms of b.From the first inequality, a ≥ |1 + b|.But since a is non-negative, and E = a - 2b, perhaps I can express E in terms of b.But I'm not sure.Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill.Wait, perhaps I can consider E = a - 2b, and since a ≥ |1 + b|, so E ≥ |1 + b| - 2b.So, E ≥ |1 + b| - 2b.So, let's analyze |1 + b| - 2b.Case 1: 1 + b ≥ 0, i.e., b ≥ -1.Then, |1 + b| = 1 + b.So, E ≥ (1 + b) - 2b = 1 - b.So, E ≥ 1 - b.But since b ≥ -1, 1 - b can be as low as 1 - 2 = -1 (when b=2) and as high as 1 - (-1) = 2.But we are looking for the minimum E, so in this case, E ≥ 1 - b, which is minimized when b is as large as possible.Since b can be up to 2, so E ≥ 1 - 2 = -1.Case 2: 1 + b < 0, i.e., b < -1.Then, |1 + b| = -(1 + b).So, E ≥ -(1 + b) - 2b = -1 - b - 2b = -1 - 3b.So, E ≥ -1 - 3b.Since b < -1, let's see what is the minimum of E in this case.We have E ≥ -1 - 3b.Since b < -1, -3b > 3.So, -1 - 3b > -1 + 3 = 2.So, in this case, E ≥ something greater than 2.But since we're looking for the minimum E, which is lower in Case 1.Therefore, the minimal E occurs in Case 1, when b is as large as possible, i.e., b=2, giving E ≥ -1.But wait, is this tight? Because E can be equal to -1 when a =1 + b and E =1 - b.So, when a =1 + b, E = a - 2b = (1 + b) - 2b =1 - b.So, to have E = -1, we need 1 - b = -1 => b=2.So, when b=2, a=1 + b=3, so E=3 - 4= -1.Which is consistent with our earlier calculation.Therefore, the minimal value of E is -1.So, the answer is B.But wait, just to make sure, let me check if when b=2, the quadratic indeed has roots in the given intervals.When b=2, a=3, so the quadratic is x² -3x +2, which factors as (x-1)(x-2), so roots at 1 and 2. So, 1 is in [-1,1] and 2 is in [1,2]. So, it satisfies the condition.Therefore, the minimal value is indeed -1.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Compute tan 20^circ + 4 sin 20^circ.","answer":"Okay, so I need to compute the value of tan 20 degrees plus 4 times sin 20 degrees. Hmm, that seems like a trigonometric expression. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this or maybe use some trigonometric identities to make it easier to evaluate.First, let me write down the expression:tan 20° + 4 sin 20°I know that tan θ is equal to sin θ over cos θ, so maybe I can rewrite tan 20° in terms of sine and cosine. Let me try that:tan 20° = sin 20° / cos 20°So substituting that back into the original expression, we get:sin 20° / cos 20° + 4 sin 20°Hmm, both terms have sin 20°, so maybe I can factor that out. Let me see:sin 20° (1 / cos 20° + 4)That simplifies to:sin 20° (1 + 4 cos 20°) / cos 20°Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If I factor sin 20° out, then:sin 20° [1 / cos 20° + 4] = sin 20° [ (1 + 4 cos 20°) / cos 20° ]Yes, that seems correct. So now the expression is:sin 20° (1 + 4 cos 20°) / cos 20°Hmm, that might not be particularly helpful, but maybe I can compute the numerical values of sin 20°, cos 20°, and then plug them in.Alternatively, maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can help simplify this expression further. Let me think about some identities that involve tan and sin.I recall that tan θ can be expressed in terms of sine and cosine, which I already used. Maybe I can use some multiple-angle identities or sum formulas?Wait, another thought: sometimes expressions like this can be rewritten using sine addition formulas or something similar. Let me see.Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a single trigonometric function. Let me see if that's possible.Let me denote the expression as E:E = tan 20° + 4 sin 20°I can write this as:E = (sin 20° / cos 20°) + 4 sin 20°Let me combine the terms over a common denominator:E = [sin 20° + 4 sin 20° cos 20°] / cos 20°Factor sin 20° in the numerator:E = sin 20° (1 + 4 cos 20°) / cos 20°Hmm, same as before. Maybe I can compute the value numerically since it's just 20 degrees, which is a standard angle, but not one of the commonly memorized ones like 30°, 45°, or 60°. So perhaps I can use a calculator to approximate the value.But wait, the problem is asking to compute it, not necessarily to approximate. Maybe there's an exact value or a more simplified form. Let me think again.Alternatively, perhaps I can use some trigonometric identities to express this as a single sine or cosine function. For example, expressions of the form a sin θ + b cos θ can be written as R sin(θ + φ) or R cos(θ - φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.But in this case, the expression is tan θ + 4 sin θ, which is a bit different because of the tangent. Maybe I can express tan θ in terms of sine and cosine and then combine terms.Wait, let me try expressing tan 20° + 4 sin 20° as:sin 20° / cos 20° + 4 sin 20°Which is equal to:sin 20° (1 / cos 20° + 4)Alternatively, maybe I can factor out sin 20°:sin 20° (1 / cos 20° + 4) = sin 20° (sec 20° + 4)But I don't know if that helps. Maybe I can write this as:sin 20° * sec 20° + 4 sin 20° = tan 20° + 4 sin 20°Wait, that's just going back to the original expression. Maybe another approach.Let me consider that 20° is related to 60°, which is a common angle. Since 60° - 40° = 20°, but I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, 3*20°=60°, so maybe using triple angle identities?Let me recall the triple angle identity for sine:sin 3θ = 3 sin θ - 4 sin³ θSimilarly, for tangent, the triple angle identity is:tan 3θ = (3 tan θ - tan³ θ) / (1 - 3 tan² θ)But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Let me see.Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for sin(A + B). Let me think.Wait, another idea: perhaps express tan 20° in terms of sin and cos, and then combine the terms into a single fraction.So, tan 20° + 4 sin 20° = (sin 20° / cos 20°) + 4 sin 20°Let me write this as:(sin 20° + 4 sin 20° cos 20°) / cos 20°Factor sin 20°:sin 20° (1 + 4 cos 20°) / cos 20°Hmm, same as before. Maybe I can compute the numerator and denominator separately.Let me compute 1 + 4 cos 20°. I can calculate cos 20°, which is approximately 0.9397. So 4 * 0.9397 ≈ 3.7588. Then 1 + 3.7588 ≈ 4.7588.So the numerator is sin 20° * 4.7588, and the denominator is cos 20° ≈ 0.9397.So sin 20° ≈ 0.3420. So 0.3420 * 4.7588 ≈ let's compute that.0.3420 * 4 = 1.3680.3420 * 0.7588 ≈ approximately 0.3420 * 0.75 = 0.2565, and 0.3420 * 0.0088 ≈ 0.0030. So total ≈ 0.2565 + 0.0030 ≈ 0.2595So total numerator ≈ 1.368 + 0.2595 ≈ 1.6275Denominator ≈ 0.9397So E ≈ 1.6275 / 0.9397 ≈ approximately 1.733Wait, 1.6275 divided by 0.9397. Let me compute that more accurately.0.9397 * 1.733 ≈ 0.9397 * 1.7 = 1.5975, and 0.9397 * 0.033 ≈ 0.0310. So total ≈ 1.5975 + 0.0310 ≈ 1.6285, which is very close to the numerator 1.6275. So E ≈ 1.733.Wait, but 1.733 is approximately √3, which is about 1.732. So maybe the exact value is √3?Let me check: √3 ≈ 1.73205, which is very close to 1.733. So perhaps the exact value is √3. That would make sense because 20° is related to 60°, and √3 is a common value in trigonometry.Let me verify this by computing tan 20° + 4 sin 20° more accurately.First, compute tan 20°:tan 20° ≈ 0.3640Compute 4 sin 20°:sin 20° ≈ 0.3420, so 4 * 0.3420 ≈ 1.3680Add them together: 0.3640 + 1.3680 ≈ 1.7320Which is very close to √3 ≈ 1.73205. So it seems that tan 20° + 4 sin 20° equals √3.Wow, that's neat! So the exact value is √3. I didn't expect that, but the numerical approximation suggests it's exactly √3.Let me try to verify this algebraically to be sure.We want to show that tan 20° + 4 sin 20° = √3.Let me express tan 20° as sin 20° / cos 20°, so:sin 20° / cos 20° + 4 sin 20° = √3Multiply both sides by cos 20°:sin 20° + 4 sin 20° cos 20° = √3 cos 20°Factor sin 20° on the left:sin 20° (1 + 4 cos 20°) = √3 cos 20°Let me compute 1 + 4 cos 20°. As before, cos 20° ≈ 0.9397, so 4 * 0.9397 ≈ 3.7588, and 1 + 3.7588 ≈ 4.7588.So sin 20° * 4.7588 ≈ √3 cos 20°Compute sin 20° ≈ 0.3420, so 0.3420 * 4.7588 ≈ 1.6275Compute √3 cos 20° ≈ 1.73205 * 0.9397 ≈ 1.6275Yes, both sides are approximately equal, which suggests that the equality holds exactly.Therefore, tan 20° + 4 sin 20° = √3.So the exact value is √3.**Final Answer**The value of tan 20^circ + 4 sin 20^circ is boxed{sqrt{3}}."},{"question":"The sequence of numbers ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{2022} ) is such that ( a_{n} - a_{k} geq n^{3} - k^{3} ) for any ( n ) and ( k ) where ( 1 leq n leq 2022 ) and ( 1 leq k leq 2022 ). Furthermore, ( a_{1011} = 0 ). What values can ( a_{2022} ) take?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a sequence of numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2022} ). The conditions given are that for any ( n ) and ( k ) between 1 and 2022, the difference ( a_n - a_k ) is greater than or equal to ( n^3 - k^3 ). Additionally, we know that ( a_{1011} = 0 ). The question is asking what values ( a_{2022} ) can take.Hmm, let me try to unpack this. The inequality ( a_n - a_k geq n^3 - k^3 ) must hold for any ( n ) and ( k ). So, for any pair of indices, the difference in their ( a ) values is at least the difference in their cubes. That seems like a pretty strong condition. Maybe I can rearrange this inequality to get some useful information.Let me write the inequality again:( a_n - a_k geq n^3 - k^3 )If I rearrange this, I get:( a_n - n^3 geq a_k - k^3 )Wait, that's interesting. So, for any ( n ) and ( k ), ( a_n - n^3 ) is greater than or equal to ( a_k - k^3 ). That suggests that the expression ( a_i - i^3 ) is non-decreasing as ( i ) increases, right? Because if ( n > k ), then ( a_n - n^3 geq a_k - k^3 ). So, the sequence ( a_i - i^3 ) is non-decreasing.But actually, hold on. The inequality holds for any ( n ) and ( k ), regardless of which is larger. So, if ( n > k ), then ( a_n - n^3 geq a_k - k^3 ). Similarly, if ( k > n ), then ( a_k - k^3 geq a_n - n^3 ). So, actually, ( a_i - i^3 ) must be a constant sequence. Because if it's non-decreasing and non-increasing at the same time, it can't change—it has to be constant.Wait, is that right? Let me think. Suppose for some ( i ) and ( j ), ( a_i - i^3 ) is not equal to ( a_j - j^3 ). Without loss of generality, assume ( a_i - i^3 > a_j - j^3 ). Then, if ( i > j ), that's okay because the sequence is non-decreasing. But if ( i < j ), then it would violate the non-increasing condition. So, the only way for both conditions to hold is if all ( a_i - i^3 ) are equal. So, ( a_i - i^3 = c ) for some constant ( c ) and for all ( i ).Therefore, ( a_i = i^3 + c ). So, each term in the sequence is just its index cubed plus a constant. Now, we also know that ( a_{1011} = 0 ). Let's use that to find the constant ( c ).Plugging in ( i = 1011 ):( a_{1011} = (1011)^3 + c = 0 )So, ( c = - (1011)^3 ). Therefore, the general term is:( a_i = i^3 - (1011)^3 )So, ( a_{2022} = (2022)^3 - (1011)^3 ). Let me compute that.First, compute ( 2022^3 ). Hmm, 2022 is 2*1011, so ( 2022 = 2*1011 ). Therefore, ( 2022^3 = (2*1011)^3 = 8*(1011)^3 ). So,( a_{2022} = 8*(1011)^3 - (1011)^3 = 7*(1011)^3 )So, ( a_{2022} = 7*(1011)^3 ). Therefore, the only possible value ( a_{2022} ) can take is ( 7*(1011)^3 ).Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any other possibility? Because I assumed that ( a_i - i^3 ) is constant, but is that necessarily the case?Suppose I have two indices ( i ) and ( j ). From the inequality, ( a_i - a_j geq i^3 - j^3 ) and ( a_j - a_i geq j^3 - i^3 ). Adding these two inequalities together, we get ( 0 geq 0 ), which is always true. But individually, each inequality must hold. So, ( a_i - a_j geq i^3 - j^3 ) and ( a_j - a_i geq j^3 - i^3 ). The second inequality is just the negative of the first, so it's redundant. So, the first inequality must hold for all ( i, j ).But wait, if I fix ( j ) and vary ( i ), then ( a_i - i^3 geq a_j - j^3 ) for all ( i ). So, this suggests that ( a_i - i^3 ) is greater than or equal to ( a_j - j^3 ) for any ( i ). So, if I take ( j ) to be any index, then ( a_i - i^3 ) must be at least as big as ( a_j - j^3 ). So, the minimal value of ( a_i - i^3 ) is ( a_j - j^3 ) for any ( j ). But since this is true for any ( j ), the only way this can happen is if all ( a_i - i^3 ) are equal. Otherwise, if one is bigger, then for another ( j ), ( a_j - j^3 ) would have to be less than or equal to that, but since all must be greater than or equal to each other, they must all be equal.Therefore, yes, ( a_i - i^3 ) must be constant. So, my initial conclusion was correct. Therefore, ( a_{2022} = 7*(1011)^3 ).Just to make sure, let me compute ( 1011^3 ). Wait, 1011 is 1000 + 11, so:( 1011^3 = (1000 + 11)^3 = 1000^3 + 3*1000^2*11 + 3*1000*11^2 + 11^3 )Calculating each term:- ( 1000^3 = 1,000,000,000 )- ( 3*1000^2*11 = 3*1,000,000*11 = 33,000,000 )- ( 3*1000*11^2 = 3*1000*121 = 363,000 )- ( 11^3 = 1,331 )Adding them up:1,000,000,000 + 33,000,000 = 1,033,000,0001,033,000,000 + 363,000 = 1,033,363,0001,033,363,000 + 1,331 = 1,033,364,331So, ( 1011^3 = 1,033,364,331 )Therefore, ( 7*(1011)^3 = 7*1,033,364,331 ). Let me compute that:1,033,364,331 * 7:1,033,364,331 * 7:1,000,000,000 *7 = 7,000,000,00033,364,331 *7:33,000,000 *7 = 231,000,000364,331 *7 = 2,550,317So, adding up:7,000,000,000 + 231,000,000 = 7,231,000,0007,231,000,000 + 2,550,317 = 7,233,550,317So, ( a_{2022} = 7,233,550,317 ).Wait, but is that the only possible value? Let me think again. The problem says \\"what values can ( a_{2022} ) take?\\" So, is it possible that ( a_{2022} ) can be larger than this value? Or is this the minimal possible value?Wait, the inequality is ( a_n - a_k geq n^3 - k^3 ). So, if ( a_n - a_k ) is greater than or equal to ( n^3 - k^3 ), that doesn't necessarily mean it can't be larger. So, could ( a_{2022} ) be larger than ( 7*(1011)^3 )?Wait, but earlier, I concluded that ( a_i = i^3 + c ). So, if ( a_i - i^3 ) is constant, then ( a_{2022} ) is uniquely determined. So, is that the only possible value?Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption there. Let me think again.Suppose I have two indices, say ( n ) and ( k ). The inequality is ( a_n - a_k geq n^3 - k^3 ). So, if we rearrange, ( a_n - n^3 geq a_k - k^3 ). So, for any ( n ) and ( k ), ( a_n - n^3 geq a_k - k^3 ). So, if I fix ( k ) and vary ( n ), then ( a_n - n^3 ) is greater than or equal to ( a_k - k^3 ) for all ( n ). So, the minimal value of ( a_n - n^3 ) is ( a_k - k^3 ). But since this is true for any ( k ), the only way this can hold is if all ( a_n - n^3 ) are equal. Otherwise, if one is larger, then another would have to be smaller, which would violate the inequality.Therefore, ( a_n - n^3 ) must be constant for all ( n ). So, ( a_n = n^3 + c ). Therefore, ( a_{1011} = 1011^3 + c = 0 ) gives ( c = -1011^3 ). Therefore, ( a_n = n^3 - 1011^3 ). So, ( a_{2022} = 2022^3 - 1011^3 ).But wait, 2022 is 2*1011, so ( 2022^3 = (2*1011)^3 = 8*1011^3 ). Therefore, ( a_{2022} = 8*1011^3 - 1011^3 = 7*1011^3 ). So, that's the only possible value.Therefore, the value ( a_{2022} ) must take is ( 7*1011^3 ), which is 7,233,550,317.Wait, but let me check if there's any other way. Suppose ( a_n - n^3 ) is not constant, but just non-decreasing. But earlier, I thought that since for any ( n ) and ( k ), ( a_n - n^3 geq a_k - k^3 ) regardless of whether ( n > k ) or not, which would force all ( a_n - n^3 ) to be equal.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a function. Let me define ( b_n = a_n - n^3 ). Then, the condition is ( b_n geq b_k ) for any ( n ) and ( k ). So, ( b_n ) is greater than or equal to ( b_k ) for any ( n ) and ( k ). That can only happen if all ( b_n ) are equal. Because if, say, ( b_1 ) is greater than ( b_2 ), then ( b_2 ) must be less than ( b_1 ), which contradicts the condition that ( b_2 geq b_1 ). So, all ( b_n ) must be equal.Therefore, ( b_n = c ) for all ( n ), so ( a_n = n^3 + c ). Therefore, ( a_{1011} = 1011^3 + c = 0 ) implies ( c = -1011^3 ). So, ( a_n = n^3 - 1011^3 ). Therefore, ( a_{2022} = 2022^3 - 1011^3 = 7*1011^3 ).So, yeah, I think that's the only possible value. Therefore, ( a_{2022} ) must be ( 7*1011^3 ), which is 7,233,550,317.**Final Answer**The value ( a_{2022} ) can take is boxed{7233550317}."},{"question":"Sophia did push-ups every day for 7 days.

How many push-ups did Sophia do on the last day?(A) 55(B) 35(C) 50(D) 45(E) 40","answer":"First, I recognize that Sophia's push-ups form an arithmetic sequence where each day she does 5 more push-ups than the previous day.Let’s denote the number of push-ups she did on the first day as ( a ). Therefore, the number of push-ups on each subsequent day can be expressed as:- Day 1: ( a )- Day 2: ( a + 5 )- Day 3: ( a + 10 )- Day 4: ( a + 15 )- Day 5: ( a + 20 )- Day 6: ( a + 25 )- Day 7: ( a + 30 )The total number of push-ups over the 7 days is the sum of this arithmetic sequence. The formula for the sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:[S_n = frac{n}{2} times (2a + (n - 1)d)]where ( n = 7 ), ( d = 5 ), and ( S_7 = 175 ).Plugging in the values:[175 = frac{7}{2} times (2a + 30)]Simplifying:[175 = 7a + 105][70 = 7a][a = 10]So, Sophia did 10 push-ups on the first day.

Each screw needs to be paired with two nuts. How many workers should be assigned to produce screws and how many should be assigned to produce nuts in order to have a matching production each day?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a workshop with 22 workers producing screws and nuts. Each worker can make either 1200 screws or 2000 nuts per day. The goal is to figure out how many workers should be assigned to make screws and how many to make nuts so that the production is matched each day. Each screw needs two nuts, right? So, I need to make sure that the number of nuts produced is exactly twice the number of screws produced. Hmm, okay.Let me break this down. Let's say we have 's' workers making screws and 'n' workers making nuts. Since there are 22 workers in total, I can write the equation:s + n = 22That's straightforward. Now, each screw worker makes 1200 screws per day, so total screws produced would be 1200s. Similarly, each nut worker makes 2000 nuts per day, so total nuts produced would be 2000n. But we need the number of nuts to be twice the number of screws because each screw needs two nuts. So, the total nuts should equal 2 times the total screws. That gives me another equation:2000n = 2 * 1200sLet me write that out:2000n = 2 * 1200sSimplify the right side:2 * 1200s = 2400sSo now, the equation is:2000n = 2400sHmm, I can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 400 to make the numbers smaller. Let's see:2000 ÷ 400 = 52400 ÷ 400 = 6So, the equation becomes:5n = 6sOr, rearranged:5n = 6sWhich means n = (6/5)sOkay, so now I have two equations:1. s + n = 222. n = (6/5)sI can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for 's'. Let's do that.Substitute n with (6/5)s in the first equation:s + (6/5)s = 22Combine like terms. To add s and (6/5)s, I need a common denominator. s is the same as (5/5)s, so:(5/5)s + (6/5)s = (11/5)sSo,(11/5)s = 22To solve for 's', multiply both sides by 5/11:s = 22 * (5/11)Simplify 22 divided by 11 is 2, so:s = 2 * 5 = 10So, s = 10. That means 10 workers are assigned to produce screws.Now, substitute s = 10 back into the equation n = (6/5)s:n = (6/5)*10 = (6*10)/5 = 60/5 = 12So, n = 12. That means 12 workers are assigned to produce nuts.Let me double-check to make sure this makes sense. If 10 workers make screws, they produce 10 * 1200 = 12,000 screws per day. If 12 workers make nuts, they produce 12 * 2000 = 24,000 nuts per day. Now, each screw needs two nuts, so 12,000 screws would need 12,000 * 2 = 24,000 nuts. Perfect, that's exactly what we have. So, the numbers match up.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me verify each step.First, total workers: 10 + 12 = 22. Correct.Total screws: 10 * 1200 = 12,000. Correct.Total nuts: 12 * 2000 = 24,000. Correct.Nuts needed: 12,000 * 2 = 24,000. Correct.Everything checks out. So, the solution is 10 workers on screws and 12 on nuts.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It's always good to verify each step, especially when dealing with ratios and ensuring that the products can be paired correctly. In this case, the ratio of nuts to screws is 2:1, so the production rates need to reflect that. By setting up the equations and solving them, I arrived at the correct distribution of workers.Another way to think about it is to consider the production rates per worker. A screw worker produces 1200 screws, which would require 2400 nuts. A nut worker produces 2000 nuts. So, how many nut workers are needed to supply the nuts for one screw worker?For one screw worker, we need 2400 nuts. Since each nut worker makes 2000 nuts, the number of nut workers needed per screw worker is 2400 / 2000 = 1.2. So, for every screw worker, we need 1.2 nut workers. This ratio is the same as 6/5, which is what I had earlier. So, for every 5 screw workers, we need 6 nut workers. That's consistent with the previous result where s = 10 and n = 12, which is a ratio of 10:12 or 5:6 when simplified.So, this alternative way of thinking also leads me to the same conclusion. It reinforces that the distribution is correct.I think I'm confident with the answer now. It's always reassuring to approach the problem from different angles and arrive at the same solution.**Final Answer**The workshop should assign boxed{10} workers to produce screws and boxed{12} workers to produce nuts."},{"question":"In the complex plane, the points corresponding to the complex numbers ( z_1, z_2, z_3 ) are ( Z_1, Z_2, Z_3 ), respectively. Given that (left| z_1 right| = left| z_2 right| = sqrt{2}), (overrightarrow{OZ_1} cdot overrightarrow{OZ_2} = 0), and (left| z_1 + z_2 - z_3 right| = 2), find the range of the value of (left| z_3 right|).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about complex numbers in the plane. Let me try to parse it step by step.First, we're given three complex numbers: ( z_1, z_2, z_3 ). Their corresponding points in the complex plane are ( Z_1, Z_2, Z_3 ). The first piece of information is that the magnitudes of ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are both ( sqrt{2} ). So, ( |z_1| = |z_2| = sqrt{2} ). That means both ( Z_1 ) and ( Z_2 ) lie on a circle centered at the origin with radius ( sqrt{2} ).Next, it says that the dot product of vectors ( overrightarrow{OZ_1} ) and ( overrightarrow{OZ_2} ) is zero. In vector terms, if two vectors have a dot product of zero, they are perpendicular to each other. So, ( overrightarrow{OZ_1} ) is perpendicular to ( overrightarrow{OZ_2} ). Since these vectors correspond to the complex numbers ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ), this implies that ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are perpendicular in the complex plane.I remember that in complex numbers, if two numbers are perpendicular (i.e., their corresponding vectors are perpendicular), then one is a rotation of the other by 90 degrees, which can be represented by multiplying by ( i ) or ( -i ). So, ( z_2 ) could be ( i z_1 ) or ( -i z_1 ). But let me verify that.Wait, actually, the dot product being zero can also be expressed in terms of complex numbers. If ( overrightarrow{OZ_1} cdot overrightarrow{OZ_2} = 0 ), then in complex terms, this is equivalent to the real part of ( z_1 overline{z_2} ) being zero. Because the dot product of two vectors ( (a, b) ) and ( (c, d) ) is ( ac + bd ), which is the same as the real part of ( (a + ib)(c - id) ). So, ( text{Re}(z_1 overline{z_2}) = 0 ).Alternatively, since ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are perpendicular, the angle between them is 90 degrees, so ( z_2 = i z_1 ) or ( z_2 = -i z_1 ) up to a scalar multiple. But since their magnitudes are equal, ( |z_1| = |z_2| = sqrt{2} ), the scalar multiple must be 1. So, ( z_2 = i z_1 ) or ( z_2 = -i z_1 ).Let me write that down:Case 1: ( z_2 = i z_1 )Case 2: ( z_2 = -i z_1 )Okay, moving on. The next condition is ( |z_1 + z_2 - z_3| = 2 ). We need to find the range of ( |z_3| ).So, let's denote ( w = z_1 + z_2 - z_3 ). Then, ( |w| = 2 ). So, ( z_3 = z_1 + z_2 - w ). Therefore, ( |z_3| = |z_1 + z_2 - w| ). But since ( |w| = 2 ), ( w ) lies on a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.But perhaps a better approach is to consider ( z_3 ) in terms of ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ). Since ( |z_1 + z_2 - z_3| = 2 ), this implies that ( z_3 ) lies on a circle centered at ( z_1 + z_2 ) with radius 2.Therefore, the point ( Z_3 ) lies on a circle with center at ( Z_1 + Z_2 ) and radius 2. So, the magnitude ( |z_3| ) is the distance from the origin to a point on this circle. Therefore, the range of ( |z_3| ) will be from the minimum distance to the maximum distance from the origin to any point on this circle.To find this range, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a circle. The minimum distance is ( | |z_1 + z_2| - 2 | ) and the maximum distance is ( |z_1 + z_2| + 2 ). Therefore, the range of ( |z_3| ) is ( [ | |z_1 + z_2| - 2 |, |z_1 + z_2| + 2 ] ).So, the key is to find ( |z_1 + z_2| ). Let's compute that.Given that ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are perpendicular, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for complex numbers. Since ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are perpendicular, ( |z_1 + z_2|^2 = |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 ). Given ( |z_1| = |z_2| = sqrt{2} ), so ( |z_1|^2 = |z_2|^2 = 2 ). Therefore, ( |z_1 + z_2|^2 = 2 + 2 = 4 ), so ( |z_1 + z_2| = 2 ).Wait, that's interesting. So, ( |z_1 + z_2| = 2 ). Therefore, the center of the circle on which ( z_3 ) lies is at a distance of 2 from the origin, and the radius of the circle is also 2. So, the circle is centered at a point 2 units away from the origin, and has a radius of 2.Therefore, the minimum distance from the origin to any point on this circle is ( 2 - 2 = 0 ), and the maximum distance is ( 2 + 2 = 4 ). So, ( |z_3| ) can range from 0 to 4.But wait, let me think again. If the center is at distance 2 from the origin and the radius is 2, then the circle passes through the origin. So, the minimum distance is indeed 0, and the maximum is 4.However, let me verify this with another approach to make sure I haven't missed anything.Alternatively, we can represent ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) in terms of vectors. Since they are perpendicular and have the same magnitude, we can think of them as orthogonal vectors with length ( sqrt{2} ). So, without loss of generality, let me assign coordinates to ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ).Let me set ( z_1 = sqrt{2} ) (on the real axis) and ( z_2 = i sqrt{2} ) (on the imaginary axis). Then, ( z_1 + z_2 = sqrt{2} + i sqrt{2} ), which has magnitude ( sqrt{ (sqrt{2})^2 + (sqrt{2})^2 } = sqrt{2 + 2} = sqrt{4} = 2 ). So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.Therefore, ( z_3 ) lies on a circle centered at ( sqrt{2} + i sqrt{2} ) with radius 2. The distance from the origin to the center is 2, so the minimum distance from the origin to the circle is ( 2 - 2 = 0 ) and the maximum is ( 2 + 2 = 4 ).Wait, but is 0 achievable? That is, can ( z_3 ) be at the origin? Let's see.If ( z_3 = 0 ), then ( |z_1 + z_2 - z_3| = |z_1 + z_2| = 2 ), which is exactly the condition given. So, yes, ( z_3 ) can be 0, which is at the origin.Similarly, the maximum distance would be when ( z_3 ) is in the same direction as ( z_1 + z_2 ), so ( z_3 = z_1 + z_2 + 2 cdot frac{z_1 + z_2}{|z_1 + z_2|} ). Since ( |z_1 + z_2| = 2 ), this becomes ( z_1 + z_2 + (z_1 + z_2) = 2(z_1 + z_2) ). Therefore, ( |z_3| = |2(z_1 + z_2)| = 2 times 2 = 4 ).So, the maximum value of ( |z_3| ) is 4, and the minimum is 0.But wait, let me think again. Is this always the case regardless of the specific ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 )? Because I assumed ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) were on the real and imaginary axes, but they could be in any perpendicular directions.However, since ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are perpendicular and have the same magnitude, they form a rotated coordinate system. So, regardless of their specific orientation, the magnitude ( |z_1 + z_2| ) is always 2, as we saw earlier.Therefore, the circle on which ( z_3 ) lies is always centered at a point 2 units from the origin with radius 2, so the range of ( |z_3| ) is from 0 to 4.But just to make sure, let me consider another case where ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are not aligned with the axes.Suppose ( z_1 = 1 + i ) (since ( |1 + i| = sqrt{2} )), and ( z_2 = -1 + i ) (since ( |-1 + i| = sqrt{2} ) as well). Wait, but are these perpendicular?Let me check the dot product. The vectors corresponding to ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are ( (1, 1) ) and ( (-1, 1) ). The dot product is ( (1)(-1) + (1)(1) = -1 + 1 = 0 ). So yes, they are perpendicular.So, ( z_1 + z_2 = (1 + i) + (-1 + i) = 0 + 2i ). The magnitude of this is ( |0 + 2i| = 2 ). So again, the center is at a distance of 2 from the origin, and the radius is 2. So, the same conclusion holds: ( |z_3| ) ranges from 0 to 4.Therefore, regardless of the specific ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ), as long as they satisfy the given conditions, the range of ( |z_3| ) is from 0 to 4.Wait, but let me think about another scenario. Suppose ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are such that ( z_1 + z_2 ) is in a different direction. For example, suppose ( z_1 = sqrt{2} ) and ( z_2 = i sqrt{2} ), then ( z_1 + z_2 = sqrt{2} + i sqrt{2} ), which is at 45 degrees. The circle is centered there with radius 2.So, the distance from the origin to the center is 2, so the closest point on the circle is 0, and the farthest is 4.Alternatively, if ( z_1 + z_2 ) is in some other direction, say, along the real axis, then the circle is centered at (2, 0) with radius 2. So, the closest point is at (0,0), distance 0, and the farthest is at (4,0), distance 4.Similarly, if the center is at (0,2), the closest point is (0,0) and the farthest is (0,4). So, in all cases, the range is 0 to 4.Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude that the range of ( |z_3| ) is from 0 to 4.Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the triangle inequality.We have ( |z_3| = |z_1 + z_2 - w| ), where ( |w| = 2 ). So, using the triangle inequality:( | |z_1 + z_2| - |w| | leq |z_1 + z_2 - w| leq |z_1 + z_2| + |w| )Which gives:( |2 - 2| leq |z_3| leq 2 + 2 )So, ( 0 leq |z_3| leq 4 ). So, that confirms it.Therefore, the range of ( |z_3| ) is from 0 to 4.**Final Answer**The range of the value of ( |z_3| ) is boxed{[0, 4]}."},{"question":"The national football cup was played using a knockout system: the losing team was eliminated from the competition, and in case of a draw, a replay was scheduled. A total of (m) games were played, (n) of which were replays. How many teams participated in the cup?","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about a national football cup that uses a knockout system. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is asking how many teams participated in the cup, given that a total of ( m ) games were played, with ( n ) of those being replays. Hmm, okay.First, let me recall what a knockout system entails. In a knockout tournament, each game results in one team being eliminated. So, if there are ( k ) teams, the number of games needed to determine a winner is ( k - 1 ). That's because each game eliminates one team, and you need to eliminate all teams except one to have a champion. So, without any replays, the number of games would be straightforward.But wait, in this case, there are replays. Replays happen when a game ends in a draw, right? So, instead of declaring a winner, they schedule another game (a replay) between the same two teams. That means each replay essentially adds an extra game to the total count. So, if there are ( n ) replays, that means there were ( n ) games that ended in a draw, each requiring an additional game.Let me think about how this affects the total number of games. Normally, without replays, the total number of games would be ( k - 1 ). But with replays, each replay adds an extra game. So, the total number of games ( m ) would be equal to the number of games needed to eliminate all teams plus the number of replays. So, ( m = (k - 1) + n ). Is that right?Wait, hold on. Let me verify. Each replay is an additional game, so for each replay, you have two games instead of one. So, if there are ( n ) replays, that means there were ( n ) instances where a game was drawn and had to be replayed. So, each of those replays adds one extra game. Therefore, the total number of games is the number of games needed to eliminate all teams plus the number of replays. So, ( m = (k - 1) + n ). That seems correct.So, if I rearrange that equation to solve for ( k ), the number of teams, I get ( k = m - n + 1 ). Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me test this with a small example to see if it makes sense.Suppose there are 2 teams. Then, in a knockout, they play one game. If they draw, they replay. So, if they draw once, that's two games. So, total games ( m = 2 ), replays ( n = 1 ). According to the formula, ( k = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 ). That checks out.Another example: 4 teams. Normally, a knockout would require 3 games. If one of those games is a draw, leading to a replay, so total games would be 4. So, ( m = 4 ), ( n = 1 ). Plugging into the formula, ( k = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4 ). Perfect, that works.Wait, let me try a more complicated example. Suppose 8 teams. Without replays, 7 games. If two games are drawn, leading to two replays, so total games would be 7 + 2 = 9. So, ( m = 9 ), ( n = 2 ). Then, ( k = 9 - 2 + 1 = 8 ). That also works. Okay, so the formula seems consistent.But wait, let me think about how the replays affect the structure of the tournament. Each replay is essentially a replacement for a game that was drawn. So, does each replay replace a game or add to the total? Hmm, in reality, a replay is an additional game. So, for each replay, you have one more game than you would have otherwise. So, the total number of games is the number of games needed to eliminate all teams (which is ( k - 1 )) plus the number of replays ( n ). So, ( m = (k - 1) + n ), which gives ( k = m - n + 1 ).But wait, let me think again. Suppose in a tournament, each game that is a replay is just another game between the same two teams. So, for each replay, you have an extra game, but the number of eliminations remains the same. So, each replay doesn't eliminate any additional teams; it just adds an extra game to the total count. So, the number of eliminations is still ( k - 1 ), regardless of replays. Therefore, the number of games is ( (k - 1) + n ). So, yeah, the formula seems correct.Let me think about another angle. Each game, whether it's a regular game or a replay, results in one team being eliminated or a draw leading to a replay. Wait, no. A regular game results in one team being eliminated, but a replay is just another game between the same two teams, so it doesn't eliminate any new teams until someone wins. So, each replay is just an extra game without any additional eliminations.Therefore, the number of eliminations is still ( k - 1 ), and the number of games is ( (k - 1) + n ). So, solving for ( k ), we have ( k = m - n + 1 ). That seems consistent.But let me test it with another example. Let's say 3 teams. Wait, in a knockout tournament, 3 teams would require 2 games normally, right? Because the first game eliminates one team, then the remaining two play the final. But if the first game is a draw, they replay, so that's two games just to eliminate one team, and then the final. So, total games would be 3. So, ( m = 3 ), ( n = 1 ). Then, ( k = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3 ). That works.Wait, another example: 5 teams. Normally, a knockout tournament with 5 teams would require 4 games. But let's say two of those games are drawn, leading to two replays. So, total games would be 4 + 2 = 6. So, ( m = 6 ), ( n = 2 ). Then, ( k = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5 ). Perfect, that works too.So, it seems like the formula ( k = m - n + 1 ) holds true across these examples. Therefore, the number of teams that participated in the cup is ( m - n + 1 ).But just to make sure, let me think about the structure of the tournament. Each game, whether a regular game or a replay, is played between two teams. Each regular game eliminates one team, while a replay doesn't eliminate any team but just decides the winner of that particular match. So, the number of eliminations is still ( k - 1 ), regardless of the number of replays. Therefore, the total number of games is equal to the number of eliminations plus the number of replays. So, ( m = (k - 1) + n ), leading to ( k = m - n + 1 ).Yes, that makes sense. I think I've got it.**Final Answer**The number of teams that participated in the cup is boxed{m - n + 1}."},{"question":"Lei Lei went to buy instant noodles and handed the shopkeeper a 100-yuan note. After giving her the change, the shopkeeper said, \\"You only gave me 1 note, but I gave you 16 notes and instant noodles worth 5 yuan, you really earned a lot!\\" If the change given by the shopkeeper is either in 10-yuan notes or 5-yuan notes, how many of these 16 notes are 10-yuan notes?","answer":"First, let's define the variables. Let ( x ) represent the number of 10-yuan notes and ( y ) represent the number of 5-yuan notes given as change.We know that the total number of notes is 16, so:[x + y = 16]The total value of the change should be equal to the amount Lei Lei spent on the instant noodles, which is 95 yuan.

Find the remainder when  S  is divided by  1000 .","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of Euler's totient function φ(d) for all positive divisors d of 2008, and then find the remainder when that sum S is divided by 1000. Hmm, Euler's totient function... I remember it counts the number of integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. For example, φ(6) is 2 because only 1 and 5 are coprime to 6, and φ(10) is 4 because 1, 3, 7, and 9 are coprime to 10.First, I need to figure out all the positive divisors of 2008. To do that, I should factorize 2008 into its prime factors. Let me start by dividing 2008 by 2: 2008 ÷ 2 = 1004. Then, 1004 ÷ 2 = 502, and 502 ÷ 2 = 251. Now, 251 is a prime number because it doesn't divide by any primes up to its square root (which is around 15.8). So, 251 is prime. Therefore, the prime factorization of 2008 is 2³ × 251¹.Now, the number of positive divisors of a number is found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying those together. So, for 2008, the exponents are 3 and 1. Adding 1 to each gives 4 and 2, and multiplying 4 × 2 = 8. So, there are 8 positive divisors of 2008. Let me list them out:The divisors are all the products of the prime factors with exponents from 0 up to their maximum. So, for 2³, the exponents can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. For 251¹, the exponents can be 0 or 1. Thus, the divisors are:- 2⁰ × 251⁰ = 1- 2¹ × 251⁰ = 2- 2² × 251⁰ = 4- 2³ × 251⁰ = 8- 2⁰ × 251¹ = 251- 2¹ × 251¹ = 502- 2² × 251¹ = 1004- 2³ × 251¹ = 2008So, the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 251, 502, 1004, and 2008.Now, I need to compute φ(d) for each of these divisors and sum them up. Let's go one by one.1. φ(1): Hmm, φ(1) is a special case. Since there are no numbers less than 1, but by definition, φ(1) is 1 because the only number that is relatively prime to 1 is 1 itself. So, φ(1) = 1.2. φ(2): The numbers less than or equal to 2 are 1 and 2. The number 1 is coprime to 2, but 2 is not. So, φ(2) = 1.3. φ(4): Numbers less than or equal to 4 are 1, 2, 3, 4. The numbers coprime to 4 are 1 and 3. So, φ(4) = 2.4. φ(8): Numbers less than or equal to 8 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The numbers coprime to 8 are 1, 3, 5, 7. So, φ(8) = 4.5. φ(251): Since 251 is a prime number, φ(251) is 251 - 1 = 250.6. φ(502): 502 is 2 × 251. Since both 2 and 251 are primes, φ(502) = φ(2) × φ(251) = 1 × 250 = 250.7. φ(1004): 1004 is 4 × 251, which is 2² × 251. So, φ(1004) = φ(2²) × φ(251). φ(2²) is 2² - 2¹ = 4 - 2 = 2. So, φ(1004) = 2 × 250 = 500.8. φ(2008): 2008 is 8 × 251, which is 2³ × 251. So, φ(2008) = φ(2³) × φ(251). φ(2³) is 2³ - 2² = 8 - 4 = 4. So, φ(2008) = 4 × 250 = 1000.Now, let me list all these φ(d) values:- φ(1) = 1- φ(2) = 1- φ(4) = 2- φ(8) = 4- φ(251) = 250- φ(502) = 250- φ(1004) = 500- φ(2008) = 1000Now, let's sum them up:1 + 1 = 22 + 2 = 44 + 4 = 88 + 250 = 258258 + 250 = 508508 + 500 = 10081008 + 1000 = 2008Wait, so the sum S is 2008? That seems interesting. Is there a theorem that says that the sum of φ(d) over all divisors d of n is equal to n? Let me recall... Yes, I think that's a property of Euler's totient function. Specifically, for any positive integer n, the sum of φ(d) over all divisors d of n is equal to n. So, in this case, since n is 2008, the sum S should indeed be 2008. That's a nice shortcut!But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations, let me verify the sum step by step:1 (φ(1)) + 1 (φ(2)) = 22 + 2 (φ(4)) = 44 + 4 (φ(8)) = 88 + 250 (φ(251)) = 258258 + 250 (φ(502)) = 508508 + 500 (φ(1004)) = 10081008 + 1000 (φ(2008)) = 2008Yes, that adds up correctly. So, S = 2008.Now, the problem asks for the remainder when S is divided by 1000. So, 2008 divided by 1000 is 2 with a remainder of 8. Therefore, the remainder is 8.Wait, let me confirm that division: 1000 × 2 = 2000, and 2008 - 2000 = 8. So, yes, the remainder is 8.So, the answer is 8.But just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes in my reasoning, let me go through it again.First, factorizing 2008: 2008 ÷ 2 = 1004, ÷2 again is 502, ÷2 again is 251, which is prime. So, 2008 = 2³ × 251¹. The number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1)=8, which we listed as 1, 2, 4, 8, 251, 502, 1004, 2008.Then, calculating φ(d) for each:- φ(1) = 1- φ(2) = 1- φ(4) = 2- φ(8) = 4- φ(251) = 250- φ(502) = 250- φ(1004) = 500- φ(2008) = 1000Summing these gives 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 250 + 250 + 500 + 1000. Let's add them in a different order to check:1 + 1 = 22 + 2 = 44 + 4 = 88 + 250 = 258258 + 250 = 508508 + 500 = 10081008 + 1000 = 2008Yep, same result. So, S = 2008.2008 divided by 1000 is 2 with a remainder of 8. So, 2008 mod 1000 is 8.Therefore, the remainder is 8.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning.**Final Answer**boxed{8}"},{"question":"(The full score for this question is 15 points) When the purchase price of a product is 80 yuan and it is sold for 90 yuan each, 400 units can be sold. It is known that for every 1 yuan increase in price, the sales volume decreases by 10 units. To achieve the maximum profit, what should be the selling price per unit?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here about maximizing profit by adjusting the selling price of a product. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out the optimal selling price that will give the maximum profit. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding the given information.First, the purchase price is 80 yuan per unit. That means each unit costs 80 yuan to buy. The selling price is initially set at 90 yuan, and at that price, they can sell 400 units. Now, for every 1 yuan increase in the price, the sales volume decreases by 10 units. So, if they raise the price by 1 yuan to 91 yuan, they'll sell 390 units instead of 400. Conversely, if they lower the price by 1 yuan, they might sell more, but since we're looking to maximize profit, I think increasing the price might be the way to go, but I need to verify that.Okay, so the goal is to find the selling price that maximizes profit. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. Total revenue is the selling price multiplied by the number of units sold, and total cost is the purchase price multiplied by the number of units sold. So, profit = (Selling Price - Purchase Price) * Number of Units Sold.Let me denote the number of 1 yuan increases as x. So, if x is the number of times we increase the price by 1 yuan, then the new selling price will be 90 + x yuan. Similarly, the number of units sold will decrease by 10 units for each increase, so the new quantity sold will be 400 - 10x units.Wait, let me make sure I got that right. If x is the number of 1 yuan increases, then yes, selling price becomes 90 + x, and quantity sold becomes 400 - 10x. That seems correct.So, profit (P) can be expressed as:P = (Selling Price - Purchase Price) * Quantity SoldP = (90 + x - 80) * (400 - 10x)Simplify that:P = (10 + x) * (400 - 10x)Let me compute that expression:First, multiply 10 by 400: 10*400 = 4000Then, 10 by -10x: 10*(-10x) = -100xThen, x by 400: x*400 = 400xThen, x by -10x: x*(-10x) = -10x²So, putting it all together:P = 4000 - 100x + 400x - 10x²Combine like terms:-100x + 400x = 300xSo, P = 4000 + 300x - 10x²Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in terms of x. To find the maximum profit, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this quadratic function. Since the coefficient of x² is negative (-10), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.The general form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c, and the x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/(2a). In this case, a = -10, b = 300.So, x = -b/(2a) = -300/(2*(-10)) = -300/(-20) = 15.So, x = 15. That means we should increase the price by 15 yuan. Therefore, the optimal selling price is 90 + 15 = 105 yuan.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the profit equation:P = (10 + x)(400 - 10x)Expanding it:10*400 = 400010*(-10x) = -100xx*400 = 400xx*(-10x) = -10x²So, P = 4000 - 100x + 400x -10x²Combine like terms:-100x + 400x = 300xSo, P = 4000 + 300x -10x²Yes, that's correct.Then, to find the maximum, take the derivative with respect to x and set it to zero.dP/dx = 300 - 20xSet to zero:300 - 20x = 020x = 300x = 15Same result. So, x = 15 is correct.Therefore, the optimal selling price is 90 + 15 = 105 yuan.Wait a second, let me think about this again. If we increase the price by 15 yuan, the quantity sold will decrease by 10*15 = 150 units. So, the new quantity sold is 400 - 150 = 250 units.Let me compute the profit at this point.Profit = (105 - 80) * 250 = 25 * 250 = 6250 yuan.Is that the maximum? Let me check the profit at x = 14 and x = 16 to see if it's indeed a maximum.At x = 14:Selling price = 90 +14 = 104 yuanQuantity sold = 400 -140 = 260 unitsProfit = (104 -80)*260 = 24*260 = 6240 yuanAt x = 16:Selling price = 90 +16 = 106 yuanQuantity sold = 400 -160 = 240 unitsProfit = (106 -80)*240 = 26*240 = 6240 yuanSo, at x =14 and x=16, the profit is 6240, which is less than 6250 at x=15. So, yes, x=15 gives the maximum profit.Just to be thorough, let me check x=15.5, halfway between 15 and 16, just to see.But wait, x has to be an integer because we can't increase the price by half a yuan in this context, right? Or can we? The problem doesn't specify that x has to be an integer. Hmm, that's a good point.Wait, if x can be a non-integer, then the maximum occurs at x=15, which is an integer. But if x can be a non-integer, then the maximum is at x=15, which is already an integer, so it doesn't matter.But just in case, let me compute the profit at x=15.5.Selling price =90 +15.5=105.5 yuanQuantity sold=400 -10*15.5=400 -155=245 unitsProfit=(105.5 -80)*245=25.5*245Let me compute that:25*245=61250.5*245=122.5Total profit=6125 +122.5=6247.5 yuanWhich is less than 6250. So, even if we consider x=15.5, the profit is still less than at x=15. So, x=15 is indeed the maximum.Therefore, the optimal selling price is 105 yuan.Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to model this? Maybe using calculus or completing the square?Well, I used calculus earlier, taking the derivative and setting it to zero, which gave me x=15. Alternatively, completing the square for the quadratic equation.Let me try that.We have P = -10x² + 300x + 4000Let me write it as:P = -10(x² - 30x) + 4000To complete the square inside the parentheses:Take half of 30, which is 15, square it, which is 225.So,P = -10[(x² -30x +225) -225] +4000= -10[(x -15)² -225] +4000= -10(x -15)² +2250 +4000= -10(x -15)² +6250So, the maximum profit is 6250 yuan when x=15, which confirms our earlier result.Therefore, the optimal selling price is 90 +15=105 yuan.Just to make sure, let me also compute the profit at x=15, which is 6250, and see if that's indeed the maximum.Yes, as we saw earlier, at x=14 and x=16, the profit is 6240, which is less. So, 6250 is the maximum.Therefore, the answer should be 105 yuan per unit.**Final Answer**The selling price per unit should be boxed{105} yuan to achieve maximum profit."},{"question":"Two squares are drawn inside a regular hexagon with side-length 2. What is the area of the overlap of the two squares?A) 2  B) (2 - sqrt{3})  C) (4 - sqrt{3})  D) (4 - 2sqrt{3})  E) (8 - 4sqrt{3})","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where two squares are drawn inside a regular hexagon with side length 2, and I need to find the area of their overlap. The options are given, so that might help if I get stuck, but I want to figure it out step by step.First, let me visualize a regular hexagon. It has six equal sides and six equal angles. Each internal angle is 120 degrees. Since the side length is 2, each side is 2 units long. Now, inside this hexagon, two squares are drawn. I need to figure out where these squares are placed and how they overlap.I remember that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length 2. Maybe that can help me figure out the dimensions or positions of the squares.Wait, if the hexagon is regular, it's symmetric, so maybe the squares are placed symmetrically as well. Perhaps each square is aligned with two opposite sides of the hexagon? Or maybe they are rotated relative to each other?Let me think. If I place a square inside a regular hexagon, the square's sides can't be longer than the distance between two opposite sides of the hexagon. What's the distance between two opposite sides of a regular hexagon with side length 2?I recall that the distance between two opposite sides (the height) of a regular hexagon is ( 2 times text{side length} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ). So that would be ( 2 times 2 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2sqrt{3} ). So the height is ( 2sqrt{3} ). Hmm, so if the square is inscribed inside the hexagon, its side length can't exceed this height, but wait, the height is about 3.464, which is more than 2, so maybe the squares are placed such that their sides are aligned with the sides of the hexagon.Alternatively, perhaps the squares are rotated 30 degrees relative to the hexagon's sides? That might make sense because the hexagon has angles of 120 degrees, so a square could fit in a way that each corner touches a side of the hexagon.Wait, maybe I should draw a regular hexagon and try to sketch squares inside it. Since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.Let me consider the coordinates. Maybe placing the hexagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin. Then, the hexagon can be represented with vertices at (2,0), (1, √3), (-1, √3), (-2,0), (-1, -√3), (1, -√3). So each vertex is 2 units from the center.If I place a square inside this hexagon, how big can the square be? The maximum square that can fit inside a regular hexagon would have its vertices touching the midpoints of the hexagon's sides.Wait, but the side length of the hexagon is 2, so the distance from the center to a vertex is 2. The distance from the center to the midpoint of a side is ( sqrt{3} ) because in a regular hexagon, the apothem (distance from center to midpoint of a side) is ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times text{side length} ), which is ( sqrt{3} ).So, if I place a square such that its vertices are at the midpoints of the hexagon's sides, the square would have its corners at (1, √3), (-1, √3), (-1, -√3), (1, -√3). Wait, but that's actually a rectangle, not a square, because the width is 2 units and the height is ( 2sqrt{3} ) units. So that can't be a square.Hmm, maybe the squares are placed differently. Maybe each square is aligned with two opposite sides of the hexagon. For example, one square is aligned horizontally, and the other is rotated by 60 degrees or something.Wait, another approach: maybe each square is inscribed in the hexagon such that each side of the square touches two sides of the hexagon. Let me try to figure out the side length of such a square.If I have a square inside a regular hexagon, each side of the square will intersect two sides of the hexagon. Let me consider the geometry.Let me think of the regular hexagon as being composed of six equilateral triangles, each with side length 2. So, each triangle has sides of length 2, and the central angles are 60 degrees.If I place a square inside this hexagon, perhaps each corner of the square touches a side of the hexagon. Let me try to model this.Let me consider one of the squares. Let's say it's centered at the origin, and its sides are not aligned with the hexagon's sides. Instead, it's rotated by some angle θ. The square will have four vertices, each touching a side of the hexagon.Wait, maybe it's better to use coordinate geometry here. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices as I did before: (2,0), (1, √3), (-1, √3), (-2,0), (-1, -√3), (1, -√3).Now, suppose I have a square inside this hexagon. Let me assume that the square is axis-aligned, meaning its sides are parallel to the x and y axes. Then, its top and bottom sides would be horizontal, and its left and right sides vertical.But wait, the hexagon is symmetric, so maybe the square is placed such that its top and bottom sides are touching the top and bottom sides of the hexagon. But the top and bottom sides of the hexagon are horizontal lines at y = √3 and y = -√3.Wait, but the distance between these two lines is 2√3, which is about 3.464. If the square is placed inside, its height can't exceed this. But the side length of the square would then be 2√3, but that can't be because the width of the hexagon is 4 (from x = -2 to x = 2). So a square of side length 2√3 would have a width of 2√3, which is less than 4, so maybe that's possible.Wait, but the square can't extend beyond the hexagon's boundaries. So if the square is axis-aligned, its top and bottom would be at y = a and y = -a, and its left and right sides at x = b and x = -b. The square must fit within the hexagon, so the points (b, a), (-b, a), etc., must lie inside the hexagon.Wait, but the hexagon's sides are at 60-degree angles, so the square's corners may not lie on the hexagon's sides. Maybe the square is placed such that its sides are touching the midpoints of the hexagon's sides.Wait, the midpoints of the hexagon's sides are at (1.5, (√3)/2), (-1.5, (√3)/2), etc. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the square is placed such that each of its sides touches two sides of the hexagon.Alternatively, maybe each square is placed such that its vertices lie on the hexagon's vertices. But a regular hexagon has six vertices, so a square can't have all four vertices on the hexagon's vertices unless it's a smaller square inside.Wait, maybe each square is placed such that two of its vertices are on two opposite vertices of the hexagon, and the other two vertices are on adjacent vertices. Hmm, not sure.Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the maximum square that can fit inside the hexagon. The maximum square would have its sides aligned with the hexagon's sides.Wait, but the hexagon's sides are at 60 degrees relative to each other, so a square can't be aligned with all of them. Maybe the square is placed such that its sides are aligned with two opposite sides of the hexagon.Wait, let me think again. If I have a regular hexagon with side length 2, and I place a square inside it such that two adjacent sides of the square lie along two adjacent sides of the hexagon. Then, the square would extend towards the center of the hexagon.Wait, but the hexagon's internal angle is 120 degrees, so the square's corner would have to fit into that angle. The square's corner is 90 degrees, so maybe it can fit.Wait, let me try to model this. Suppose I place one square such that its bottom side is along the bottom side of the hexagon, from (1, -√3) to (1, √3). Wait, no, that's the vertical side. Wait, the hexagon's sides are not vertical or horizontal except for the ones at 0, 60, 120, etc., degrees.Wait, maybe I should use coordinate geometry. Let me place the hexagon with its center at (0,0), and one vertex at (2,0). Then, the adjacent vertices are at (1, √3), (-1, √3), (-2,0), (-1, -√3), (1, -√3), and back to (2,0).Now, suppose I place a square inside this hexagon. Let me assume that one side of the square lies along the bottom side of the hexagon, from (1, -√3) to (1, √3). Wait, no, that's a vertical line, but the hexagon's bottom side is actually from (1, -√3) to (2,0) to (1, √3). Wait, no, actually, each side of the hexagon is a straight line between two adjacent vertices.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the squares are placed such that their sides are aligned with the hexagon's axes. Let me think about the diagonals of the hexagon.Wait, another idea: the regular hexagon can be divided into a rectangle in the center and two equilateral triangles on the top and bottom. The rectangle would have a width of 2 and a height of 2√3, but that's the same as the distance between two opposite sides. Wait, no, the width would actually be 4 because from x = -2 to x = 2, that's 4 units. Wait, no, the distance between two opposite sides is 2√3, but the width along the x-axis is 4 units.Wait, maybe the squares are placed such that their sides are aligned with this width and height. So, one square is placed horizontally, spanning from left to right, and another is placed vertically, spanning from top to bottom.Wait, but the height of the hexagon is 2√3, which is about 3.464, so a square with side length 2√3 would have a width of 2√3, which is less than 4, so it could fit. But then, the square placed vertically would have a height of 2√3, which is the same as the hexagon's height.Wait, but if I place a square with side length 2√3 inside the hexagon, its corners would extend beyond the hexagon's sides because the hexagon's width is 4, but the square's width is 2√3 ≈ 3.464, which is less than 4, so maybe it fits.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should calculate the maximum possible square that can fit inside the hexagon.Alternatively, perhaps each square is placed such that its sides are at 30 degrees relative to the hexagon's sides. That might allow the square to fit snugly inside.Wait, maybe I should consider the intersection points of the squares and the hexagon. Let me try to find the coordinates where the square's sides intersect the hexagon's sides.Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each square is placed such that their sides are aligned with the hexagon's axes, but rotated by 30 degrees. So, one square is rotated 30 degrees clockwise, and the other is rotated 30 degrees counterclockwise, creating an overlapping area in the center.Wait, that might make sense. So, each square is placed at a 30-degree angle relative to the hexagon's sides, and their overlapping area is the region where both squares cover the same space.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to find the coordinates of the squares and then compute the overlapping area.Let me try to model one square. Suppose I place a square inside the hexagon such that its center is at the origin, and it's rotated by 30 degrees. The square's vertices would then lie somewhere on the hexagon's sides.Wait, the square's vertices would lie on the hexagon's sides, so I can find their coordinates by solving where the square's edges intersect the hexagon's edges.Alternatively, maybe the square is placed such that its sides are tangent to the hexagon's sides. Hmm, not sure.Wait, perhaps I should consider the distance from the center to the square's sides. Since the square is rotated, the distance from the center to each side of the square would be the same.Wait, the distance from the center to a side of the square is equal to (s/2) * cos(θ), where s is the side length of the square and θ is the angle between the square's side and the line from the center to the midpoint of that side.Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use the formula for the area of overlap between two squares.Wait, but I don't know the side lengths of the squares yet. Maybe I can find that first.Wait, perhaps the squares are both of side length 2, same as the hexagon's side length. But that might not fit because the hexagon's internal dimensions are larger.Wait, no, the side length of the hexagon is 2, but the squares inside can't have sides longer than the distance between two opposite sides, which is 2√3, as I calculated earlier.Wait, maybe each square has a side length of 2, same as the hexagon. Let me see if that's possible.If I place a square with side length 2 inside the hexagon, its diagonal would be 2√2, which is about 2.828. Since the hexagon's height is 2√3 ≈ 3.464, which is larger than 2√2, so maybe the square can fit.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the squares are placed such that their sides are aligned with the hexagon's sides, but offset.Wait, perhaps I should consider that each square is placed such that two of its vertices lie on two adjacent vertices of the hexagon, and the other two vertices lie on the midpoints of the opposite sides.Wait, let me try to model this. Suppose one square has vertices at (2,0), (1, √3), (-1, √3), and (-2,0). Wait, but that's actually a rectangle, not a square, because the distance between (2,0) and (1, √3) is √[(2-1)^2 + (0 - √3)^2] = √[1 + 3] = √4 = 2. Similarly, the distance between (1, √3) and (-1, √3) is 2 units. So, actually, that is a square with side length 2. Wait, no, because the sides are not all equal. Wait, the distance between (2,0) and (1, √3) is 2, and between (1, √3) and (-1, √3) is 2 units as well, but the distance between (-1, √3) and (-2,0) is also 2, and between (-2,0) and (2,0) is 4 units. Wait, no, that can't be a square because the sides are not all equal. So that's a rectangle, not a square.Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me calculate the distances again.From (2,0) to (1, √3): √[(2-1)^2 + (0 - √3)^2] = √[1 + 3] = 2.From (1, √3) to (-1, √3): √[(1 - (-1))^2 + (√3 - √3)^2] = √[4 + 0] = 2.From (-1, √3) to (-2,0): √[(-1 - (-2))^2 + (√3 - 0)^2] = √[1 + 3] = 2.From (-2,0) to (2,0): √[(-2 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = √[16 + 0] = 4.Wait, so three sides are length 2, and one side is length 4. That's not a square, that's a rectangle. So my initial thought was wrong.Wait, maybe the square is placed such that all four vertices lie on the hexagon's sides, but not necessarily on the vertices.Let me consider that. Suppose the square is placed inside the hexagon such that each of its four sides intersects two sides of the hexagon. Let me try to find the coordinates of such a square.Let me assume the square is centered at the origin and rotated by 45 degrees. Wait, but the hexagon's sides are at 60 degrees, so maybe the square is rotated by 30 degrees.Wait, perhaps I should use parametric equations for the sides of the hexagon and the square and find their intersection points.Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.Wait, another idea: the area of overlap between two squares can be found if I know the side lengths of the squares and the angle between them. But I don't know the side lengths or the angle yet.Wait, but maybe both squares have the same side length, and they are rotated relative to each other by 60 degrees, which is the angle between adjacent sides of the hexagon.Wait, if that's the case, then the overlapping area can be calculated using some formula involving the side lengths and the angle between them. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.Wait, maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular octagon or something similar, but I'm not sure.Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the coordinates again. Let me place the first square with its sides aligned along the x and y axes, centered at the origin. So its vertices would be at (a, a), (-a, a), (-a, -a), (a, -a), where 'a' is half the side length.Similarly, the second square is rotated by 60 degrees relative to the first one. So its vertices would be at (b,0), (0,b), (-b,0), (0,-b), but rotated by 60 degrees.Wait, no, when you rotate a square by 60 degrees, its vertices don't lie on the axes. Maybe I should use rotation matrices to find the coordinates.Wait, let me denote the first square as Square 1, with vertices at (s/2, s/2), (-s/2, s/2), (-s/2, -s/2), (s/2, -s/2), where 's' is the side length.Now, Square 2 is rotated by 60 degrees around the origin. So its vertices would be transformed by the rotation matrix:x' = x cos θ - y sin θy' = x sin θ + y cos θWhere θ = 60 degrees, so cos θ = 0.5, sin θ = (√3)/2.So, applying this to each vertex of Square 1:For vertex (s/2, s/2):x' = (s/2)(0.5) - (s/2)(√3/2) = (s/4) - (s√3)/4y' = (s/2)(√3/2) + (s/2)(0.5) = (s√3)/4 + s/4Similarly, for (-s/2, s/2):x' = (-s/2)(0.5) - (s/2)(√3/2) = (-s/4) - (s√3)/4y' = (-s/2)(√3/2) + (s/2)(0.5) = (-s√3)/4 + s/4And so on for the other vertices.But I'm not sure if this helps me find the overlapping area. Maybe I need to find the intersection points between Square 1 and Square 2.Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that both squares are inscribed in the hexagon, each rotated by 30 degrees relative to the hexagon's sides. Then, their overlapping area would be a smaller regular polygon.Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach.Wait, another idea: the regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length 2. The area of the hexagon is (3√3 * s²)/2, which with s=2, is (3√3 *4)/2 = 6√3.Now, if two squares are inscribed inside, their overlapping area would be a portion of this.Wait, but I don't know the area of the squares yet. Maybe each square has an area of 4, since the side length is 2, but that might not be the case.Wait, no, the side length of the squares isn't necessarily 2. They could be smaller.Wait, perhaps the squares are placed such that their sides are equal to the distance between two opposite sides of the hexagon, which is 2√3. So each square would have a side length of 2√3, but that would make their area (2√3)^2 = 12, which is larger than the hexagon's area of 6√3 ≈ 10.392. So that can't be.Wait, so maybe the squares are smaller. Let me think again.Wait, maybe each square has a side length of 2, same as the hexagon's side length. Then, their area would be 4 each, and the overlapping area would be something less.Wait, but how would a square with side length 2 fit inside the hexagon? The hexagon's width is 4, so a square of side length 2 could fit without any problem, but maybe it's placed such that its sides are aligned with the hexagon's sides.Wait, perhaps the two squares are placed such that each is rotated by 30 degrees relative to each other, creating an overlapping region in the center.Wait, maybe the overlapping area is a regular octagon, but I'm not sure.Wait, perhaps I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular hexagon itself, but smaller.Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe I should try to find the coordinates of the squares and compute the overlapping area.Let me try to define Square 1 with vertices at (1, √3), ( -1, √3), (-1, -√3), (1, -√3). Wait, but that's a rectangle, not a square. Wait, no, the distance between (1, √3) and (-1, √3) is 2 units, and between (-1, √3) and (-1, -√3) is 2√3 units. So that's a rectangle with sides 2 and 2√3, not a square.Wait, maybe I should scale it down. Suppose the square has side length 'a', and it's placed such that its sides are at 30 degrees relative to the hexagon's sides.Wait, perhaps I can model the square as being rotated by 30 degrees, so that its sides are aligned with the hexagon's diagonals.Wait, let me try to find the maximum square that can fit inside the hexagon when rotated by 30 degrees.The maximum square would have its corners touching the midpoints of the hexagon's sides.Wait, the midpoints of the hexagon's sides are at (2*cos(0°), 2*sin(0°)) = (2,0), (2*cos(60°), 2*sin(60°)) = (1, √3), (2*cos(120°), 2*sin(120°)) = (-1, √3), (2*cos(180°), 2*sin(180°)) = (-2,0), (2*cos(240°), 2*sin(240°)) = (-1, -√3), (2*cos(300°), 2*sin(300°)) = (1, -√3).Wait, so the midpoints are at (2,0), (1, √3), (-1, √3), (-2,0), (-1, -√3), (1, -√3).Wait, if I place a square such that its four corners are at four of these midpoints, but that would require four midpoints, but the midpoints are every 60 degrees, so a square would need four points spaced 90 degrees apart, which doesn't align with the hexagon's midpoints.Wait, maybe the square's corners are not at the midpoints, but somewhere else.Wait, perhaps I should consider that the square is placed such that each corner touches a side of the hexagon. Let me model this.Let me consider a square centered at the origin, rotated by θ degrees, with side length 'a'. The square's sides are at a distance of (a/2) from the center along the x and y axes, but rotated by θ.Wait, the distance from the center to each side of the square is (a/2) / cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the square's side and the line from the center to the midpoint of that side.Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the distance from the center to a side of the square.Wait, the distance from the center to a side of the square is (a/2) * cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the square's side and the line from the center to the midpoint of that side.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should use the formula for the distance from the center to a side, which is (a/2) / cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the square's side and the line from the center to the midpoint of that side.Wait, perhaps I should think of the square as being rotated by θ, so that its sides are at an angle θ relative to the x-axis.In that case, the distance from the center to each side of the square is (a/2) / cos(θ). This distance must be less than or equal to the distance from the center to the sides of the hexagon, which is the apothem, which is √3.So, (a/2) / cos(θ) ≤ √3.Similarly, the distance from the center to the vertices of the square must be less than or equal to the distance from the center to the vertices of the hexagon, which is 2.The distance from the center to a vertex of the square is (a/2) * √2, which must be ≤ 2.So, (a/2) * √2 ≤ 2 ⇒ a ≤ 2√2 ≈ 2.828.So, the maximum possible side length of the square is 2√2, but it must also satisfy the condition (a/2) / cos(θ) ≤ √3.If I want the square to be as large as possible, I need to maximize 'a' while satisfying both conditions.Let me solve for θ when a = 2√2.Then, ( (2√2)/2 ) / cos(θ) = √3 ⇒ √2 / cos(θ) = √3 ⇒ cos(θ) = √2 / √3 ⇒ θ = arccos(√(2/3)) ≈ 35.264 degrees.Wait, but the hexagon's sides are at 60 degrees, so maybe θ is 30 degrees, which is half of 60 degrees.Wait, if θ = 30 degrees, then cos(θ) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.Then, (a/2) / (√3/2) = a / √3 ≤ √3 ⇒ a ≤ 3.But earlier, we found that a ≤ 2√2 ≈ 2.828, which is less than 3, so the maximum a is 2√2 when θ = arccos(√(2/3)).Wait, but maybe the squares are placed at θ = 30 degrees, which would make their sides align with the hexagon's diagonals.Wait, if θ = 30 degrees, then cos(θ) = √3/2, so (a/2) / (√3/2) = a / √3 ≤ √3 ⇒ a ≤ 3.But since a is limited by the distance to the vertices, which is 2√2, which is less than 3, so a = 2√2 is acceptable.Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Maybe I should instead consider that each square is placed such that its sides are tangent to the hexagon's sides.Wait, perhaps the squares are placed such that their sides are tangent to the hexagon's sides at the midpoints. So, each side of the square touches the midpoint of a hexagon's side.Wait, but the midpoints are at (2,0), (1, √3), etc., as I listed before. If I place a square such that its sides are tangent to these midpoints, then the square would have its sides touching these points.Wait, but how would that look? Let me try to model it.If the square is tangent to the midpoints of the hexagon's sides, then each side of the square would pass through two midpoints. For example, one side of the square would pass through (2,0) and (1, √3), but that's a diagonal, not a straight side.Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each side of the square is tangent to a midpoint of a hexagon's side.Wait, maybe the square is placed such that each side is tangent to the midpoint of a hexagon's side. So, for example, the top side of the square is tangent to the midpoint of the top side of the hexagon, which is at (0, √3).Wait, but the square's side would have to be horizontal, so the top side would be y = k, and it would be tangent to (0, √3). So, k = √3.Similarly, the bottom side would be y = -√3, the left side x = -√3, and the right side x = √3.Wait, but that would make the square have side length 2√3, which is larger than the hexagon's width of 4, because 2√3 ≈ 3.464, which is less than 4. So, that square would fit inside the hexagon.Wait, but the distance from the center to each side of the square would be √3, which is the apothem of the hexagon. So, that makes sense.Wait, so the square would have side length 2√3, and area (2√3)^2 = 12. But the hexagon's area is 6√3 ≈ 10.392, which is less than 12, so that can't be right. So, the square can't have a side length of 2√3 because it would extend beyond the hexagon.Wait, so maybe the square is smaller. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps the square is placed such that its sides are tangent to the midpoints of the hexagon's sides, but the square is smaller. Let me calculate the maximum square that can fit inside the hexagon with sides tangent to the midpoints.Wait, the distance from the center to each side of the square would be equal to the apothem of the hexagon, which is √3. So, for a square, the distance from the center to a side is (a/2) / cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the square's side and the line from the center to the midpoint of that side.Wait, if the square is axis-aligned, then θ = 0, so cos(θ) = 1, so (a/2) / 1 = a/2 = √3 ⇒ a = 2√3. But as before, that square would have a side length of 2√3, which is too large because the hexagon's width is 4, and 2√3 ≈ 3.464, which is less than 4, so maybe it's possible.Wait, but the square's corners would be at (±√3, ±√3), which are points outside the hexagon because the hexagon's vertices are at (2,0), etc. So, the square's corners would extend beyond the hexagon's boundaries, which is not allowed.Wait, so maybe the square can't be axis-aligned if it's tangent to the midpoints. Maybe it needs to be rotated.Wait, let me consider a square rotated by 45 degrees. Then, the distance from the center to each side is (a/2) / cos(45°) = (a/2) / (√2/2) = a / √2.This distance must be equal to the apothem of the hexagon, which is √3. So, a / √2 = √3 ⇒ a = √3 * √2 = √6 ≈ 2.449.So, the side length of the square would be √6, and its area would be (√6)^2 = 6.Wait, but the hexagon's area is 6√3 ≈ 10.392, so a square of area 6 could fit inside.Wait, but does the square with side length √6, rotated by 45 degrees, fit inside the hexagon without any of its corners extending beyond the hexagon's sides?Let me check the distance from the center to the square's corners. For a square rotated by 45 degrees, the distance from the center to each corner is (a/2) * √2 = (√6 / 2) * √2 = (√12)/2 = (2√3)/2 = √3 ≈ 1.732.But the hexagon's vertices are at a distance of 2 from the center, so √3 < 2, so the square's corners would lie inside the hexagon.Wait, that seems possible. So, the square with side length √6, rotated by 45 degrees, would fit inside the hexagon, with its sides tangent to the midpoints of the hexagon's sides, and its corners lying inside the hexagon.Wait, but in this problem, there are two squares inside the hexagon. So, maybe each square is rotated by 45 degrees but in opposite directions, or by some other angle.Wait, but if each square is rotated by 45 degrees, their overlapping area would be a regular octagon, but I'm not sure.Wait, maybe the two squares are each rotated by 30 degrees relative to the hexagon's sides, so their overlapping area is a smaller shape.Wait, perhaps I should consider that each square is placed such that their sides are aligned with the hexagon's axes, but rotated by 30 degrees relative to each other.Wait, let me try to calculate the overlapping area between two squares of side length √6, each rotated by 30 degrees relative to each other, centered at the origin.Wait, the area of overlap between two squares can be found using the formula involving the side lengths and the angle between them. But I don't remember the exact formula.Wait, alternatively, maybe I can find the coordinates of the overlapping region and calculate its area.Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular hexagon, and calculate its area based on the side length.Wait, but I don't know the side length of the overlapping hexagon.Wait, another idea: perhaps the overlapping area is a regular dodecagon, but that might be too complex.Wait, maybe I should look for symmetry. Since the hexagon is regular and the squares are placed symmetrically, the overlapping area should also be symmetric.Wait, perhaps the overlapping area is a regular hexagon, and I can find its area by subtracting the non-overlapping parts from the total area.Wait, but I don't know the area of the squares yet. If each square has an area of 6, as calculated earlier, then the total area covered by both squares would be 6 + 6 - overlapping area.But the hexagon's area is 6√3 ≈ 10.392, so 6 + 6 - overlapping area ≤ 10.392 ⇒ overlapping area ≥ 11.608, which is impossible because the squares can't cover more area than the hexagon. So, that approach is wrong.Wait, maybe the squares are smaller. Let me think again.Wait, perhaps each square has a side length of 2, same as the hexagon's side length. Then, their area would be 4 each, and the overlapping area would be something less.Wait, but how would a square of side length 2 fit inside the hexagon? Let me try to model it.If I place a square with side length 2 inside the hexagon, its corners would be at (1,1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), assuming it's axis-aligned. But the hexagon's sides are at 60 degrees, so these points might lie inside the hexagon.Wait, let me check if (1,1) lies inside the hexagon. The hexagon's vertices are at (2,0), (1, √3), (-1, √3), (-2,0), (-1, -√3), (1, -√3). So, the point (1,1) is inside the hexagon because it's below the line connecting (1, √3) to (2,0).Wait, yes, because √3 ≈ 1.732, so (1,1) is below that line.Similarly, the point (1,1) is inside the hexagon, so the square with vertices at (1,1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1) would fit inside the hexagon.Wait, but the distance between (1,1) and (-1,1) is 2 units, which is the side length of the square, so that works.Wait, but then if I have two such squares, one rotated by 0 degrees and the other rotated by 60 degrees, their overlapping area would be the region where both squares cover the same space.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should calculate the coordinates of the overlapping region.Wait, let me consider Square 1 with vertices at (1,1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), and Square 2, which is Square 1 rotated by 60 degrees around the origin.Let me find the coordinates of Square 2 after rotation by 60 degrees.Using the rotation matrix:x' = x cos θ - y sin θy' = x sin θ + y cos θWhere θ = 60 degrees, so cos θ = 0.5, sin θ = √3/2.So, for vertex (1,1):x' = 1*0.5 - 1*(√3/2) = 0.5 - √3/2 ≈ 0.5 - 0.866 ≈ -0.366y' = 1*(√3/2) + 1*0.5 ≈ 0.866 + 0.5 ≈ 1.366Similarly, for (-1,1):x' = (-1)*0.5 - 1*(√3/2) = -0.5 - √3/2 ≈ -0.5 - 0.866 ≈ -1.366y' = (-1)*(√3/2) + 1*0.5 ≈ -0.866 + 0.5 ≈ -0.366For (-1,-1):x' = (-1)*0.5 - (-1)*(√3/2) = -0.5 + √3/2 ≈ -0.5 + 0.866 ≈ 0.366y' = (-1)*(√3/2) + (-1)*0.5 ≈ -0.866 - 0.5 ≈ -1.366For (1,-1):x' = 1*0.5 - (-1)*(√3/2) = 0.5 + √3/2 ≈ 0.5 + 0.866 ≈ 1.366y' = 1*(√3/2) + (-1)*0.5 ≈ 0.866 - 0.5 ≈ 0.366So, Square 2 after rotation has vertices approximately at (-0.366, 1.366), (-1.366, -0.366), (0.366, -1.366), (1.366, 0.366).Now, to find the overlapping area between Square 1 and Square 2, I need to find the region where both squares cover the same space.This seems complex, but maybe I can find the intersection points of the two squares and then calculate the area of the overlapping polygon.Let me try to find the intersection points between Square 1 and Square 2.Square 1 has edges:1. From (1,1) to (-1,1): y = 1, x from -1 to 1.2. From (-1,1) to (-1,-1): x = -1, y from -1 to 1.3. From (-1,-1) to (1,-1): y = -1, x from -1 to 1.4. From (1,-1) to (1,1): x = 1, y from -1 to 1.Square 2 has edges:1. From (-0.366, 1.366) to (-1.366, -0.366): Let's find the equation of this line.The slope m = (-0.366 - 1.366) / (-1.366 - (-0.366)) = (-1.732) / (-1) = 1.732 ≈ √3.So, the equation is y - 1.366 = √3 (x + 0.366).Similarly, other edges can be found, but this is getting too involved.Wait, maybe I can use symmetry. Since both squares are symmetric and rotated by 60 degrees relative to each other, their overlapping area should also be symmetric.Wait, perhaps the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with side length 'a', and I can find 'a' by considering the distance from the center to the intersection points.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular dodecagon, but that might be too complex.Wait, another idea: the overlapping area between two squares rotated by 60 degrees relative to each other can be calculated using the formula for the area of intersection of two squares. But I don't remember the exact formula.Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the overlapping area is a regular hexagon, and calculate its area based on the distance from the center to its vertices.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with side length 2 - √3, but that's one of the answer choices.Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 4 - 2√3, which is approximately 4 - 3.464 = 0.536. That seems small, but maybe.Wait, another approach: maybe the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with side length 2 - √3, so its area would be (3√3/2) * (2 - √3)^2.Wait, let me calculate that:(2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3.Then, area = (3√3/2) * (7 - 4√3) = (21√3 - 12*3)/2 = (21√3 - 36)/2 ≈ (36.373 - 36)/2 ≈ 0.373/2 ≈ 0.186, which is too small.Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.Wait, perhaps the overlapping area is a square with side length 2 - √3, so area would be (2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3 ≈ 7 - 6.928 ≈ 0.072, which is even smaller.Wait, that can't be right because the overlapping area should be larger.Wait, maybe the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with side length 1, so area would be (3√3/2) * 1^2 ≈ 2.598, which is option C: 4 - √3 ≈ 4 - 1.732 ≈ 2.268, which is close but not exact.Wait, perhaps I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular octagon, but I don't know.Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider that each square has a side length of 2, and they are placed such that their centers coincide with the hexagon's center, and they are rotated by 30 degrees relative to each other.Wait, then the overlapping area can be calculated as the area of the square minus the area of the four triangles that are outside the overlapping region.Wait, but I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: the area of overlap between two squares of side length 'a', rotated by θ degrees relative to each other, can be calculated using the formula:Area = 2a² cos θ - a² sin θBut I'm not sure if that's correct.Wait, let me check for θ = 0 degrees, the area should be a², but according to the formula, it would be 2a² - 0 = 2a², which is incorrect. So, that formula must be wrong.Wait, maybe the correct formula is more complex. I think it involves integrating or using polygon intersection algorithms.Wait, perhaps it's better to use coordinate geometry to find the intersection points and then calculate the area.Wait, let me consider Square 1 with vertices at (1,1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), and Square 2, which is Square 1 rotated by 60 degrees.I can find the equations of the sides of both squares and find their intersection points.Let me start with Square 1's top side: y = 1, from x = -1 to x = 1.Square 2's top side is from (-0.366, 1.366) to (-1.366, -0.366). The equation of this line is y = √3 x + c.Wait, earlier, I calculated the slope as √3, so let's use that.Using point (-0.366, 1.366):1.366 = √3*(-0.366) + c ⇒ c = 1.366 + 0.366*√3 ≈ 1.366 + 0.634 ≈ 2.Wait, so the equation is y = √3 x + 2.Wait, let me check with another point, say (-1.366, -0.366):y = √3*(-1.366) + 2 ≈ -2.366 + 2 ≈ -0.366, which matches. So, the equation is correct.Now, find the intersection of y = 1 and y = √3 x + 2.Set 1 = √3 x + 2 ⇒ √3 x = -1 ⇒ x = -1/√3 ≈ -0.577.So, the intersection point is at (-1/√3, 1).Similarly, find the intersection of Square 1's top side with Square 2's other edges.Wait, Square 2 has four edges, so I need to check each one.Wait, but this is time-consuming. Maybe I can find all intersection points and then determine the overlapping polygon.Alternatively, maybe I can use symmetry and realize that the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with side length 2 - √3, so the area would be 6 * (1/2) * (2 - √3)^2 * sin(60°).Wait, let me calculate that:(2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3.Then, area = 6 * (1/2) * (7 - 4√3) * (√3/2) = 3 * (7 - 4√3) * (√3/2) = (21√3 - 12*3)/2 = (21√3 - 36)/2 ≈ (36.373 - 36)/2 ≈ 0.373/2 ≈ 0.186, which is too small.Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the side length is different.Wait, perhaps the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with side length 1, so area would be (3√3/2)*1^2 ≈ 2.598, which is close to option C: 4 - √3 ≈ 2.268.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with side length 2 - √3, but that gives a very small area.Wait, maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is a square with side length 2 - √3, so area is (2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3 ≈ 7 - 6.928 ≈ 0.072, which is too small.Wait, perhaps the overlapping area is a rectangle with sides of length 2 - √3 and 2, so area would be 2*(2 - √3) = 4 - 2√3, which is option D.That seems plausible because 4 - 2√3 ≈ 4 - 3.464 ≈ 0.536, which is a reasonable area for the overlapping region.Wait, but how did I get here? Maybe I should think differently.Wait, perhaps the overlapping area is a rectangle formed by the intersection of the two squares. Each square has a side length of 2, and they are rotated by 60 degrees relative to each other, so their overlapping area is a rectangle with sides of length 2 - √3 and 2 - √3, making it a square with area (2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3, but that's not one of the options.Wait, but option D is 4 - 2√3, which is exactly half of that. So maybe the overlapping area is a rectangle with sides of length 2 - √3 and 2, giving an area of 2*(2 - √3) = 4 - 2√3.That would make sense because each square has a side length of 2, and the overlapping region is a rectangle that's narrower in one dimension.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with area 4 - 2√3.Wait, let me calculate the area of a regular hexagon with side length 'a':Area = (3√3/2) * a².If I set this equal to 4 - 2√3, then:(3√3/2) * a² = 4 - 2√3 ⇒ a² = (4 - 2√3) * 2 / (3√3) = (8 - 4√3) / (3√3).This seems complicated, so maybe it's not a regular hexagon.Wait, perhaps the overlapping area is a rectangle with sides of length 2 - √3 and 2, giving an area of 4 - 2√3, which is option D.Alternatively, maybe the overlapping area is a square with side length 2 - √3, giving an area of (2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3, which is not one of the options.Wait, but option D is 4 - 2√3, which is exactly half of that. So maybe the overlapping area is a rectangle with sides of length 2 - √3 and 2, giving an area of 4 - 2√3.Alternatively, maybe the overlapping area is a regular octagon, but I don't know.Wait, perhaps I should consider that the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with area 4 - 2√3.Wait, let me check the calculation again. If the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with side length 'a', then:Area = (3√3/2) * a² = 4 - 2√3.Solving for 'a':a² = (4 - 2√3) * 2 / (3√3) = (8 - 4√3) / (3√3).Multiply numerator and denominator by √3:a² = (8√3 - 12) / 9.This gives a² = (8√3 - 12)/9 ≈ (13.856 - 12)/9 ≈ 1.856/9 ≈ 0.206.So, a ≈ √0.206 ≈ 0.454, which seems too small.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.If each square has a side length of 2, and they are placed such that their sides are aligned with the hexagon's sides but rotated by 60 degrees relative to each other, then the overlapping area would be a regular hexagon with side length 2 - √3.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the overlapping area is a square with side length 2 - √3, giving an area of (2 - √3)^2 = 4 - 4√3 + 3 = 7 - 4√3, which is not an option.Wait, but option D is 4 - 2√3, which is exactly half of that. So maybe the overlapping area is a rectangle with sides of length 2 - √3 and 2, giving an area of 4 - 2√3.Alternatively, perhaps the overlapping area is a regular hexagon with area 4 - 2√3, but I can't confirm that without more precise calculations.Wait, given the options, and considering that 4 - 2√3 is a possible area, I think the answer is D) 4 - 2√3."},{"question":"The least common multiple of two numbers is 3780, and the greatest common divisor is 18.

Solving for ( m ) results in ( m = frac{k^2}{8} ).For ( m ) to be an integer, ( k^2 ) must be divisible by 8. This implies that ( k ) itself must be divisible by 2, as the square of an even number is divisible by 4, and to be divisible by 8, ( k ) needs to be a multiple of 2.Let ( k = 2n ), where ( n ) is an integer. Substituting back into the equation for ( m ) gives ( m = frac{(2n)^2}{8} = frac{4n^2}{8} = frac{n^2}{2} ).To ensure ( m ) is an integer, ( n^2 ) must be even, which means ( n ) must also be even. Let ( n = 2p ), where ( p ) is an integer. Substituting again, ( m = frac{(2p)^2}{2} = frac{4p^2}{2} = 2p^2 ).Thus, ( m ) must be twice a perfect square.

Since the number of women is three times the number of children and there are 30 children, I can calculate the number of women by multiplying 30 by 3.Next, I'll find out how many men there are. The number of men is twice the number of women. After determining the number of women, I'll multiply that number by 2 to get the number of men.Finally, to find the total number of people in the group, I'll add the number of children, women, and men together."},{"question":"The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence left{a_nright} is denoted as S_n. Given that S_{k-2}=-4, S_k=0, and S_{k+2}=8 (k > 2,kinmathbb{N}^*), find the value of k.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. The sum of the first n terms is denoted as S_n. They give me three pieces of information: S_{k-2} = -4, S_k = 0, and S_{k+2} = 8, where k is a natural number greater than 2. I need to find the value of k.Hmm, arithmetic sequences. Let me recall. An arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive terms. The sum of the first n terms, S_n, can be calculated using the formula:S_n = (n/2) * [2a + (n - 1)d]where a is the first term and d is the common difference.Alternatively, another formula for the sum is:S_n = (n/2) * (a + l)where l is the last term, which is a + (n - 1)d.So, since we have S_{k-2}, S_k, and S_{k+2}, maybe I can set up equations using these formulas.Let me denote:S_{k-2} = -4S_k = 0S_{k+2} = 8So, I can write three equations:1. S_{k-2} = (k - 2)/2 * [2a + (k - 3)d] = -42. S_k = k/2 * [2a + (k - 1)d] = 03. S_{k+2} = (k + 2)/2 * [2a + (k + 1)d] = 8Hmm, so I have three equations with two variables, a and d. Maybe I can solve for a and d in terms of k, and then find k.Alternatively, maybe I can find the difference between S_k and S_{k-2}, and between S_{k+2} and S_k, since those differences might correspond to the sum of certain terms.Let me think. The difference S_k - S_{k-2} should be equal to the sum of the (k-1)th and kth terms. Similarly, S_{k+2} - S_k should be equal to the sum of the (k+1)th and (k+2)th terms.So, let's compute these differences.First, S_k - S_{k-2} = 0 - (-4) = 4.Similarly, S_{k+2} - S_k = 8 - 0 = 8.So, the sum of the (k-1)th and kth terms is 4, and the sum of the (k+1)th and (k+2)th terms is 8.In an arithmetic sequence, each term is the previous term plus d. So, the (k-1)th term is a + (k - 2)d, and the kth term is a + (k - 1)d. So, their sum is:[a + (k - 2)d] + [a + (k - 1)d] = 2a + (2k - 3)d = 4.Similarly, the (k+1)th term is a + k d, and the (k+2)th term is a + (k + 1)d. Their sum is:[a + k d] + [a + (k + 1)d] = 2a + (2k + 1)d = 8.So now I have two equations:1. 2a + (2k - 3)d = 42. 2a + (2k + 1)d = 8If I subtract the first equation from the second, I can eliminate a:[2a + (2k + 1)d] - [2a + (2k - 3)d] = 8 - 4Simplify:(2k + 1 - 2k + 3)d = 4(4)d = 4So, d = 1.Okay, so the common difference d is 1.Now, plug d = 1 back into one of the equations to find a.Let's take the first equation:2a + (2k - 3)(1) = 4So,2a + 2k - 3 = 42a = 4 - 2k + 32a = 7 - 2ka = (7 - 2k)/2So, a is (7 - 2k)/2.Now, let's go back to the original sum formula. Let's use S_k = 0.S_k = k/2 [2a + (k - 1)d] = 0We know d = 1, so:k/2 [2a + (k - 1)(1)] = 0Multiply both sides by 2:k [2a + k - 1] = 0Since k > 2, k cannot be 0, so:2a + k - 1 = 0We already have a in terms of k:a = (7 - 2k)/2So, plug that into the equation:2*(7 - 2k)/2 + k - 1 = 0Simplify:(7 - 2k) + k - 1 = 07 - 2k + k - 1 = 0(7 - 1) + (-2k + k) = 06 - k = 0So, 6 - k = 0 => k = 6Wait, so k is 6. Let me check if this makes sense.Let me verify with the given sums.First, k = 6.So, S_{k-2} = S_4 = -4S_k = S_6 = 0S_{k+2} = S_8 = 8Let me compute a and d.We found d = 1, and a = (7 - 2k)/2 = (7 - 12)/2 = (-5)/2 = -2.5So, a = -2.5, d = 1.Let me compute S_4, S_6, and S_8.First, S_n = n/2 [2a + (n - 1)d]Compute S_4:4/2 [2*(-2.5) + 3*1] = 2 [ -5 + 3 ] = 2*(-2) = -4. Correct.Compute S_6:6/2 [2*(-2.5) + 5*1] = 3 [ -5 + 5 ] = 3*(0) = 0. Correct.Compute S_8:8/2 [2*(-2.5) + 7*1] = 4 [ -5 + 7 ] = 4*(2) = 8. Correct.So, all the given sums check out. Therefore, k = 6 is the correct answer.I think that makes sense. So, the value of k is 6.**Final Answer**The value of ( k ) is boxed{6}."},{"question":"If a and b are opposite numbers, and the reciprocal of c is 4, then the value of 3a+3b-4c is ____.","answer":"First, since ( a ) and ( b ) are opposite numbers, it means that ( b = -a ).

The problem has two parts. First, I need to find the value of b given that the slope of the tangent line at the point (0, f(0)) is 3. Second, if the function has a local maximum at x=1, I need to find the value of a. Hmm, let me tackle these one by one.Starting with part (1): Finding the value of b. I remember that the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a particular point is given by the derivative of the function evaluated at that point. So, I need to find f'(x) and then plug in x=0. The result should be 3.Let me compute the derivative f'(x). The function is f(x) = (a²/3)x³ - 2a x² + b x. So, term by term:- The derivative of (a²/3)x³ is (a²/3)*3x², which simplifies to a² x².- The derivative of -2a x² is -2a*2x, which is -4a x.- The derivative of b x is just b.So, putting it all together, f'(x) = a² x² - 4a x + b.Now, evaluate this derivative at x=0. Plugging in x=0:f'(0) = a²*(0)² - 4a*(0) + b = 0 - 0 + b = b.But we are told that the slope at (0, f(0)) is 3. Therefore, f'(0) = 3, which means b = 3. Okay, that seems straightforward. So, part (1) is done, and b is 3.Moving on to part (2): If f(x) has a local maximum at x=1, find the value of a. Hmm, okay. So, for a function to have a local maximum at a point, two conditions must be satisfied:1. The first derivative at that point must be zero (critical point).2. The second derivative at that point must be negative (concave down).So, let me first find the first derivative, which I already have from part (1): f'(x) = a² x² - 4a x + b. But since we found b=3 in part (1), I can substitute that in. So, f'(x) = a² x² - 4a x + 3.Now, since x=1 is a critical point, f'(1) must be zero. Let's compute f'(1):f'(1) = a²*(1)² - 4a*(1) + 3 = a² - 4a + 3.Set this equal to zero:a² - 4a + 3 = 0.This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me solve for a. The quadratic is a² - 4a + 3 = 0. Using the quadratic formula:a = [4 ± sqrt(16 - 12)] / 2 = [4 ± sqrt(4)] / 2 = [4 ± 2]/2.So, the solutions are:a = (4 + 2)/2 = 6/2 = 3,anda = (4 - 2)/2 = 2/2 = 1.So, a can be either 3 or 1. But wait, we need to check whether these values of a actually result in a local maximum at x=1. Because sometimes critical points can be minima or points of inflection, so we need to ensure that the second derivative is negative at x=1.Let me compute the second derivative f''(x). Starting from f'(x) = a² x² - 4a x + 3, the derivative of that is:f''(x) = 2a² x - 4a.Now, evaluate f''(1):f''(1) = 2a²*(1) - 4a = 2a² - 4a.For x=1 to be a local maximum, f''(1) must be less than zero:2a² - 4a < 0.Let's factor this:2a(a - 2) < 0.So, the inequality 2a(a - 2) < 0. Let me analyze the sign of this expression.First, note that 2 is positive, so the sign depends on a(a - 2).The roots of the expression a(a - 2) are at a=0 and a=2.So, the intervals to test are:1. a < 0: Let's pick a = -1. Then, (-1)(-1 - 2) = (-1)(-3) = 3 > 0.2. 0 < a < 2: Let's pick a = 1. Then, (1)(1 - 2) = (1)(-1) = -1 < 0.3. a > 2: Let's pick a = 3. Then, (3)(3 - 2) = (3)(1) = 3 > 0.So, the expression 2a(a - 2) is negative only when 0 < a < 2.But from earlier, the solutions for a were a=1 and a=3.So, check if these a values lie in the interval where 2a(a - 2) < 0.- For a=1: 1 is between 0 and 2, so 2*1*(1 - 2) = 2*(-1) = -2 < 0. So, a=1 is valid.- For a=3: 3 is greater than 2, so 2*3*(3 - 2) = 6*1 = 6 > 0. So, a=3 would result in a positive second derivative, meaning it's a local minimum, not a maximum.Therefore, only a=1 satisfies both conditions: f'(1)=0 and f''(1) < 0, which means x=1 is a local maximum.So, the value of a is 1.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, f'(x) was correctly computed as a² x² - 4a x + 3. Plugging x=1 gives a² - 4a + 3 = 0, which factors as (a - 1)(a - 3) = 0, so a=1 or a=3. Correct.Then, the second derivative f''(x) is 2a² x - 4a. At x=1, it's 2a² - 4a. Factoring gives 2a(a - 2). So, the inequality 2a(a - 2) < 0 holds when 0 < a < 2. Since a=1 is in this interval, it's a maximum. a=3 is outside, so it's a minimum. So, yes, a=1 is the correct answer.Therefore, part (2) answer is a=1.**Final Answer**(1) boxed{3}(2) boxed{1}"},{"question":"Given the function f(x) = e^{x-1} - ln x.  (1) Find the local minimum value of f(x).  (2) If the function g(x) = f(x) - a(x-1), where a in mathbb{R}, find the maximum value of the local minimum of g(x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = e^{x-1} - ln x. I need to find its local minimum value. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling that to find local minima or maxima, I should take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero. That should give me the critical points, and then I can determine if those points are minima or maxima.First, let me write down the function again: f(x) = e^{x-1} - ln x. I need to find f'(x). The derivative of e^{x-1} is straightforward because the derivative of e^u is e^u times the derivative of u. So, the derivative of e^{x-1} is e^{x-1} * (1) = e^{x-1}. Now, the derivative of -ln x is -1/x. So putting it together, f'(x) = e^{x-1} - 1/x. To find the critical points, I set f'(x) = 0:e^{x-1} - 1/x = 0So, e^{x-1} = 1/xHmm, this equation looks a bit tricky. It's a transcendental equation, meaning it can't be solved algebraically easily. Maybe I can solve it numerically or see if there's a nice solution.Let me test x=1. Plugging in x=1: e^{1-1} = e^0 = 1, and 1/x = 1. So, 1 = 1. That works! So x=1 is a critical point.Is that the only critical point? Let me check the behavior of f'(x) as x approaches 0 and as x approaches infinity.As x approaches 0 from the right, ln x approaches negative infinity, so -ln x approaches positive infinity. But e^{x-1} approaches e^{-1} which is about 0.3679. So, f'(x) = e^{x-1} - 1/x. As x approaches 0+, 1/x approaches infinity, so f'(x) approaches negative infinity.As x approaches infinity, e^{x-1} grows exponentially, while 1/x approaches 0. So, f'(x) approaches infinity.At x=1, f'(x)=0. Let me see the behavior around x=1. Let's pick x=0.5: f'(0.5) = e^{-0.5} - 2 ≈ 0.6065 - 2 ≈ -1.3935, which is negative. At x=2: f'(2) = e^{1} - 0.5 ≈ 2.718 - 0.5 ≈ 2.218, which is positive. So, the derivative goes from negative to positive as x increases through 1, which means that x=1 is a local minimum.So, the local minimum occurs at x=1. To find the local minimum value, I plug x=1 into f(x):f(1) = e^{1-1} - ln 1 = e^0 - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1.So, the local minimum value is 1.Wait, but just to make sure, is there another critical point? Let me think. The equation e^{x-1} = 1/x. Let me define h(x) = e^{x-1} - 1/x. We know h(1)=0. Let's see h(0.5) = e^{-0.5} - 2 ≈ 0.6065 - 2 ≈ -1.3935, which is negative. h(2) ≈ e^{1} - 0.5 ≈ 2.718 - 0.5 ≈ 2.218, positive. So, it goes from negative to positive, so only one critical point at x=1. So, that's the only local minimum.Alright, so part (1) is done. The local minimum value is 1.Now, moving on to part (2): If the function g(x) = f(x) - a(x - 1), where a is a real number, find the maximum value of the local minimum of g(x).Hmm, okay. So, g(x) is f(x) minus a linear term a(x - 1). So, g(x) = e^{x-1} - ln x - a(x - 1).We need to find the maximum value of the local minimum of g(x). So, for each a, g(x) will have some local minima, and we need to find the maximum among all these local minima as a varies over real numbers.Alternatively, perhaps the local minimum of g(x) is a function of a, and we need to find its maximum.Wait, let me think.First, let's analyze g(x). Let's write it down:g(x) = e^{x-1} - ln x - a(x - 1)To find the local minima of g(x), we need to take its derivative, set it equal to zero, find critical points, determine which are minima, and then find the value of the function at those minima. Then, we need to find the maximum of these minima over all a.Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the local minima in terms of a and then find the maximum.Let me compute the derivative of g(x):g'(x) = f'(x) - a*(1) = e^{x-1} - 1/x - aSo, to find critical points, set g'(x) = 0:e^{x-1} - 1/x - a = 0So, e^{x-1} - 1/x = aSo, for each a, the critical points x satisfy e^{x-1} - 1/x = a.Wait, but this is similar to the equation we had in part (1), except now a is a parameter.In part (1), when a=0, the critical point was x=1.But now, for different a, we have different critical points.But we need to find the local minima of g(x). So, for each a, we can have critical points, but whether they are minima or maxima depends on the second derivative.Wait, but perhaps we can think of this as a function h(x) = e^{x-1} - 1/x, and a is a parameter. So, the equation h(x) = a.So, depending on the value of a, the equation h(x) = a can have different numbers of solutions.In part (1), when a=0, we had x=1 as the solution.But for other a, we can have different x.Wait, but h(x) = e^{x-1} - 1/x. Let me analyze h(x):As x approaches 0+, e^{x-1} approaches e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679, and -1/x approaches -infty, so h(x) approaches -infty.As x approaches infinity, e^{x-1} approaches infinity, and -1/x approaches 0, so h(x) approaches infinity.At x=1, h(1) = e^{0} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.What about the derivative of h(x)? h'(x) = e^{x-1} + 1/x^2.Since e^{x-1} is always positive and 1/x^2 is always positive for x>0, h'(x) is always positive. So, h(x) is strictly increasing on (0, ∞). Therefore, h(x) is a bijection from (0, ∞) to (-infty, ∞). So, for every real number a, there is exactly one x such that h(x) = a.Therefore, for each a, there is exactly one critical point x_a where g'(x_a) = 0.Now, since h(x) is strictly increasing, the function h(x) is one-to-one, so for each a, only one critical point x_a.Now, to determine whether this critical point is a minimum or maximum, let's look at the second derivative of g(x).Compute g''(x):g''(x) = derivative of g'(x) = derivative of (e^{x-1} - 1/x - a) = e^{x-1} + 1/x^2.Since e^{x-1} is always positive and 1/x^2 is always positive for x>0, g''(x) is always positive. Therefore, every critical point is a local minimum.So, for each a, there is exactly one local minimum at x_a, where x_a satisfies e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a = a.Therefore, the local minimum value of g(x) is g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - a(x_a -1).But we can express a in terms of x_a: a = e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a.So, substituting back into g(x_a):g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - (e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a)(x_a -1)Let me compute this step by step.First, expand the term:g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - (e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a)(x_a -1)Let me distribute the (x_a -1):= e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) + (1/x_a)(x_a -1)Simplify term by term:First term: e^{x_a -1}Second term: - ln x_aThird term: - e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1)Fourth term: (1/x_a)(x_a -1) = (x_a -1)/x_a = 1 - 1/x_aSo, putting it all together:g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) + 1 - 1/x_aLet me factor out e^{x_a -1} from the first and third terms:= e^{x_a -1}(1 - (x_a -1)) - ln x_a + 1 - 1/x_aSimplify inside the parentheses:1 - (x_a -1) = 1 - x_a +1 = 2 - x_aSo,= e^{x_a -1}(2 - x_a) - ln x_a + 1 - 1/x_aHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to express g(x_a).Wait, let me think again.We have g(x_a) = f(x_a) - a(x_a -1). Since f(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a, and a = e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a, so:g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - (e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a)(x_a -1)Let me compute (e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a)(x_a -1):= e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) - (1/x_a)(x_a -1)= e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) - (x_a -1)/x_aSo, g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - [e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) - (x_a -1)/x_a]= e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) + (x_a -1)/x_aNow, let's factor e^{x_a -1}:= e^{x_a -1}(1 - (x_a -1)) - ln x_a + (x_a -1)/x_a= e^{x_a -1}(2 - x_a) - ln x_a + (x_a -1)/x_aWait, that's the same as before. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe we can write (x_a -1)/x_a as 1 - 1/x_a.So,g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1}(2 - x_a) - ln x_a + 1 - 1/x_aHmm, not sure if this helps.Alternatively, maybe we can express g(x_a) in terms of a.Wait, since a = e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a, we can write e^{x_a -1} = a + 1/x_a.So, substituting back into g(x_a):g(x_a) = (a + 1/x_a) - ln x_a - a(x_a -1)= a + 1/x_a - ln x_a - a x_a + a= 2a + 1/x_a - ln x_a - a x_aHmm, that's another expression.So, g(x_a) = 2a + 1/x_a - ln x_a - a x_aBut I don't know if that's helpful.Alternatively, maybe we can express g(x_a) in terms of x_a only.Wait, since a = e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a, we can write:g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - (e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a)(x_a -1)Which we already did.Alternatively, perhaps we can write g(x_a) in terms of x_a.Wait, maybe let's compute g(x_a):g(x_a) = f(x_a) - a(x_a -1)But f(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_aAnd a = e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_aSo,g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - (e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a)(x_a -1)Let me compute this again step by step.First, expand the product:(e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a)(x_a -1) = e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) - (1/x_a)(x_a -1)= e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) - (x_a -1)/x_aSo, g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - [e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) - (x_a -1)/x_a]= e^{x_a -1} - ln x_a - e^{x_a -1}(x_a -1) + (x_a -1)/x_aNow, factor e^{x_a -1}:= e^{x_a -1}(1 - (x_a -1)) - ln x_a + (x_a -1)/x_a= e^{x_a -1}(2 - x_a) - ln x_a + (x_a -1)/x_aHmm, same as before.Alternatively, let's compute (x_a -1)/x_a = 1 - 1/x_a, so:g(x_a) = e^{x_a -1}(2 - x_a) - ln x_a + 1 - 1/x_aHmm, maybe we can write this as:g(x_a) = [e^{x_a -1}(2 - x_a) - ln x_a - 1/x_a] + 1But I don't see an immediate simplification.Alternatively, maybe we can consider that since x_a is a function of a, and we need to maximize g(x_a) over a. So, perhaps we can consider g(x_a) as a function of x_a, and then find its maximum.Wait, but x_a is related to a via a = e^{x_a -1} - 1/x_a.So, perhaps we can write g(x_a) in terms of x_a, and then take the derivative with respect to x_a, set it to zero, and find the maximum.Let me try that.Let me denote y = x_a for simplicity.So, a = e^{y -1} - 1/yAnd g(y) = e^{y -1} - ln y - a(y -1)But a = e^{y -1} - 1/y, so:g(y) = e^{y -1} - ln y - (e^{y -1} - 1/y)(y -1)Which is the same as before.So, let me write g(y) as:g(y) = e^{y -1} - ln y - e^{y -1}(y -1) + (y -1)/ySimplify:= e^{y -1}(1 - (y -1)) - ln y + (y -1)/y= e^{y -1}(2 - y) - ln y + (y -1)/ySo, g(y) = e^{y -1}(2 - y) - ln y + 1 - 1/yNow, to find the maximum of g(y) over y > 0.Wait, but y is related to a via a = e^{y -1} - 1/y, and for each a, there is a unique y. So, as a varies over all real numbers, y varies over (0, ∞). So, we can consider g(y) as a function of y, and find its maximum.So, let's treat g(y) as a function of y, and find its critical points.Compute the derivative of g(y) with respect to y:g'(y) = derivative of [e^{y -1}(2 - y)] + derivative of [- ln y] + derivative of [1 - 1/y]First term: derivative of e^{y -1}(2 - y)Use product rule: e^{y -1}*(2 - y) + e^{y -1}*(-1) = e^{y -1}(2 - y -1) = e^{y -1}(1 - y)Second term: derivative of -ln y is -1/yThird term: derivative of 1 is 0, derivative of -1/y is 1/y^2So, putting it all together:g'(y) = e^{y -1}(1 - y) - 1/y + 1/y^2So, to find critical points, set g'(y) = 0:e^{y -1}(1 - y) - 1/y + 1/y^2 = 0Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can factor or rearrange terms.Let me write it as:e^{y -1}(1 - y) = 1/y - 1/y^2Factor the right-hand side:1/y - 1/y^2 = (y - 1)/y^2So, we have:e^{y -1}(1 - y) = (y - 1)/y^2Note that (1 - y) = -(y - 1), so:e^{y -1}(- (y -1)) = (y -1)/y^2Multiply both sides by -1:e^{y -1}(y -1) = - (y -1)/y^2Factor out (y -1):(y -1)(e^{y -1} + 1/y^2) = 0So, either y -1 = 0 or e^{y -1} + 1/y^2 = 0But e^{y -1} is always positive, and 1/y^2 is always positive for y > 0, so e^{y -1} + 1/y^2 is always positive. Therefore, the only solution is y -1 = 0, so y =1.Therefore, the only critical point is at y=1.Now, we need to check if this is a maximum or a minimum.Compute the second derivative of g(y) at y=1.But before that, let's compute g(y) at y=1:g(1) = e^{0}(2 -1) - ln 1 + 1 - 1/1 = 1*1 - 0 +1 -1 = 1 -0 +1 -1 =1So, g(1)=1.Now, let's check the behavior around y=1.Take y slightly less than 1, say y=0.9:Compute g'(0.9):First, compute e^{0.9 -1}=e^{-0.1}≈0.90481 - y = 1 -0.9=0.1So, first term: e^{y -1}(1 - y)=0.9048*0.1≈0.09048Second term: -1/y≈-1/0.9≈-1.1111Third term:1/y^2≈1/(0.81)≈1.2345So, g'(0.9)=0.09048 -1.1111 +1.2345≈0.09048 +0.1234≈0.2139>0So, g'(0.9) is positive.Now, take y slightly more than 1, say y=1.1:Compute e^{1.1 -1}=e^{0.1}≈1.10521 - y=1 -1.1=-0.1First term: e^{y -1}(1 - y)=1.1052*(-0.1)≈-0.11052Second term: -1/y≈-1/1.1≈-0.9091Third term:1/y^2≈1/(1.21)≈0.8264So, g'(1.1)= -0.11052 -0.9091 +0.8264≈(-1.0196)+0.8264≈-0.1932<0So, g'(1.1) is negative.Therefore, the derivative changes from positive to negative as y increases through 1, which means that y=1 is a local maximum.Since this is the only critical point, and as y approaches 0+, let's see what happens to g(y):As y approaches 0+, e^{y -1} approaches e^{-1}≈0.3679, (2 - y) approaches 2, so e^{y -1}(2 - y) approaches ~0.7358. -ln y approaches infinity, and 1 -1/y approaches negative infinity. So, g(y) approaches negative infinity.As y approaches infinity, e^{y -1}(2 - y) approaches negative infinity because (2 - y) becomes negative and e^{y -1} grows exponentially. -ln y approaches negative infinity, and 1 -1/y approaches 1. So, overall, g(y) approaches negative infinity.Therefore, the function g(y) has a single critical point at y=1, which is a local maximum, and as y approaches 0+ or infinity, g(y) approaches negative infinity. Therefore, the maximum value of g(y) is at y=1, which is g(1)=1.Therefore, the maximum value of the local minimum of g(x) is 1.Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.Because in part (1), the local minimum of f(x) was 1. Now, in part (2), we are considering g(x) = f(x) - a(x -1), and we found that the maximum of the local minima of g(x) is also 1. That seems interesting.But is that correct? Let me think.When a=0, g(x)=f(x), so the local minimum is 1.When a≠0, we are shifting f(x) by a linear term. Depending on a, the local minimum of g(x) could be higher or lower.But according to our analysis, the maximum of these local minima is 1, which occurs when a=0.Wait, but let me think about when a is varied. If a is positive, we subtract a positive multiple of (x -1), which would lower the function for x>1 and raise it for x<1. Similarly, if a is negative, we add a positive multiple of (x -1).But in our analysis, we found that the maximum of the local minima occurs at a=0, giving the local minimum value of 1.Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.Wait, the problem says: \\"find the maximum value of the local minimum of g(x)\\". So, for each a, g(x) has a local minimum, and we need to find the maximum among all these local minima.From our analysis, the local minimum of g(x) is a function of a, and we found that this function has a maximum at a=0, with value 1.Therefore, the maximum value of the local minimum of g(x) is 1.So, the answer is 1.But let me just verify with a=0, the local minimum is 1, which is the same as in part (1). If I take a positive a, say a=1, then g(x)=f(x) - (x -1). Let's compute its local minimum.Wait, but according to our previous analysis, for a=1, we have x_a satisfying e^{x_a -1} -1/x_a=1.Let me try to solve e^{x -1} -1/x =1.Let me test x=1: e^{0} -1=1 -1=0≠1.x=2: e^{1} -1/2≈2.718 -0.5≈2.218>1.x=1.5: e^{0.5}≈1.6487 -1/1.5≈1.6487 -0.6667≈0.982≈close to 1.x=1.6: e^{0.6}≈1.8221 -1/1.6≈1.8221 -0.625≈1.197>1.x=1.4: e^{0.4}≈1.4918 -1/1.4≈1.4918 -0.7143≈0.7775<1.So, the solution is between 1.4 and 1.6.But regardless, the local minimum value is g(x_a)=1, as per our previous conclusion.Wait, but if I compute g(x_a) when a=1, it's not necessarily 1.Wait, no, in our analysis, we found that the maximum of g(x_a) over a is 1, which occurs when a=0.So, for a=1, the local minimum of g(x) is less than 1.Similarly, for a negative, the local minimum might be higher or lower?Wait, let me test a negative a. Let's say a=-1.Then, g(x)=f(x) + (x -1).So, g(x)=e^{x -1} - ln x +x -1.Compute its derivative: g'(x)=e^{x -1} -1/x +1.Set to zero: e^{x -1} -1/x +1=0.Hmm, let me see if x=1 is a solution: e^{0} -1 +1=1 -1 +1=1≠0.x=0.5: e^{-0.5}≈0.6065 -2 +1≈-0.3935≠0.x=2: e^{1}≈2.718 -0.5 +1≈3.218≠0.Wait, maybe x= something else.Wait, but according to our previous analysis, for each a, there is exactly one x_a, so for a=-1, there is some x_a.But regardless, the maximum of g(x_a) over a is 1, achieved when a=0.Therefore, the answer is 1.So, summarizing:(1) The local minimum value of f(x) is 1.(2) The maximum value of the local minimum of g(x) is also 1.**Final Answer**(1) The local minimum value of ( f(x) ) is (boxed{1}).(2) The maximum value of the local minimum of ( g(x) ) is (boxed{1})."},{"question":"Let a oslash b = (sqrt{2a+b})^3.

Simplifying inside the square root, I have ((sqrt{8 + x})^3 = 27).Next, I take the cube root of both sides to eliminate the exponent on the left side.

Hmm, that's a bit intimidating with all those exponents, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me write it down again to get a better look:(3²⁰¹¹ + 3²⁰¹¹) / (3²⁰¹⁰ + 3²⁰¹²)Alright, so both the numerator and the denominator have terms with exponents of 3. Maybe I can factor out common terms or rewrite them to make it simpler.Starting with the numerator: 3²⁰¹¹ + 3²⁰¹¹. That's just two of the same terms added together, right? So that should be 2 times 3²⁰¹¹. Let me write that:Numerator = 2 * 3²⁰¹¹Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, the denominator is 3²⁰¹⁰ + 3²⁰¹². Hmm, those exponents are close to each other. Maybe I can factor out the smaller exponent to simplify. Let's see, 3²⁰¹⁰ is smaller than 3²⁰¹², so I can factor out 3²⁰¹⁰ from both terms.Denominator = 3²⁰¹⁰ + 3²⁰¹² = 3²⁰¹⁰ (1 + 3²)Wait, because 3²⁰¹² is 3²⁰¹⁰ * 3², right? So factoring out 3²⁰¹⁰ gives me 1 + 3² inside the parentheses. Let me calculate 3²: that's 9. So, 1 + 9 is 10. Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:Denominator = 3²⁰¹⁰ * 10Alright, so now my expression is:Numerator / Denominator = (2 * 3²⁰¹¹) / (3²⁰¹⁰ * 10)Hmm, I can simplify the exponents here. 3²⁰¹¹ divided by 3²⁰¹⁰ is 3^(2011 - 2010) which is 3^1, so that's 3. So, let me rewrite that:= (2 * 3) / 10Because 3²⁰¹¹ / 3²⁰¹⁰ = 3, so it's 2 * 3 in the numerator and 10 in the denominator.So, 2 * 3 is 6, so now I have:= 6 / 10Hmm, 6 divided by 10 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:= 3 / 5Wait, that's one of the answer choices. Let me check the options again:(A) 3/5(B) 1(C) 9/10(D) 10/3(E) 2/3So, 3/5 is option A. Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.Starting again:Numerator: 3²⁰¹¹ + 3²⁰¹¹ = 2 * 3²⁰¹¹Denominator: 3²⁰¹⁰ + 3²⁰¹² = 3²⁰¹⁰ (1 + 3²) = 3²⁰¹⁰ * 10So, expression becomes (2 * 3²⁰¹¹) / (3²⁰¹⁰ * 10)Simplify 3²⁰¹¹ / 3²⁰¹⁰ = 3^(2011 - 2010) = 3^1 = 3So, numerator is 2 * 3 = 6, denominator is 10, so 6/10 = 3/5.Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be A) 3/5.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in factoring. Let me think about the denominator again: 3²⁰¹⁰ + 3²⁰¹². Is that equal to 3²⁰¹⁰ (1 + 3²)?Yes, because 3²⁰¹² is 3²⁰¹⁰ * 3², so factoring out 3²⁰¹⁰ gives 1 + 3², which is 10. So that part is correct.And the numerator: 3²⁰¹¹ + 3²⁰¹¹ is definitely 2 * 3²⁰¹¹. So that's correct too.So, putting it all together, 2 * 3²⁰¹¹ divided by 3²⁰¹⁰ * 10 is 2 * 3 / 10, which is 6/10, simplifying to 3/5.Therefore, I think A is the correct answer.But just to be thorough, let me try plugging in smaller exponents to see if the pattern holds. Maybe if I replace 2011 with, say, 2, and 2010 with 1, and 2012 with 3, just to test the expression.So, let's say the expression is (3² + 3²) / (3¹ + 3³). Calculating that:Numerator: 9 + 9 = 18Denominator: 3 + 27 = 30So, 18 / 30 = 3/5. Hmm, same result. So, that seems to confirm that the pattern holds.

I need to find the value of a + b + ab. Hmm, angle bisector... third quadrant... Let me think about what that means.First, I remember that an angle bisector is a line that divides an angle into two equal parts. In the context of coordinate geometry, especially in the third quadrant, the angle bisector would likely be the line that splits the angle formed by the positive x-axis and positive y-axis, but since we're in the third quadrant, it's probably the line that splits the angle between the negative x-axis and negative y-axis.Wait, actually, in the third quadrant, both x and y are negative. So, the angle bisector there would be the line that is equally inclined to both the negative x-axis and negative y-axis. That should be the line y = x, but since we're in the third quadrant, it would be y = x, but in the negative direction. Wait, no, y = x is in the first and third quadrants, but in the third quadrant, it's still y = x. Hmm, but is that the angle bisector?Wait, no. The angle bisector between the negative x-axis and negative y-axis in the third quadrant is actually the line y = x, right? Because it's 45 degrees from both axes. So, if that's the case, then the angle bisector in the third quadrant is the line y = x.But wait, hold on. If that's the case, then points A and B lying on this bisector should satisfy the equation y = x. So, for point A(-4, a), plugging into y = x would mean a = -4. Similarly, for point B(-2, b), plugging into y = x would mean b = -2. Then, a + b + ab would be (-4) + (-2) + (-4)(-2) = -6 + 8 = 2. So, is the answer 2?But wait, I'm not sure if the angle bisector is y = x or if it's another line. Let me think again. The angle bisector in the third quadrant is the line that makes equal angles with both the negative x-axis and negative y-axis. So, in the third quadrant, the angle between the negative x-axis and negative y-axis is 90 degrees, so the bisector would be at 45 degrees from each. So, yes, that would be the line y = x.Wait, but in the third quadrant, if we have the negative x-axis and negative y-axis, the angle between them is 90 degrees, so the bisector would be the line that is 45 degrees from each, which is indeed y = x. So, points on this bisector would satisfy y = x. Therefore, for point A(-4, a), a must be -4, and for point B(-2, b), b must be -2.So, plugging in, a = -4, b = -2. Then, a + b + ab = (-4) + (-2) + (-4)(-2) = (-6) + 8 = 2. So, the value is 2.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is the angle bisector in the third quadrant really y = x? Because sometimes, depending on the angle, the bisector can be different. For example, if we're talking about the angle between the positive x-axis and positive y-axis, the bisector is y = x, but in the third quadrant, it's still y = x because it's just the same line extended into the third quadrant.Alternatively, maybe the angle bisector is not y = x but another line. Let me consider another approach. The angle bisector can be found using the formula for the angle bisector between two lines. Since we're dealing with the negative x-axis and negative y-axis, which can be represented by the lines y = 0 (x-axis) and x = 0 (y-axis), but in the third quadrant, both x and y are negative.Wait, actually, the negative x-axis is y = 0 for x < 0, and the negative y-axis is x = 0 for y < 0. The angle between them is 90 degrees, and the bisector would be the line that is equally distant from both axes. So, in the third quadrant, that line is y = x, because for any point on y = x, the distance to the x-axis and y-axis is equal.But let me think about the distance from a point to a line. The distance from a point (x, y) to the x-axis is |y|, and the distance to the y-axis is |x|. So, if a point is equidistant from both axes, then |x| = |y|. In the third quadrant, both x and y are negative, so |x| = |y| implies x = y. Therefore, the angle bisector is indeed the line y = x.Therefore, points A and B lying on this bisector must satisfy y = x. So, for point A(-4, a), a = -4, and for point B(-2, b), b = -2. So, a + b + ab = (-4) + (-2) + (-4)(-2) = (-6) + 8 = 2.Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me check if there's another interpretation. Maybe the angle bisector is not y = x but another line. For example, sometimes, in coordinate geometry, the angle bisector can refer to the bisector of the angle between two lines, not necessarily the axes.Wait, but the problem says \\"the angle bisector in the third quadrant.\\" So, it's likely referring to the bisector of the angle formed by the negative x-axis and negative y-axis, which is indeed y = x.Alternatively, if the angle bisector was between two other lines, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume it's the bisector of the angle between the negative x-axis and negative y-axis, which is y = x.Therefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct: a + b + ab = 2.Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. a = -4, b = -2. So, a + b = -4 + (-2) = -6. ab = (-4)*(-2) = 8. So, a + b + ab = -6 + 8 = 2. Yep, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe the angle bisector is not y = x but another line. Let me think about the formula for the angle bisector between two lines. If we have two lines L1 and L2, the angle bisector can be found using the formula involving their slopes. But in this case, the two lines are the negative x-axis and negative y-axis, which are perpendicular. So, their angle bisector is y = x.Wait, another thought: in the third quadrant, the angle between the negative x-axis and negative y-axis is 90 degrees, so the bisector would be at 45 degrees from each, which is y = x. So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, I think the answer is 2.**Final Answer**boxed{2}"},{"question":"Given a set of data: 2, 3, a, 5, 6, their average is 4. Find the variance of this data set.","answer":"First, I need to find the value of ( a ) by using the average formula. The average of the data set is given as 4, and there are 5 numbers in total. So, the sum of all numbers should be ( 5 times 4 = 20 ).Next, I'll set up the equation with the given numbers: ( 2 + 3 + a + 5 + 6 = 20 ). Simplifying this, I get ( 16 + a = 20 ), which means ( a = 4 ).Now that I have all the numbers—2, 3, 4, 5, 6—I can calculate the variance. The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. First, I'll find the squared differences for each number:- ( (2 - 4)^2 = 4 )- ( (3 - 4)^2 = 1 )- ( (4 - 4)^2 = 0 )- ( (5 - 4)^2 = 1 )- ( (6 - 4)^2 = 4 )Adding these squared differences gives ( 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 10 ).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I should figure out which numbers in the set M end with the digit 8. Since we're dealing with numbers from 1 to 2018, the numbers ending with 8 will be 8, 18, 28, 38, and so on, up to the largest number less than or equal to 2018 that ends with 8.Let me write down the sequence of these numbers. Starting from 8, each subsequent number is 10 more than the previous one. So, it's an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 is 8, and the common difference d is 10.Now, I need to find the last term of this sequence. Since the set goes up to 2018, the last term should be the largest number less than or equal to 2018 that ends with 8. Let me calculate that.2018 divided by 10 is 201.8, so the integer part is 201. That means the last term is 201 * 10 + 8, which is 2018. Wait, 2018 does end with 8, so that's correct. So, the last term an is 2018.Now, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find how many terms there are. The formula is:an = a1 + (n - 1)dPlugging in the values:2018 = 8 + (n - 1)*10Let me solve for n:2018 - 8 = (n - 1)*102010 = (n - 1)*10Divide both sides by 10:201 = n - 1So, n = 202Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculation again.Wait, 2018 divided by 10 is 201.8, so the number of terms should be 202 because we start counting from 8 as the first term. Hmm, maybe that's correct.Alternatively, I can think of it as the numbers ending with 8 occur every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 2010, there are 201 numbers ending with 8 (since 2010 / 10 = 201). Then, 2018 is the next one, making it 202 terms. Yeah, that makes sense.So, there are 202 terms in this arithmetic sequence.Now, to find the sum of these terms, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:S = n/2 * (a1 + an)Plugging in the values:S = 202/2 * (8 + 2018)S = 101 * (2026)Hmm, let me compute 101 multiplied by 2026.First, 100 * 2026 = 202,600Then, 1 * 2026 = 2,026Adding them together: 202,600 + 2,026 = 204,626So, the sum should be 204,626.Wait, let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with arithmetic sequences, it's easy to make a mistake in the number of terms.Another way to compute the sum is to recognize that each term can be written as 10k + 8, where k starts from 0 up to some maximum value.So, the first term is when k=0: 10*0 + 8 = 8The second term is k=1: 10*1 + 8 = 18...The last term is when 10k + 8 = 2018, so 10k = 2010, so k = 201So, k ranges from 0 to 201, which is 202 terms, as I found earlier.So, the sum S can be written as the sum from k=0 to k=201 of (10k + 8)Which can be split into two sums:S = 10 * sum(k=0 to 201 of k) + 8 * sum(k=0 to 201 of 1)Compute each part:First, sum(k=0 to 201 of k) is the sum of the first 202 natural numbers starting from 0. The formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n - 1)/2, but since we start from 0, it's the same as sum(k=1 to 201 of k) which is 201*202/2.Wait, actually, sum(k=0 to m of k) is m(m + 1)/2. So, for m=201, it's 201*202/2.Similarly, sum(k=0 to 201 of 1) is just 202, since there are 202 terms.So, let's compute each part:First part: 10 * (201 * 202 / 2) = 10 * (201 * 101) = 10 * 20301 = 203,010Second part: 8 * 202 = 1,616Adding them together: 203,010 + 1,616 = 204,626Same result as before. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can compute the average of the first and last term and multiply by the number of terms.Average term = (8 + 2018)/2 = 2026/2 = 1013Number of terms = 202Sum = 1013 * 202Let me compute 1013 * 200 = 202,600Then, 1013 * 2 = 2,026Adding them together: 202,600 + 2,026 = 204,626Same answer again. So, that's reassuring.Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 1013 * 202 step by step.202 can be broken down into 200 + 2.1013 * 200 = 1013 * 2 * 100 = 2026 * 100 = 202,6001013 * 2 = 2,026Adding them: 202,600 + 2,026 = 204,626Yes, that's correct.So, all methods lead to the same sum of 204,626.Wait, but let me just check once more because sometimes when dealing with inclusive counts, it's easy to make an off-by-one error.So, the numbers ending with 8 are 8, 18, 28, ..., 2018.How many terms is that?From 8 to 2018, stepping by 10.Number of terms can be calculated as ((last - first) / step) + 1So, ((2018 - 8)/10) + 1 = (2010/10) + 1 = 201 + 1 = 202 terms. So, that's correct.Therefore, the sum is 202/2 * (8 + 2018) = 101 * 2026 = 204,626.I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 204,626.**Final Answer**The sum of the elements whose last digit is 8 is boxed{204626}."},{"question":"Alexa and Emily open up a lemonade stand in the front yard.

If a_4+a_5+a_6=21, then S_9= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about an arithmetic sequence. It says that the sum of the fourth, fifth, and sixth terms is 21, and I need to find the sum of the first nine terms, which is denoted as ( S_9 ). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference, usually denoted by ( d ). So, if I denote the first term of the sequence as ( a_1 ), then the second term is ( a_1 + d ), the third term is ( a_1 + 2d ), and so on. In general, the ( n )-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be written as:[a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d]Got that down. So, each term is just the first term plus some multiple of the common difference.Now, the problem gives me that ( a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 21 ). Let me write out each of these terms using the formula for the ( n )-th term.Starting with ( a_4 ):[a_4 = a_1 + (4 - 1)d = a_1 + 3d]Then ( a_5 ):[a_5 = a_1 + (5 - 1)d = a_1 + 4d]And ( a_6 ):[a_6 = a_1 + (6 - 1)d = a_1 + 5d]So, adding these together:[a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = (a_1 + 3d) + (a_1 + 4d) + (a_1 + 5d)]Let me simplify that:[= a_1 + 3d + a_1 + 4d + a_1 + 5d]Combine like terms:- The ( a_1 ) terms: ( a_1 + a_1 + a_1 = 3a_1 )- The ( d ) terms: ( 3d + 4d + 5d = 12d )So, altogether:[3a_1 + 12d = 21]Hmm, okay, so that's an equation involving ( a_1 ) and ( d ). But I need to find ( S_9 ), the sum of the first nine terms. Let me recall the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence. I think it's:[S_n = frac{n}{2} times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)]Alternatively, I remember another version where it's the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms:[S_n = frac{n}{2} times (a_1 + a_n)]Either formula should work. Maybe the second one is easier here since I might not know ( a_1 ) or ( d ) yet.But wait, I have an equation from the given information: ( 3a_1 + 12d = 21 ). Maybe I can simplify that equation to find a relationship between ( a_1 ) and ( d ). Let's try that.Divide both sides of the equation by 3:[a_1 + 4d = 7]So, ( a_1 + 4d = 7 ). Hmm, interesting. Let me note that down.Now, I need to find ( S_9 ). Using the sum formula:[S_9 = frac{9}{2} times (2a_1 + 8d)]Wait, let me verify that. The formula is ( S_n = frac{n}{2} times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d) ). So, for ( n = 9 ):[S_9 = frac{9}{2} times (2a_1 + 8d)]Alternatively, using the other formula:[S_9 = frac{9}{2} times (a_1 + a_9)]Since ( a_9 = a_1 + 8d ), both formulas are consistent.Looking back at the equation I had: ( a_1 + 4d = 7 ). Maybe I can express ( 2a_1 + 8d ) in terms of this equation.Let me see:[2a_1 + 8d = 2(a_1 + 4d)]Oh, that's clever! Since ( a_1 + 4d = 7 ), then:[2(a_1 + 4d) = 2 times 7 = 14]So, ( 2a_1 + 8d = 14 ).Therefore, plugging this back into the sum formula:[S_9 = frac{9}{2} times 14]Let me compute that. First, ( frac{9}{2} times 14 ). Hmm, 14 divided by 2 is 7, so 9 times 7 is 63. So, ( S_9 = 63 ).Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I wrote down the expressions for ( a_4 ), ( a_5 ), and ( a_6 ) correctly.2. I added them together and simplified to get ( 3a_1 + 12d = 21 ), which seems right.3. Divided by 3 to get ( a_1 + 4d = 7 ). That's correct.4. Then, for ( S_9 ), I used the sum formula and recognized that ( 2a_1 + 8d ) is just twice ( (a_1 + 4d) ), which is 14. Then multiplied by ( frac{9}{2} ) to get 63. That seems solid.Alternatively, if I use the other sum formula:[S_9 = frac{9}{2} times (a_1 + a_9)]But ( a_9 = a_1 + 8d ), so:[S_9 = frac{9}{2} times (a_1 + a_1 + 8d) = frac{9}{2} times (2a_1 + 8d)]Which is the same as before, so it's consistent.Alternatively, if I didn't see that trick, I could try to solve for ( a_1 ) and ( d ) individually, but that might involve more steps. Let me see if that's necessary.From ( a_1 + 4d = 7 ), I can express ( a_1 = 7 - 4d ). Then, plug that into the sum formula:[S_9 = frac{9}{2} times (2a_1 + 8d) = frac{9}{2} times [2(7 - 4d) + 8d]]Compute inside the brackets:[2(7 - 4d) = 14 - 8d]So, adding ( 8d ):[14 - 8d + 8d = 14]So, again, we get ( S_9 = frac{9}{2} times 14 = 63 ). So, same result.Therefore, whether I manipulate the equation or solve for ( a_1 ) in terms of ( d ), I still end up with ( S_9 = 63 ).Just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using the properties of arithmetic sequences.In an arithmetic sequence, the sum of terms equidistant from the ends is constant. But in this case, we're given three consecutive terms, not symmetric around the middle. Hmm, maybe that's not directly helpful here.Alternatively, I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, the average of a set of terms is equal to the average of the first and last term in that set. So, for ( a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 21 ), the average of these three terms is ( 21 / 3 = 7 ). Which is equal to the average of ( a_4 ) and ( a_6 ):[frac{a_4 + a_6}{2} = frac{(a_1 + 3d) + (a_1 + 5d)}{2} = frac{2a_1 + 8d}{2} = a_1 + 4d]Which is exactly the equation we had before: ( a_1 + 4d = 7 ). So, that's another way to see why ( a_1 + 4d = 7 ).Therefore, since ( a_1 + 4d = 7 ), which is the fifth term ( a_5 ), because ( a_5 = a_1 + 4d ). So, ( a_5 = 7 ).Wait, that's interesting. So, the fifth term is 7. Since the sequence is arithmetic, the average of the first nine terms is equal to the middle term, which is the fifth term. Because in an arithmetic sequence, the average of the first ( n ) terms is equal to the average of the first and last term, which is also equal to the middle term if ( n ) is odd.Since 9 is odd, the average of the first nine terms is the fifth term, which is 7. Therefore, the sum ( S_9 ) is ( 9 times 7 = 63 ). That's a much quicker way to see it!So, that's another approach. Recognizing that in an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the first ( n ) terms is equal to the number of terms multiplied by the average term, which for an odd number of terms is the middle term. Since the fifth term is 7, the sum is ( 9 times 7 = 63 ).That's a nice shortcut. I should remember that for future problems.So, putting it all together, whether I approach it by expanding the terms, solving for ( a_1 ) and ( d ), or using the property of the average term in an arithmetic sequence, I consistently get ( S_9 = 63 ).I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and multiple methods lead to the same answer. So, I feel confident that ( S_9 = 63 ).**Final Answer**The sum of the first nine terms is boxed{63}."},{"question":"There are 2 boys and 3 girls standing in a row. If boy A does not stand at either end, and among the 3 girls, exactly 2 girls stand next to each other, then the number of different arrangements is ________.","answer":"Okay, so I've got this problem here: There are 2 boys and 3 girls standing in a row. The conditions are that boy A doesn't stand at either end, and among the 3 girls, exactly 2 girls stand next to each other. I need to find the number of different arrangements. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.First, let me visualize the problem. There are 5 people in total: 2 boys (let's call them A and B) and 3 girls (let's name them G1, G2, G3). They need to stand in a row, so there are 5 positions in total.The first condition is that boy A cannot stand at either end. So, boy A must be in one of the middle three positions: positions 2, 3, or 4. That leaves positions 1 and 5 for the other boy, B, or for the girls.The second condition is that among the 3 girls, exactly 2 stand next to each other. That means we can't have all three girls together, nor can we have all three girls separated by boys. So, exactly two girls are adjacent, and the third girl is separated by at least one boy.Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can first figure out the possible arrangements of the girls with the given condition and then place the boys accordingly, making sure that boy A isn't at either end.So, starting with the girls: we have 3 girls, and exactly two must be next to each other. So, the girls can be arranged in two blocks: one block of two girls and one single girl. These two blocks need to be separated by at least one boy.Wait, but the boys are only two, so if we have two blocks of girls, we can place the boys in between them or at the ends. Hmm, but since we have two boys, maybe we can place one boy between the two girl blocks and the other boy somewhere else.But before that, let me calculate the number of ways to arrange the girls. Since exactly two girls are together, we can consider the two girls as a single entity or \\"block.\\" So, we have two blocks: one block of two girls and one single girl.The number of ways to choose which two girls form the block is C(3,2) = 3. Then, within that block, the two girls can be arranged in 2! ways. So, for the girls, the number of arrangements is 3 * 2! = 6.Now, considering these two blocks (the pair and the single girl), we need to place them in the row along with the two boys. But we have to remember that these two girl blocks need to be separated by at least one boy to satisfy the condition that exactly two girls are together.So, the total number of entities to arrange is: two girl blocks and two boys, making it four entities. But wait, actually, the two girl blocks and the two boys can be arranged in the row. However, we need to ensure that the two girl blocks are not adjacent, meaning there must be at least one boy between them.Wait, but actually, since we have two girl blocks and two boys, the arrangement will have the two girl blocks separated by at least one boy. So, the number of ways to arrange these four entities (two girl blocks and two boys) is the number of permutations where the two girl blocks are not adjacent.But wait, actually, since we have two girl blocks and two boys, the number of ways to arrange them so that the two girl blocks are not adjacent is equal to the total number of arrangements minus the number of arrangements where the two girl blocks are adjacent.But hold on, actually, the two girl blocks can be placed in the row with the boys in between. Since we have two girl blocks and two boys, the number of ways to arrange them is the number of ways to arrange four items where two are identical (the girl blocks) and the other two are identical (the boys). Wait, no, actually, the girl blocks are distinct because they consist of different girls, and the boys are distinct as well (A and B). So, actually, all four entities are distinct.Wait, no, the girl blocks are actually two different entities: one is a pair of girls, and the other is a single girl. So, they are distinct. Similarly, the boys are two distinct individuals. So, we have four distinct entities: the pair of girls, the single girl, boy A, and boy B.So, the number of ways to arrange these four entities is 4! = 24. But we need to subtract the cases where the two girl blocks are adjacent. Wait, no, actually, since we want exactly two girls together, meaning the two girl blocks cannot be adjacent. So, we need to arrange the four entities such that the two girl blocks are not next to each other.Wait, but actually, the two girl blocks are the pair and the single girl. So, if they are adjacent, that would mean the single girl is next to the pair, forming a trio of girls, which we don't want. So, we need to ensure that the single girl is not adjacent to the pair.Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is the total number of arrangements of the four entities minus the number of arrangements where the two girl blocks are adjacent.Total arrangements: 4! = 24.Number of arrangements where the two girl blocks are adjacent: treat the pair and the single girl as a single block, so we have three entities: the trio of girls, boy A, and boy B. The number of ways to arrange these three entities is 3! = 6. But within the trio, the single girl can be on either side of the pair, so we have 2 possibilities. So, total arrangements where the two girl blocks are adjacent: 6 * 2 = 12.Wait, no, actually, if we treat the pair and the single girl as a single block, the number of arrangements is 3! = 6, but within the trio, the single girl can be either to the left or the right of the pair, so that's 2 possibilities. So, total arrangements where the two girl blocks are adjacent: 6 * 2 = 12.Therefore, the number of arrangements where the two girl blocks are not adjacent is 24 - 12 = 12.But wait, hold on, this is the number of ways to arrange the four entities (pair, single girl, A, B) such that the pair and single girl are not adjacent. But each of these arrangements corresponds to a specific placement in the row.However, we also need to consider the internal arrangements of the pair of girls. Earlier, we calculated that the number of ways to choose the pair and arrange them is 3 * 2! = 6.So, the total number of arrangements for the girls and boys is 12 (arrangements of the four entities) multiplied by 6 (arrangements of the girls within their blocks). So, 12 * 6 = 72.But wait, hold on, that seems high. Let me double-check.Wait, no, actually, the 12 arrangements already account for the different positions of the pair and single girl, as well as the boys. But the girls within the pair can be arranged in 2! ways, and the single girl is just one, so that's 2! per pair.But we also have to consider the different ways to choose the pair. There are C(3,2) = 3 ways to choose which two girls form the pair, and each pair can be arranged in 2! ways. So, that's 3 * 2 = 6.Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 12 (arrangements of the four entities) multiplied by 6 (arrangements of the girls). So, 12 * 6 = 72.But hold on, that's 72, but I think I might be overcounting because when we arrange the four entities, the pair and single girl are distinct, but the girls themselves are distinct, so maybe that's already accounted for.Wait, no, actually, the 12 arrangements of the four entities already consider the pair and single girl as distinct, so when we multiply by the 6 arrangements of the girls, we're considering all possible pairings and their internal arrangements.But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently.Alternatively, maybe I should first consider the positions of the girls and then place the boys.Since exactly two girls are adjacent, we can think of them as a block. So, the total number of \\"units\\" to arrange is: the pair of girls, the single girl, and the two boys. That's four units.But we need to ensure that the single girl is not adjacent to the pair, so the two girl blocks are separated by at least one boy.So, the number of ways to arrange these four units is equal to the number of permutations of four items where the two girl units are not adjacent.Wait, but actually, the four units are: pair, single, A, B. So, the number of ways to arrange them without the pair and single being adjacent is equal to total arrangements minus arrangements where pair and single are adjacent.Total arrangements: 4! = 24.Arrangements where pair and single are adjacent: treat pair and single as a single unit, so we have three units: trio, A, B. The number of arrangements is 3! = 6. But within the trio, the single can be on either side of the pair, so 2 possibilities. So, total arrangements where pair and single are adjacent: 6 * 2 = 12.Therefore, arrangements where pair and single are not adjacent: 24 - 12 = 12.Now, for each of these 12 arrangements, we need to consider the internal arrangements of the girls.First, the pair of girls: there are C(3,2) = 3 choices for which two girls form the pair, and each pair can be arranged in 2! ways. So, 3 * 2 = 6.Additionally, the single girl is just one, so no further arrangements needed there.So, total number of arrangements is 12 (arrangements of units) * 6 (arrangements of girls) = 72.But wait, hold on, that seems high because the total number of possible arrangements without any restrictions is 5! = 120. So, 72 is a significant portion, but let's see if that's correct.But hold on, actually, we also have the condition that boy A cannot be at either end. So, we need to consider that in our calculations.So, perhaps I should approach this differently: first, figure out the number of valid arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent, and then subtract the cases where boy A is at either end.Alternatively, maybe I should first place the boys, considering the restriction on boy A, and then place the girls accordingly.Let me try that approach.First, let's consider the positions of the boys. There are 5 positions in total.Boy A cannot be at positions 1 or 5, so he must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.So, let's consider each case for boy A's position and then place boy B and the girls accordingly.Case 1: Boy A is in position 2.Then, boy B can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But wait, we have to ensure that exactly two girls are adjacent.Wait, maybe this approach is getting complicated. Let me think.Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as arranging the girls first with the given condition and then placing the boys in the remaining spots, making sure that boy A isn't at the ends.So, let's go back to the girls. We have three girls, and exactly two are adjacent. So, as before, we can consider the girls as a pair and a single.The number of ways to arrange the girls is 3 * 2! = 6 (choosing the pair and arranging them). Then, we have to place the single girl such that she is not adjacent to the pair.So, considering the row of 5 positions, if we place the pair in some positions, the single girl must be placed in a position not adjacent to the pair.But perhaps it's better to model this as arranging the girls and boys together, considering the restrictions.Wait, maybe another approach: first, figure out all the possible ways to arrange the girls with exactly two adjacent, and then place the boys in the remaining spots, considering the restriction on boy A.So, let's first figure out how many ways the girls can be arranged with exactly two adjacent.We can model the girls as a pair and a single. The pair can be placed in positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5. For each placement of the pair, the single girl must be placed in a position not adjacent to the pair.So, let's enumerate the possible placements:1. Pair in positions 1-2:   - Single girl cannot be in position 3.   - So, single girl can be in positions 4 or 5.   - So, 2 choices.2. Pair in positions 2-3:   - Single girl cannot be in positions 1 or 4.   - So, single girl can be in positions 5.   - Wait, position 5 is available, but position 1 is also available? Wait, no, if the pair is in 2-3, then the single girl can't be in 1 or 4? Wait, no, actually, if the pair is in 2-3, then the single girl can't be adjacent to the pair, which would be positions 1 and 4.   So, single girl can be in positions 5.   Wait, but position 1 is also non-adjacent to the pair in 2-3. So, single girl can be in position 1 or 5.   Wait, no, position 1 is adjacent to position 2, which is part of the pair. So, if the pair is in 2-3, the single girl can't be in 1 or 4.   So, single girl can be in position 5.   Wait, but position 1 is adjacent to position 2, which is part of the pair, so single girl can't be in 1. Similarly, position 4 is adjacent to position 3, which is part of the pair, so single girl can't be in 4. So, only position 5 is available.   So, 1 choice.3. Pair in positions 3-4:   - Similar to pair in 2-3, but mirrored.   - Single girl can't be in positions 2 or 5.   - So, single girl can be in position 1.   So, 1 choice.4. Pair in positions 4-5:   - Single girl can't be in position 3.   - So, single girl can be in positions 1 or 2.   - So, 2 choices.So, total number of ways to place the pair and single girl:- Pair in 1-2: 2- Pair in 2-3: 1- Pair in 3-4: 1- Pair in 4-5: 2Total: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6.But wait, for each of these placements, we also have to consider the internal arrangements of the girls.For each placement, the pair can be any two of the three girls, and the single girl is the remaining one. So, for each placement, the number of arrangements is C(3,2) * 2! = 3 * 2 = 6.But wait, actually, for each specific placement (like pair in 1-2, single in 4), the number of girl arrangements is 6. But since we have 6 different placements (as above), each with 6 arrangements, that would be 6 * 6 = 36.Wait, but that seems high because the total number of ways to arrange the girls is 5P3 = 60, but with restrictions.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.Actually, for each placement of the pair and single girl (as per the 6 cases above), the girls can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. But since we're fixing which two are in the pair and which one is single, it's C(3,2) * 2! = 6 per placement.But since we have 6 different placements (as above), each with 6 arrangements, that would be 6 * 6 = 36 ways to arrange the girls with exactly two adjacent.But wait, no, actually, the 6 placements already account for the different positions of the pair and single girl. So, for each of these 6 placements, the girls can be arranged in 6 ways (choosing the pair and arranging them). So, total girl arrangements: 6 * 6 = 36.But wait, that can't be right because the total number of ways to arrange the girls without any restrictions is 5P3 = 60, but with the restriction of exactly two adjacent, it's 36? That seems plausible.But let me check with another approach.The total number of ways to arrange the girls without any restrictions is 5P3 = 60.The number of ways where all three girls are together: treat them as a single block, so we have 3 blocks: the trio, boy A, and boy B. The number of ways to arrange these three blocks is 3! = 6. Within the trio, the girls can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So, total arrangements with all three girls together: 6 * 6 = 36.The number of ways where no two girls are adjacent: we need to place the girls in the row such that none are next to each other. To do this, we can first place the boys and then place the girls in the gaps.There are 2 boys, so they create 3 gaps: before the first boy, between the two boys, and after the second boy. We need to place 3 girls into these 3 gaps, one girl per gap. The number of ways to arrange the boys is 2! = 2. Then, the number of ways to arrange the girls in the gaps is 3! = 6. So, total arrangements with no two girls adjacent: 2 * 6 = 12.Therefore, the number of arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent is total arrangements minus all three together minus none adjacent: 60 - 36 - 12 = 12.Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation of 36. So, which one is correct?Wait, no, actually, the total number of ways to arrange the girls is 5P3 = 60, but that's considering the girls as distinct and the boys as distinct as well. Wait, no, actually, the total number of arrangements is 5! = 120, considering all 5 people.Wait, hold on, maybe I confused the total arrangements.Let me clarify: the total number of ways to arrange 5 people (2 boys and 3 girls) is 5! = 120.The number of arrangements where all three girls are together: treat the three girls as a single block. So, we have three blocks: the trio, boy A, and boy B. The number of ways to arrange these three blocks is 3! = 6. Within the trio, the girls can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. So, total arrangements: 6 * 6 = 36.The number of arrangements where no two girls are adjacent: we can use the gap method. First, arrange the boys, then place the girls in the gaps. There are 2 boys, so they create 3 gaps. We need to place 3 girls into these 3 gaps, one in each. The number of ways to arrange the boys is 2! = 2. The number of ways to arrange the girls in the gaps is 3! = 6. So, total arrangements: 2 * 6 = 12.Therefore, the number of arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent is total arrangements minus all three together minus none adjacent: 120 - 36 - 12 = 72.Wait, so that's 72 arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent.But hold on, this is without considering the restriction on boy A. So, now, we need to subtract the cases where boy A is at either end.So, let's calculate the number of arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent and boy A is at either end, and subtract that from 72.So, first, let's find the number of arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent and boy A is at position 1 or 5.Let's calculate this.Case 1: Boy A is at position 1.Then, we have to arrange the remaining 4 people: boy B and the 3 girls, with the condition that exactly two girls are adjacent.But wait, no, actually, the condition is that exactly two girls are adjacent in the entire row, regardless of where the boys are. So, if boy A is at position 1, we still need to ensure that exactly two girls are adjacent in the remaining positions.So, let's model this.If boy A is at position 1, then the remaining positions are 2,3,4,5, which need to be filled by boy B and the 3 girls, with exactly two girls adjacent.So, let's calculate the number of such arrangements.We have positions 2,3,4,5. We need to arrange boy B and the 3 girls such that exactly two girls are adjacent.So, similar to before, the girls can be arranged as a pair and a single, with the pair not adjacent to the single.But we also have to place boy B somewhere.So, let's think of the entities to arrange: the pair of girls, the single girl, and boy B. That's three entities.We need to arrange these three entities in positions 2,3,4,5 such that the pair and single girl are not adjacent.Wait, but we have four positions and three entities, so one position will be occupied by boy B, and the other three by the girls.Wait, no, actually, the pair of girls takes up two positions, the single girl takes up one, and boy B takes up one. So, total positions: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, which fits.So, the number of ways to arrange these three entities (pair, single, B) in four positions, ensuring that the pair and single are not adjacent.Wait, actually, since the pair takes two consecutive positions, and the single and B take one each, we need to place the pair in such a way that the single is not adjacent to it.So, let's consider the possible placements of the pair in positions 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.Wait, but position 1 is already occupied by boy A, so the pair can't start at position 1.So, possible pair positions:1. Pair in 2-3:   - Then, the single girl can't be in position 4 (adjacent to 3).   - So, single girl can be in position 5.   - Boy B can be in position 4.   So, arrangement: pair in 2-3, single in 5, B in 4.2. Pair in 3-4:   - Single girl can't be in position 2 or 5.   - But position 2 is adjacent to 3, and position 5 is adjacent to 4.   - So, single girl can't be placed. Wait, that's a problem.   Wait, if the pair is in 3-4, then the single girl can't be in 2 or 5 because they are adjacent to the pair. But we only have positions 2,5 left, which are both adjacent. So, this placement is invalid because we can't place the single girl without being adjacent to the pair.   Therefore, pair in 3-4 is not possible.3. Pair in 4-5:   - Single girl can't be in position 3 (adjacent to 4).   - So, single girl can be in position 2.   - Boy B can be in position 3.   So, arrangement: pair in 4-5, single in 2, B in 3.So, only two valid placements for the pair: 2-3 and 4-5.For each of these, let's calculate the number of arrangements.For pair in 2-3:- The pair can be any two girls, arranged in 2! ways. So, C(3,2) * 2! = 3 * 2 = 6.- The single girl is the remaining one, so 1 way.- Boy B is placed in position 4.So, total arrangements for this case: 6 * 1 * 1 = 6.Similarly, for pair in 4-5:- The pair can be any two girls, arranged in 2! ways: 6.- The single girl is the remaining one: 1 way.- Boy B is placed in position 3.Total arrangements: 6 * 1 * 1 = 6.So, total arrangements when boy A is at position 1: 6 + 6 = 12.Similarly, we need to calculate the arrangements when boy A is at position 5.By symmetry, this should be the same as when boy A is at position 1.So, arrangements when boy A is at position 5: 12.Therefore, total arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent and boy A is at either end: 12 + 12 = 24.But wait, hold on, is there any overlap where boy A is at both ends simultaneously? No, because boy A can't be in two places at once, so no overlap.Therefore, the total number of valid arrangements is total arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent (72) minus the arrangements where boy A is at either end (24): 72 - 24 = 48.But wait, hold on, earlier I calculated that the total number of arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent is 72, but that was without considering the restriction on boy A. Then, I subtracted the cases where boy A is at the ends, which was 24, giving 48.But let me verify this with another approach.Alternatively, we can calculate the number of valid arrangements directly by considering the restriction on boy A.So, boy A cannot be at positions 1 or 5, so he must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.Let's consider each case:Case 1: Boy A is in position 2.Then, we need to arrange the remaining 4 people: boy B and the 3 girls in positions 1,3,4,5.We need exactly two girls adjacent in the entire row.So, let's analyze this.Positions 1,3,4,5 need to have boy B and the 3 girls, with exactly two girls adjacent.So, similar to before, we can model the girls as a pair and a single, and boy B as another entity.So, the entities are: pair, single, B.We need to place them in positions 1,3,4,5, ensuring that the pair and single are not adjacent.But since position 2 is occupied by boy A, the adjacency is only within positions 1,3,4,5.Wait, but position 1 is adjacent to position 2 (occupied by A), and position 3 is adjacent to position 2 as well.So, if the pair is placed in positions 3-4, then position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (A), but the pair is in 3-4, which is fine because the condition is about the girls, not about the boys.Wait, no, the condition is about the girls, so as long as exactly two girls are adjacent, regardless of where the boys are.So, let's proceed.We have positions 1,3,4,5.We need to place the pair, single, and B in these positions, ensuring that the pair and single are not adjacent.But since position 2 is occupied by A, the adjacency between position 1 and 3 is broken. So, positions 1 and 3 are not adjacent because position 2 is in between.Similarly, positions 3 and 4 are adjacent, positions 4 and 5 are adjacent.So, the possible placements for the pair:1. Pair in 1-3: Wait, position 1 and 3 are not adjacent because position 2 is in between. So, they can't form a pair.Wait, no, the pair has to be in consecutive positions. So, in positions 1,3,4,5, the possible consecutive pairs are 3-4 and 4-5.So, pair can be in 3-4 or 4-5.Let's consider each:Subcase 1a: Pair in 3-4.Then, the single girl can't be in position 5 (adjacent to 4) or position 2 (occupied by A). So, single girl can be in position 1.Boy B can be in position 5.So, arrangement: pair in 3-4, single in 1, B in 5.Subcase 1b: Pair in 4-5.Then, the single girl can't be in position 3 (adjacent to 4). So, single girl can be in position 1.Boy B can be in position 3.So, arrangement: pair in 4-5, single in 1, B in 3.So, two possible arrangements for the entities.For each, the number of girl arrangements is C(3,2) * 2! = 6.So, total arrangements for this case: 2 * 6 = 12.Case 2: Boy A is in position 3.Then, we need to arrange the remaining 4 people: boy B and the 3 girls in positions 1,2,4,5.Again, we need exactly two girls adjacent.So, let's model this.Positions 1,2,4,5.We need to place the pair, single, and B in these positions, ensuring that the pair and single are not adjacent.Possible consecutive pairs in positions 1,2,4,5 are 1-2 and 4-5.So, pair can be in 1-2 or 4-5.Subcase 2a: Pair in 1-2.Then, the single girl can't be in position 3 (occupied by A) or position 4 (adjacent to 2). So, single girl can be in position 5.Boy B can be in position 4.So, arrangement: pair in 1-2, single in 5, B in 4.Subcase 2b: Pair in 4-5.Then, the single girl can't be in position 3 (occupied by A) or position 2 (adjacent to 4). So, single girl can be in position 1.Boy B can be in position 2.So, arrangement: pair in 4-5, single in 1, B in 2.So, two possible arrangements.For each, the number of girl arrangements is 6.Total arrangements for this case: 2 * 6 = 12.Case 3: Boy A is in position 4.This is symmetrical to Case 1 where boy A was in position 2.So, let's see.Positions 1,2,3,5 need to be filled by boy B and the 3 girls.Possible consecutive pairs: 1-2, 2-3.Subcase 3a: Pair in 1-2.Then, single girl can't be in position 3 (adjacent to 2). So, single girl can be in position 5.Boy B can be in position 3.Arrangement: pair in 1-2, single in 5, B in 3.Subcase 3b: Pair in 2-3.Then, single girl can't be in position 1 (adjacent to 2). So, single girl can be in position 5.Boy B can be in position 1.Arrangement: pair in 2-3, single in 5, B in 1.So, two possible arrangements.For each, the number of girl arrangements is 6.Total arrangements for this case: 2 * 6 = 12.Therefore, total arrangements when boy A is in positions 2,3,4: 12 + 12 + 12 = 36.Wait, but earlier I calculated that the total number of arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent is 72, and the number of arrangements with boy A at the ends is 24, so 72 - 24 = 48. But now, by directly calculating the valid arrangements, I get 36. There's a discrepancy here.Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Let me check.When I calculated the total number of arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent as 72, that was without considering the restriction on boy A. Then, I subtracted the cases where boy A was at the ends, which was 24, giving 48. But when I directly calculated the valid arrangements, I got 36.So, which one is correct?Wait, let's think about it. When I directly calculated the arrangements with boy A in positions 2,3,4, I got 36. But when I subtracted the cases where boy A was at the ends from the total arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent, I got 48.This suggests that my initial approach was incorrect.Wait, perhaps the total number of arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent is not 72, but actually 36.Wait, let's recast the problem.The total number of arrangements is 5! = 120.Number of arrangements where all three girls are together: 3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36.Number of arrangements where no two girls are adjacent: 2! * C(3,3) * 3! = 2 * 1 * 6 = 12.Wait, no, actually, the number of arrangements where no two girls are adjacent is calculated as follows:First, arrange the boys: 2! = 2.This creates 3 gaps: _ B _ B _.We need to place 3 girls into these 3 gaps, one in each. The number of ways is 3! = 6.So, total arrangements: 2 * 6 = 12.Therefore, the number of arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent is 120 - 36 - 12 = 72.So, that part is correct.But when I directly calculated the arrangements with boy A not at the ends, I got 36, which is exactly half of 72. That suggests that in half of the arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent, boy A is at the ends, and in the other half, he's not.But that doesn't make sense because boy A is just one of the two boys, so his position isn't necessarily equally likely to be at the ends or not.Wait, perhaps the error is in the direct calculation.When I considered boy A in position 2, I got 12 arrangements. Similarly for positions 3 and 4, each giving 12. But that's 36 total.But according to the earlier calculation, the total number of arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent is 72, so 36 is exactly half.But why is that?Wait, perhaps because when considering the positions of boy A, half of the arrangements have him at the ends, and half have him in the middle.But actually, the number of arrangements where boy A is at the ends is 24, as calculated earlier, and the number where he's in the middle is 48.Wait, but in the direct calculation, I only got 36.So, perhaps my direct calculation is wrong.Wait, let me think again.When I placed boy A in position 2, I considered the arrangements of the remaining 4 people, which included boy B and the 3 girls, with exactly two girls adjacent.But in that case, I found 12 arrangements.Similarly for positions 3 and 4, each giving 12, totaling 36.But according to the earlier calculation, the total number of arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent is 72, and the number with boy A at the ends is 24, so the number with boy A in the middle should be 72 - 24 = 48.So, where is the discrepancy?Wait, perhaps when I placed boy A in position 2, I didn't consider all possible arrangements.Wait, in the first approach, when boy A is in position 2, the remaining positions are 1,3,4,5.We need to arrange boy B and the 3 girls in these positions, with exactly two girls adjacent.But in my calculation, I considered the pair of girls as a block, and found two possible placements for the pair: 3-4 and 4-5, each giving 6 arrangements.But perhaps there are more possibilities.Wait, let's think again.In positions 1,3,4,5, we have to place the pair, single, and B.The pair can be in 3-4 or 4-5, as consecutive positions.But what about the single girl? If the pair is in 3-4, the single girl can be in 1 or 5, but not adjacent to the pair.Wait, position 1 is not adjacent to 3-4 because position 2 is occupied by A.Similarly, position 5 is adjacent to 4, so single girl can't be in 5 if the pair is in 3-4.Wait, no, position 5 is adjacent to 4, which is part of the pair in 3-4. So, single girl can't be in 5.Similarly, if the pair is in 4-5, the single girl can't be in 3.So, in both cases, the single girl has only one position available.But wait, in my initial calculation, I considered only the pair in 3-4 and 4-5, each giving one position for the single girl.But perhaps there's another way.Wait, maybe the pair can also be in 1-3? But 1 and 3 are not consecutive, so they can't form a pair.Similarly, 1-4, 1-5, etc., are not consecutive.So, only 3-4 and 4-5 are possible.Therefore, only two placements for the pair, each giving one position for the single girl.So, 2 * 6 = 12 arrangements for boy A in position 2.Similarly for positions 3 and 4.So, 36 total.But according to the earlier calculation, it should be 48.So, where is the mistake?Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the total number of arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent is 72 is wrong.Wait, let's recast the problem.The total number of arrangements is 5! = 120.Number of arrangements where all three girls are together: 3! * 3! = 36.Number of arrangements where no two girls are adjacent: 2! * C(3,3) * 3! = 12.Therefore, arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent: 120 - 36 - 12 = 72.So, that's correct.Now, the number of arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent and boy A is at either end: 24.Therefore, the number of arrangements where exactly two girls are adjacent and boy A is not at either end: 72 - 24 = 48.But when I directly calculated the arrangements with boy A in positions 2,3,4, I got 36.So, there's a discrepancy of 12.Wait, perhaps I missed some arrangements when directly calculating.Wait, let's consider when boy A is in position 3.In that case, the remaining positions are 1,2,4,5.We can have the pair in 1-2 or 4-5.But perhaps there's another possibility where the pair is in 2-3, but position 3 is occupied by A, so that's not possible.Wait, no, the pair has to be in consecutive positions, and position 3 is occupied by A, so pair can't include position 3.So, only pair in 1-2 or 4-5.So, two possibilities, each giving 6 arrangements, totaling 12.Similarly for the other cases.So, 36 total.But according to the earlier calculation, it should be 48.Wait, perhaps the error is that when I calculated the arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent, I didn't consider that boy A could be in the middle in some of those arrangements.Wait, no, the 72 arrangements include all possible positions of the boys, including when boy A is in the middle.So, when I subtract the 24 arrangements where boy A is at the ends, I should get 48 arrangements where boy A is in the middle.But when I directly calculated, I only got 36.So, perhaps my direct calculation is wrong.Wait, let me try a different approach.Let me calculate the number of valid arrangements by considering the positions of the boys first.We have two boys: A and B.Boy A cannot be at the ends, so he must be in positions 2,3,4.Let's consider each case:Case 1: Boy A is in position 2.Then, boy B can be in positions 1,3,4,5.But we need exactly two girls adjacent.So, let's consider each possible position for boy B.Subcase 1a: Boy B is in position 1.Then, the remaining positions are 3,4,5, which need to be filled by the 3 girls.But we need exactly two girls adjacent.So, in positions 3,4,5, we have three girls.The number of ways to arrange them with exactly two adjacent.This is similar to arranging three girls in three positions with exactly two adjacent.Wait, but in three positions, if all three are girls, either all three are together, or exactly two are adjacent.Wait, but in three positions, the only way to have exactly two adjacent is to have two together and one separate, but since it's three positions, the third girl has to be adjacent to the pair, forming a trio. So, actually, it's impossible to have exactly two adjacent girls in three positions.Therefore, if boy B is in position 1, the girls are in positions 3,4,5, which must all be together, violating the condition of exactly two adjacent.Therefore, this subcase is invalid.Subcase 1b: Boy B is in position 3.Then, the remaining positions are 1,4,5, which need to be filled by the 3 girls.We need exactly two girls adjacent.So, in positions 1,4,5, we have three girls.But positions 1,4,5 are not all consecutive. Positions 4 and 5 are consecutive, position 1 is separate.So, we can have a pair in 4-5, and the single girl in 1.So, the pair is in 4-5, single in 1.Number of arrangements: C(3,2) * 2! = 6.So, total arrangements: 6.Subcase 1c: Boy B is in position 4.Then, the remaining positions are 1,3,5, which need to be filled by the 3 girls.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 1,3,5, the only possible adjacent pair is none, because positions 1 and 3 are separated by position 2 (occupied by A), and positions 3 and 5 are separated by position 4 (occupied by B). So, all girls are isolated, which violates the condition of exactly two adjacent.Therefore, this subcase is invalid.Subcase 1d: Boy B is in position 5.Then, the remaining positions are 1,3,4, which need to be filled by the 3 girls.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 1,3,4, the possible pairs are 3-4.So, pair in 3-4, single in 1.Number of arrangements: 6.So, total arrangements for this subcase: 6.Therefore, total arrangements when boy A is in position 2: 6 (Subcase 1b) + 6 (Subcase 1d) = 12.Case 2: Boy A is in position 3.Then, boy B can be in positions 1,2,4,5.Subcase 2a: Boy B is in position 1.Remaining positions: 2,4,5.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 2,4,5, the possible pairs are 4-5.So, pair in 4-5, single in 2.Number of arrangements: 6.Subcase 2b: Boy B is in position 2.Remaining positions: 1,4,5.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 1,4,5, the possible pairs are 4-5.So, pair in 4-5, single in 1.Number of arrangements: 6.Subcase 2c: Boy B is in position 4.Remaining positions: 1,2,5.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 1,2,5, the possible pairs are 1-2.So, pair in 1-2, single in 5.Number of arrangements: 6.Subcase 2d: Boy B is in position 5.Remaining positions: 1,2,4.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 1,2,4, the possible pairs are 1-2.So, pair in 1-2, single in 4.Number of arrangements: 6.Therefore, total arrangements for this case: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24.Wait, that's different from my previous calculation.Wait, no, actually, in this case, when boy A is in position 3, and boy B is in positions 1,2,4,5, each subcase gives 6 arrangements, so 4 subcases * 6 = 24.But earlier, when I considered boy A in position 3, I thought there were only 12 arrangements. So, this suggests that my previous approach was wrong.Wait, let's see.In this approach, when boy A is in position 3, and boy B is in position 1, we have pair in 4-5, single in 2.Similarly, when boy B is in position 2, pair in 4-5, single in 1.When boy B is in position 4, pair in 1-2, single in 5.When boy B is in position 5, pair in 1-2, single in 4.Each of these gives 6 arrangements, so 24 total.But earlier, when I considered boy A in position 3, I thought there were only 12 arrangements. So, which is correct?Wait, perhaps in this approach, I'm considering all possible positions for boy B, and for each, calculating the number of girl arrangements.So, 24 seems correct.Case 3: Boy A is in position 4.This is symmetrical to Case 1 where boy A was in position 2.So, let's see.Subcase 3a: Boy B is in position 1.Remaining positions: 2,3,5.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 2,3,5, the possible pairs are 2-3.So, pair in 2-3, single in 5.Number of arrangements: 6.Subcase 3b: Boy B is in position 2.Remaining positions: 1,3,5.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 1,3,5, the possible pairs are none, because positions 1 and 3 are separated by position 2 (occupied by B), and positions 3 and 5 are separated by position 4 (occupied by A). So, all girls are isolated, which is invalid.Subcase 3c: Boy B is in position 3.Remaining positions: 1,2,5.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 1,2,5, the possible pairs are 1-2.So, pair in 1-2, single in 5.Number of arrangements: 6.Subcase 3d: Boy B is in position 5.Remaining positions: 1,2,3.We need exactly two girls adjacent.In positions 1,2,3, the possible pairs are 1-2 or 2-3.But since we need exactly two adjacent, we can have pair in 1-2, single in 3, or pair in 2-3, single in 1.But wait, in this case, the girls are in positions 1,2,3, which are consecutive.If we have pair in 1-2, single in 3: this is valid.If we have pair in 2-3, single in 1: this is also valid.So, each of these gives 6 arrangements, so total 12.Wait, but in this subcase, boy B is in position 5, so the girls are in 1,2,3.So, the number of arrangements is 2 * 6 = 12.Wait, but earlier, I thought that in three positions, you can't have exactly two girls adjacent without forming a trio, but actually, you can have two adjacent and one separate, but in three consecutive positions, the third girl is adjacent to the pair, forming a trio.Wait, no, in three consecutive positions, if you have two girls together and one separate, the separate one is adjacent to the pair, forming a trio.Therefore, in three consecutive positions, it's impossible to have exactly two girls adjacent without the third being adjacent as well.Therefore, in this subcase, it's impossible to have exactly two girls adjacent.Therefore, this subcase is invalid.Wait, so in Subcase 3d, when boy B is in position 5, the girls are in positions 1,2,3, which are consecutive. Therefore, we can't have exactly two girls adjacent without forming a trio. So, this subcase is invalid.Therefore, total arrangements for this case: 6 (Subcase 3a) + 6 (Subcase 3c) = 12.So, total arrangements when boy A is in position 4: 12.Therefore, total arrangements when boy A is in positions 2,3,4: 12 (Case 1) + 24 (Case 2) + 12 (Case 3) = 48.Ah, so that matches the earlier calculation: 72 total arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent, minus 24 where boy A is at the ends, giving 48.Therefore, the correct number of arrangements is 48.But wait, in my initial direct calculation, I only got 36 because I didn't consider all possible positions for boy B when boy A was in position 3.So, the correct answer is 48.But let me verify once more.Total arrangements with exactly two girls adjacent: 72.Number of these where boy A is at the ends: 24.Therefore, arrangements where boy A is not at the ends: 72 - 24 = 48.Yes, that seems correct.Therefore, the number of different arrangements is 48.**Final Answer**The number of different arrangements is boxed{48}."},{"question":"In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n. Given that S_2=9 and S_4=22, find S_8.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to remember what I know about arithmetic sequences. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. So, if I denote the first term as ( a_1 ) and the common difference as ( d ), then the nth term ( a_n ) can be written as ( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d ).The problem says that the sum of the first ( n ) terms is ( S_n ). It gives me that ( S_2 = 9 ) and ( S_4 = 22 ), and it asks me to find ( S_8 ). Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.I remember that the sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:[S_n = frac{n}{2} times (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)]Alternatively, it can also be written as:[S_n = frac{n}{2} times (a_1 + a_n)]Since ( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d ), both formulas are equivalent.So, given that ( S_2 = 9 ) and ( S_4 = 22 ), I can set up two equations and solve for ( a_1 ) and ( d ). Once I have those, I can compute ( S_8 ).Let me write down the equations.First, for ( n = 2 ):[S_2 = frac{2}{2} times (2a_1 + (2 - 1)d) = 1 times (2a_1 + d) = 2a_1 + d = 9]So, equation 1 is:[2a_1 + d = 9 quad (1)]Next, for ( n = 4 ):[S_4 = frac{4}{2} times (2a_1 + (4 - 1)d) = 2 times (2a_1 + 3d) = 4a_1 + 6d = 22]So, equation 2 is:[4a_1 + 6d = 22 quad (2)]Now, I have a system of two equations with two variables. Let me write them again:1. ( 2a_1 + d = 9 )2. ( 4a_1 + 6d = 22 )I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.First, let me multiply equation (1) by 2 to make the coefficients of ( a_1 ) the same:Multiplying equation (1) by 2:[4a_1 + 2d = 18 quad (3)]Now, subtract equation (3) from equation (2):[(4a_1 + 6d) - (4a_1 + 2d) = 22 - 18]Simplify:[4a_1 + 6d - 4a_1 - 2d = 4]Which simplifies to:[4d = 4]So, ( d = 1 ).Now that I have ( d = 1 ), I can substitute this back into equation (1) to find ( a_1 ).Substituting ( d = 1 ) into equation (1):[2a_1 + 1 = 9]Subtract 1 from both sides:[2a_1 = 8]Divide both sides by 2:[a_1 = 4]So, the first term ( a_1 ) is 4, and the common difference ( d ) is 1.Now, I need to find ( S_8 ). Using the sum formula again:[S_8 = frac{8}{2} times (2a_1 + (8 - 1)d) = 4 times (2 times 4 + 7 times 1) = 4 times (8 + 7) = 4 times 15 = 60]Wait, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Calculating ( S_8 ):First, ( 2a_1 = 2 times 4 = 8 ).Then, ( (8 - 1)d = 7 times 1 = 7 ).Adding them together: ( 8 + 7 = 15 ).Multiply by ( frac{8}{2} = 4 ): ( 4 times 15 = 60 ).Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the other sum formula:[S_n = frac{n}{2} times (a_1 + a_n)]First, find ( a_8 ):[a_8 = a_1 + (8 - 1)d = 4 + 7 times 1 = 11]Then, ( S_8 = frac{8}{2} times (4 + 11) = 4 times 15 = 60 ). Same result.Wait, but just to make sure, let me verify the initial conditions with ( a_1 = 4 ) and ( d = 1 ).Compute ( S_2 ):First two terms: 4 and 5. Sum is 4 + 5 = 9. That's correct.Compute ( S_4 ):First four terms: 4, 5, 6, 7. Sum is 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22. That's correct.So, seems like everything checks out. Therefore, ( S_8 = 60 ).But just to be thorough, let me write out all the terms up to the 8th term and add them up.1st term: 42nd term: 53rd term: 64th term: 75th term: 86th term: 97th term: 108th term: 11Adding them up: 4 + 5 = 9; 9 + 6 = 15; 15 + 7 = 22; 22 + 8 = 30; 30 + 9 = 39; 39 + 10 = 49; 49 + 11 = 60.Yep, that's 60. So, I'm confident that ( S_8 = 60 ).**Final Answer**The sum of the first 8 terms is boxed{60}."},{"question":"The pie charts below indicate the percent of students who prefer golf, bowling, or tennis at East Junior High School and West Middle School.

If 25% prefer tennis, then the number of students who prefer tennis is 2000 multiplied by 0.25, which equals 500 students.For West Middle School, there are 2500 students. If 28% prefer tennis, then the number of students who prefer tennis is 2500 multiplied by 0.28, which equals 700 students.Next, I'll add the number of students who prefer tennis from both schools: 500 plus 700 equals 1200 students.The total number of students at both schools combined is 2000 plus 2500, which equals 4500 students.Finally, to find the percentage of students who prefer tennis in both schools combined, I'll divide the total number of students who prefer tennis (1200) by the total number of students (4500) and multiply by 100. This calculation gives approximately 26.67%, which rounds to 27%.However, since 26.67% is closer to 27%, the correct answer should be 27%.

When these triangles are folded up, they form a pyramid with the square as the base, and the height of the pyramid is 4 cm. I need to find the total area of the four triangles and the square.First, let me visualize this. The square is the base, and each side of the square has a triangle attached to it. These triangles are identical and isosceles, so each triangle must have two equal sides. When folded, the apexes of the triangles meet at a single point above the square, forming the pyramid.So, the total area they're asking for is the area of the square plus the areas of the four triangles. Since the triangles are identical, I can find the area of one triangle and multiply it by four.Let me break it down step by step.1. **Area of the square**: That's straightforward. The side length is 6 cm, so area is side squared.   Area_square = 6 cm * 6 cm = 36 cm².2. **Area of each triangle**: To find this, I need to know the base and the height of each triangle. The base of each triangle is the same as the side of the square, which is 6 cm. But I need the height of the triangle.   Wait, but when the triangles are folded up, they form the pyramid. The height of the pyramid is given as 4 cm. So, perhaps the height of each triangle is related to the slant height of the pyramid?   Hmm, let me think. When the triangles are folded up, the height of the triangle becomes the slant height of the pyramid. So, the slant height (let's call it 'l') can be found using the height of the pyramid and half the length of the base.   Wait, actually, in a square pyramid, the slant height is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of one of the base edges. So, if I can find the slant height, that would be the height of each triangle.   Let me recall the formula for slant height. In a square pyramid, the slant height (l) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, considering the height of the pyramid (h) and half the length of the base (b/2).   So, slant height l = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + h^2 )   Wait, no, that's not quite right. The slant height is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the height of the pyramid, and the other leg is half the length of the base.   So, actually, l = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + h^2 )   Wait, no, hold on. Let me correct that. The slant height is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge. So, if I consider the triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, half the base length, and the slant height, it's a right triangle.   So, yes, l = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + h^2 )   Wait, no, actually, the slant height is calculated differently. Let me think again.   The height of the pyramid is 4 cm, and the base is a square with side 6 cm. So, the distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of one of its sides is half of 6 cm, which is 3 cm.   So, if I consider the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid (4 cm), the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side (3 cm), and the slant height (l), then:   l = sqrt( (3 cm)^2 + (4 cm)^2 ) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5 cm.   So, the slant height is 5 cm. Therefore, the height of each triangle is 5 cm.   Wait, hold on. The slant height is 5 cm, which is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge. But each triangle is attached to a side of the square, so the height of the triangle is actually the slant height, right?   Because when folded, the height of the triangle becomes the slant height of the pyramid.   So, each triangle has a base of 6 cm and a height of 5 cm.   Therefore, the area of each triangle is (base * height)/2 = (6 cm * 5 cm)/2 = 15 cm².   Since there are four triangles, the total area of the triangles is 4 * 15 cm² = 60 cm².   Then, adding the area of the square, which is 36 cm², the total area is 60 + 36 = 96 cm².   Hmm, 96 cm² is one of the options, option C.   Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes it's easy to mix up the slant height and the triangle's height.   So, the slant height is 5 cm, which is the height of the triangle when it's folded up. So, each triangle has a base of 6 cm and a height of 5 cm, so area is indeed 15 cm² each.   So, four triangles would be 60 cm², plus the square's 36 cm², totaling 96 cm².   That seems correct.   Alternatively, let me think about the triangles before folding. They are attached to the square, so their base is 6 cm, and their height is 5 cm, as we found.   So, each triangle's area is (6*5)/2 = 15, four of them is 60, plus 36 is 96.   So, I think 96 cm² is the answer, which is option C.   But wait, let me think again. Is the height of the triangle equal to the slant height?   Because when the triangle is folded, the height of the triangle becomes the slant edge of the pyramid. So, yes, the height of the triangle is the slant height.   So, I think my reasoning is correct.   Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area of the four triangles another way.   The four triangles make up the lateral faces of the pyramid. The lateral surface area of a pyramid is the perimeter of the base times the slant height divided by 2.   So, lateral surface area = (perimeter * slant height)/2.   The perimeter of the base is 4 * 6 cm = 24 cm.   Slant height is 5 cm, so lateral surface area = (24 * 5)/2 = 60 cm².   So, that's the same as the total area of the four triangles.   Then, adding the base area, which is 36 cm², gives 96 cm² total.   So, that confirms it.   Therefore, the answer should be 96 cm², which is option C.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given the circumference of a sector is 8cm, the maximum value of the area S of this sector is ______ cm<sup>2</sup>.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Given the circumference of a sector is 8 cm, I need to find the maximum value of the area S of this sector. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, let me recall what a sector is. A sector is a portion of a circle bounded by two radii and an arc. The circumference of the sector would then be the sum of the two radii and the length of the arc. So, if I denote the radius as r and the central angle as θ (in radians), the circumference C of the sector is given by:C = 2r + arc lengthI remember that the arc length L of a sector is given by L = rθ. So substituting that into the circumference equation:C = 2r + rθThe problem states that the circumference is 8 cm, so:2r + rθ = 8I can factor out an r:r(2 + θ) = 8So, that gives me an equation relating r and θ. I need to find the maximum area S of the sector. The area of a sector is given by:S = (1/2) r² θSo, my goal is to maximize S = (1/2) r² θ, given that 2r + rθ = 8.This seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. I can use calculus to maximize S with respect to one variable, either r or θ, by expressing one variable in terms of the other using the constraint.Let me solve the constraint equation for θ in terms of r. From 2r + rθ = 8:rθ = 8 - 2rSo,θ = (8 - 2r)/rSimplify that:θ = 8/r - 2Okay, so now I can substitute this expression for θ into the area formula:S = (1/2) r² θ = (1/2) r² (8/r - 2)Let me simplify this expression step by step.First, distribute r² into the parentheses:S = (1/2) [ r² * (8/r) - r² * 2 ]Simplify each term:r² * (8/r) = 8rr² * 2 = 2r²So, substituting back:S = (1/2)(8r - 2r²)Now, distribute the 1/2:S = (1/2)*8r - (1/2)*2r²Simplify each term:(1/2)*8r = 4r(1/2)*2r² = r²So, the area S is:S = 4r - r²Hmm, so S is a quadratic function in terms of r. It's a quadratic equation of the form S = -r² + 4r. Since the coefficient of r² is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.To find the maximum value, I can find the vertex of this parabola. The vertex occurs at r = -b/(2a) for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c. In this case, a = -1 and b = 4.So,r = -b/(2a) = -4/(2*(-1)) = -4/(-2) = 2So, the radius r that gives the maximum area is 2 cm.Now, let me find the corresponding θ. From earlier, θ = 8/r - 2.Substituting r = 2:θ = 8/2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 radians.So, θ is 2 radians. That makes sense because when the central angle is equal to 2 radians, which is approximately 114.59 degrees, the sector area is maximized.Now, let me compute the maximum area S using r = 2 and θ = 2.S = (1/2) r² θ = (1/2) * (2)² * 2Calculate step by step:(2)² = 44 * 2 = 88 * (1/2) = 4So, the maximum area S is 4 cm².Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting from the constraint:2r + rθ = 8With r = 2, θ = 2:2*2 + 2*2 = 4 + 4 = 8, which matches the given circumference.Area calculation:(1/2)*r²*θ = (1/2)*4*2 = (1/2)*8 = 4 cm². That seems correct.Alternatively, I can use calculus to confirm this result. Let's take the derivative of S with respect to r and set it to zero to find the critical points.Given S = 4r - r²dS/dr = 4 - 2rSet derivative equal to zero:4 - 2r = 02r = 4r = 2So, r = 2 is indeed the critical point. To confirm it's a maximum, I can check the second derivative:d²S/dr² = -2Since the second derivative is negative, the function is concave down, so r = 2 gives a maximum.Therefore, the maximum area is 4 cm².Alternatively, I can think about this problem in terms of maximizing the area with a fixed perimeter (circumference). In optimization problems, often the maximum area is achieved when the shape is as \\"balanced\\" as possible. For a sector, this would mean that the arc length is equal to the sum of the two radii.Wait, in this case, the circumference is 8 cm, which is 2r + rθ. If I set the arc length equal to the sum of the two radii, that would mean:rθ = 2rWhich simplifies to θ = 2 radians, which is exactly what I found earlier. So, when θ = 2, the arc length equals the sum of the two radii, which seems to give the maximum area.This also makes sense because if θ were larger, the radius would have to be smaller to keep the circumference constant, which might not necessarily maximize the area. Similarly, if θ were smaller, the radius would be larger, but the area depends on both r and θ in a quadratic and linear fashion, respectively.So, through multiple approaches—solving algebraically, using calculus, and considering the balance between arc length and radius—I arrive at the conclusion that the maximum area is 4 cm².Just to recap:1. Start with the circumference equation: 2r + rθ = 82. Express θ in terms of r: θ = 8/r - 23. Substitute θ into the area formula: S = (1/2)r²θ = 4r - r²4. Find the maximum of S by taking the derivative or recognizing the quadratic form5. Determine that r = 2 cm gives the maximum area6. Calculate S = 4 cm²Everything checks out. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the maximum area is indeed 4 cm².**Final Answer**The maximum value of the area ( S ) of the sector is boxed{4} cm²."},{"question":"In a certain region, there are three chicken farms, _A_, _B_, and _C_, with chicken populations of 12,000, 8,000, and 4,000, respectively. To prevent avian influenza, a stratified sampling method is used to draw a sample of 120 chickens for inspection. The number of chickens drawn from farms _A_, _B_, and _C_ are respectively ______, ______, and ______.","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of chickens across all three farms. Farm A has 12,000 chickens, Farm B has 8,000, and Farm C has 4,000. Adding these together gives a total of 24,000 chickens.Next, I'll calculate the proportion of chickens each farm contributes to the total population. For Farm A, the proportion is 12,000 divided by 24,000, which equals 0.5. For Farm B, it's 8,000 divided by 24,000, resulting in 0.333. For Farm C, the proportion is 4,000 divided by 24,000, which is 0.167.Now, I'll apply these proportions to the total sample size of 120 chickens. Multiplying 120 by 0.5 gives 60 chickens from Farm A. Multiplying 120 by 0.333 results in approximately 40 chickens from Farm B. Finally, multiplying 120 by 0.167 gives about 20 chickens from Farm C.Therefore, the number of chickens to be drawn from each farm is 60 from Farm A, 40 from Farm B, and 20 from Farm C."},{"question":"Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan.

Let me try to visualize it first. There's a square ABCD that's 2x2. Let me label the points: A is at the top-left, B is at the bottom-left, C is at the bottom-right, and D is at the top-right. So, the square is drawn with coordinates: A(0,2), B(0,0), C(2,0), D(2,2). E is the midpoint of AB. Since AB goes from (0,2) to (0,0), the midpoint E would be at (0,1). Similarly, F is the midpoint of BC, which goes from (0,0) to (2,0), so F is at (1,0). Now, the problem mentions lines AF and DE intersecting at I, and lines BD and AF intersecting at H. I need to find the area of quadrilateral BEIH. The answer choices are fractions, so I think coordinate geometry might be a good approach here.Let me write down the coordinates of all the points:- A: (0,2)- B: (0,0)- C: (2,0)- D: (2,2)- E: (0,1)- F: (1,0)First, I need to find the equations of the lines AF, DE, and BD because their intersections will give me points H and I.Starting with line AF: It goes from A(0,2) to F(1,0). Let's find its equation. The slope (m) is (0 - 2)/(1 - 0) = -2. So, the equation is y - 2 = -2(x - 0), which simplifies to y = -2x + 2.Next, line DE: It goes from D(2,2) to E(0,1). The slope here is (1 - 2)/(0 - 2) = (-1)/(-2) = 1/2. So, the equation is y - 2 = (1/2)(x - 2). Simplifying that: y = (1/2)x + 1.Now, the intersection point I of AF and DE. So, set the equations equal to each other:-2x + 2 = (1/2)x + 1Let me solve for x:-2x - (1/2)x = 1 - 2- (5/2)x = -1Multiply both sides by (-2/5):x = (-1)*(-2/5) = 2/5Now, plug x = 2/5 into one of the equations, say y = -2x + 2:y = -2*(2/5) + 2 = -4/5 + 10/5 = 6/5So, point I is at (2/5, 6/5).Next, let's find point H, which is the intersection of BD and AF. First, I need the equation of BD. BD goes from B(0,0) to D(2,2). The slope is (2 - 0)/(2 - 0) = 1. So, the equation is y = x.We already have the equation of AF: y = -2x + 2. So, set them equal:x = -2x + 23x = 2x = 2/3Then, y = 2/3. So, point H is at (2/3, 2/3).Now, I have all the necessary points:- B: (0,0)- E: (0,1)- I: (2/5, 6/5)- H: (2/3, 2/3)I need to find the area of quadrilateral BEIH. Let me plot these points mentally:- B is at the origin.- E is straight up along the y-axis to (0,1).- I is somewhere in the middle, at (2/5, 6/5), which is (0.4, 1.2).- H is at (2/3, 2/3), which is approximately (0.666, 0.666).So, quadrilateral BEIH is a four-sided figure connecting these points in order. To find its area, I can use the shoelace formula, which is suitable for polygons when you know the coordinates of the vertices.Let me list the coordinates in order: B(0,0), E(0,1), I(2/5, 6/5), H(2/3, 2/3). I should ensure that the points are listed in a clockwise or counter-clockwise order without crossing. Let me check:From B(0,0) to E(0,1): vertical line up.From E(0,1) to I(2/5, 6/5): moving right and up a bit.From I(2/5, 6/5) to H(2/3, 2/3): moving right and down.From H(2/3, 2/3) back to B(0,0): moving left and down.This seems to form a quadrilateral without crossing, so the shoelace formula should work.The shoelace formula is:Area = 1/2 |sum over i (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|Let me set up the coordinates in order and repeat the first at the end:B: (0,0)E: (0,1)I: (2/5, 6/5)H: (2/3, 2/3)B: (0,0)Now, compute the sum:First, x_i y_{i+1} terms:0*1 + 0*(6/5) + (2/5)*(2/3) + (2/3)*0= 0 + 0 + (4/15) + 0 = 4/15Next, x_{i+1} y_i terms:0*0 + 1*(2/5) + (6/5)*(2/3) + (2/3)*0= 0 + (2/5) + (12/15) + 0Simplify:2/5 is 6/15, and 12/15 is 12/15. So total is 6/15 + 12/15 = 18/15Now, subtract the two sums:|4/15 - 18/15| = | -14/15 | = 14/15Then, multiply by 1/2:Area = (1/2)*(14/15) = 7/15Wait, but 7/15 is one of the answer choices, option C. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the shoelace steps.Let me write down the coordinates again:B: (0,0)E: (0,1)I: (2/5, 6/5)H: (2/3, 2/3)B: (0,0)Compute the products:First, x_i * y_{i+1}:0*1 = 00*(6/5) = 0(2/5)*(2/3) = 4/15(2/3)*0 = 0Total: 0 + 0 + 4/15 + 0 = 4/15Then, y_i * x_{i+1}:0*0 = 01*(2/5) = 2/5(6/5)*(2/3) = (12/15) = 4/5(2/3)*0 = 0Total: 0 + 2/5 + 4/5 + 0 = (2/5 + 4/5) = 6/5Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here earlier. The shoelace formula is |sum(x_i y_{i+1}) - sum(y_i x_{i+1})|.So, in my first calculation, I had 4/15 - 18/15, but actually, the second sum is 6/5, which is 18/15. So, 4/15 - 18/15 = -14/15, absolute value is 14/15, then 1/2 of that is 7/15. So, that seems correct.But wait, 6/5 is 18/15? Wait, 6/5 is 18/15? No, 6/5 is 18/15? Wait, 6/5 is equal to 18/15? Let me check:6/5 = (6*3)/(5*3) = 18/15. Yes, that's correct. So, 6/5 is 18/15.So, 4/15 - 18/15 = -14/15, absolute value 14/15, times 1/2 is 7/15. So, the area is 7/15, which is option C.But wait, the answer choices are:(A) 1/3 ≈ 0.333(B) 2/5 = 0.4(C) 7/15 ≈ 0.466(D) 8/15 ≈ 0.533(E) 3/5 = 0.6So, 7/15 is approximately 0.466, which is option C.But let me think again. Maybe I should use another method to verify. Maybe breaking the quadrilateral into triangles or something else.Alternatively, I can use coordinate geometry to find the area by subtracting areas of other regions.Looking at the figure, quadrilateral BEIH is bounded by points B, E, I, H.Alternatively, maybe I can divide BEIH into two triangles: BEI and BIH.Compute the area of each triangle and sum them.First, triangle BEI: points B(0,0), E(0,1), I(2/5,6/5).Using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates:Area = 1/2 | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |Plugging in:x1=0, y1=0; x2=0, y2=1; x3=2/5, y3=6/5Area = 1/2 | 0*(1 - 6/5) + 0*(6/5 - 0) + (2/5)*(0 - 1) |= 1/2 | 0 + 0 + (2/5)*(-1) | = 1/2 | -2/5 | = 1/2 * 2/5 = 1/5So, area of triangle BEI is 1/5.Next, triangle BIH: points B(0,0), I(2/5,6/5), H(2/3,2/3).Using the same formula:Area = 1/2 | x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |Plugging in:x1=0, y1=0; x2=2/5, y2=6/5; x3=2/3, y3=2/3Compute each term:0*(6/5 - 2/3) = 0(2/5)*(2/3 - 0) = (2/5)*(2/3) = 4/15(2/3)*(0 - 6/5) = (2/3)*(-6/5) = -12/15So, sum is 0 + 4/15 - 12/15 = (-8/15)Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2:Area = 1/2 * | -8/15 | = 1/2 * 8/15 = 4/15So, area of triangle BIH is 4/15.Adding the two areas: 1/5 + 4/15 = 3/15 + 4/15 = 7/15.Same result as before. So, that confirms the area is 7/15, which is option C.But wait, let me think again. The shoelace formula gave me 7/15, and breaking into triangles also gave me 7/15. So, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe using vectors or determinants. But I think the methods I've used are solid.Alternatively, I can use the area of the square and subtract the areas of the regions not included in BEIH.But that might be more complicated.Alternatively, I can use parametric equations for the lines and integrate, but that's overkill.Alternatively, since all the points are defined by intersections, maybe I can find the ratios in which the lines divide each other and use area ratios.But since I already have the coordinates, and both methods gave me 7/15, I think that's the correct answer.Wait, but let me check the shoelace formula again step by step because sometimes I might have messed up the order.Listing the coordinates in order: B(0,0), E(0,1), I(2/5,6/5), H(2/3,2/3), back to B(0,0).Compute the sum of x_i y_{i+1}:0*1 + 0*(6/5) + (2/5)*(2/3) + (2/3)*0 = 0 + 0 + (4/15) + 0 = 4/15Compute the sum of y_i x_{i+1}:0*0 + 1*(2/5) + (6/5)*(2/3) + (2/3)*0 = 0 + (2/5) + (12/15) + 0Simplify:2/5 is 6/15, and 12/15 is 12/15. So, total is 6/15 + 12/15 = 18/15 = 6/5.So, the shoelace formula gives |4/15 - 18/15| = | -14/15 | = 14/15. Multiply by 1/2: 7/15.Yes, that's correct. So, quadrilateral BEIH has an area of 7/15.Therefore, the answer is C) 7/15.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Given that a and b are opposite numbers, and c and d are reciprocals, find the value of the algebraic expression 2c-a-frac{2}{d}-b.","answer":"First, I recognize that ( a ) and ( b ) are opposite numbers, which means ( b = -a ).Next, since ( c ) and ( d ) are reciprocals, it follows that ( d = frac{1}{c} ).Now, I'll substitute these relationships into the expression ( 2c - a - frac{2}{d} - b ).Replacing ( b ) with ( -a ) and ( d ) with ( frac{1}{c} ), the expression becomes:[2c - a - frac{2}{frac{1}{c}} - (-a)]Simplifying further:[2c - a - 2c + a]Finally, combining like terms results in:[0]"},{"question":"What is half of the number ( 2^{12}+3 times 2^{10} ) ?

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm not too sure about modular arithmetic, but I remember something about remainders when dividing by numbers. Maybe I can use that here.First, I need to understand what it means for 3 to divide ( 2^n + 1 ). That means when I divide ( 2^n + 1 ) by 3, there should be no remainder. In other words, ( 2^n + 1 ) should be congruent to 0 modulo 3. So, mathematically, that would be:[ 2^n + 1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ]Which simplifies to:[ 2^n equiv -1 pmod{3} ]But since we're working modulo 3, -1 is the same as 2. So, I can rewrite that as:[ 2^n equiv 2 pmod{3} ]Okay, so I need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( 2^n ) leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. Maybe I can compute ( 2^n ) modulo 3 for different values of ( n ) and see if there's a pattern.Let me start calculating:- For ( n = 1 ): ( 2^1 = 2 ). ( 2 mod 3 = 2 ). So, that's good.- For ( n = 2 ): ( 2^2 = 4 ). ( 4 mod 3 = 1 ). Hmm, not 2.- For ( n = 3 ): ( 2^3 = 8 ). ( 8 mod 3 = 2 ). Okay, that works.- For ( n = 4 ): ( 2^4 = 16 ). ( 16 mod 3 = 1 ). Not 2.- For ( n = 5 ): ( 2^5 = 32 ). ( 32 mod 3 = 2 ). Good again.- For ( n = 6 ): ( 2^6 = 64 ). ( 64 mod 3 = 1 ). Not 2.Wait a second, I see a pattern here. It seems like when ( n ) is odd, ( 2^n mod 3 = 2 ), and when ( n ) is even, ( 2^n mod 3 = 1 ). Let me test this with a few more numbers to be sure.- ( n = 7 ): ( 2^7 = 128 ). ( 128 mod 3 = 2 ). Yep, odd exponent gives 2.- ( n = 8 ): ( 2^8 = 256 ). ( 256 mod 3 = 1 ). Even exponent gives 1.So, it looks like the pattern holds. Therefore, ( 2^n equiv 2 pmod{3} ) when ( n ) is odd, and ( 2^n equiv 1 pmod{3} ) when ( n ) is even. Since we want ( 2^n equiv 2 pmod{3} ), that happens exactly when ( n ) is odd. Therefore, 3 divides ( 2^n + 1 ) if and only if ( n ) is an odd positive integer.But just to make sure I'm not missing something, let me think about why this pattern occurs. Maybe it's related to the properties of exponents modulo 3.I know that Euler's theorem says that if ( a ) and ( m ) are coprime, then ( a^{phi(m)} equiv 1 pmod{m} ), where ( phi ) is Euler's totient function. Here, ( a = 2 ) and ( m = 3 ). Since 2 and 3 are coprime, Euler's theorem applies.Calculating ( phi(3) ): since 3 is prime, ( phi(3) = 3 - 1 = 2 ). So, Euler's theorem tells us that ( 2^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ). That's consistent with what I saw earlier: ( 2^2 = 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} ).Therefore, the powers of 2 modulo 3 cycle every 2 exponents. Let's write out the cycle:- ( 2^1 equiv 2 pmod{3} )- ( 2^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} )- ( 2^3 equiv 2 times 2^2 equiv 2 times 1 equiv 2 pmod{3} )- ( 2^4 equiv 2 times 2^3 equiv 2 times 2 equiv 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} )- And so on.So, the cycle is 2, 1, 2, 1, etc., repeating every 2 terms. Thus, the exponent ( n ) determines where we are in the cycle. If ( n ) is odd, we're at the first term of the cycle, which is 2. If ( n ) is even, we're at the second term, which is 1.Therefore, ( 2^n equiv 2 pmod{3} ) if and only if ( n ) is odd. Hence, ( 2^n + 1 equiv 2 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{3} ) when ( n ) is odd.Just to double-check, let me take ( n = 5 ): ( 2^5 + 1 = 32 + 1 = 33 ). 33 divided by 3 is 11, so yes, 3 divides 33. Similarly, ( n = 3 ): ( 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 ), which is divisible by 3. On the other hand, ( n = 2 ): ( 2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 ), which is not divisible by 3. That matches my conclusion.So, putting it all together, the positive integers ( n ) for which 3 divides ( 2^n + 1 ) are exactly the odd positive integers.**Final Answer**The positive integers ( n ) are all odd numbers, so the solution is boxed{n text{ is odd}}.Alternatively, if the answer needs to be in a specific format, perhaps using mathematical notation, it could be expressed as ( n equiv 1 pmod{2} ), but since the question asks for positive integers ( n ), stating that ( n ) is odd is sufficient.**Final Answer**boxed{n text{ is odd}}Alternatively, if the problem expects a more formal answer in terms of congruence, it could be:boxed{n equiv 1 pmod{2}}But since the question is about positive integers, specifying that ( n ) is odd is clear and concise.**Final Answer**boxed{n text{ is odd}}"},{"question":"Simplify first and then evaluate: (1+frac{1}{x+1})÷frac{x+2}{x^2-1}, where x=2.","answer":"First, I need to simplify the expression ((1 + frac{1}{x+1}) div frac{x+2}{x^2 - 1}).I'll start by simplifying the numerator (1 + frac{1}{x+1}).

This gives me (frac{x+1}{x+1} + frac{1}{x+1} = frac{x+2}{x+1}).Next, I'll rewrite the division as multiplication by the reciprocal of the denominator: (frac{x+2}{x+1} times frac{x^2 - 1}{x+2}).I notice that (x^2 - 1) is a difference of squares, so it factors into ((x+1)(x-1)). This allows me to cancel out the (x+2) and (x+1) terms, simplifying the expression to (x - 1).Finally, I'll substitute (x = 2) into the simplified expression: (2 - 1 = 1)."},{"question":"Given a natural number ( x = 8^n - 1 ), where ( n ) is a natural number. It is known that ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 31. Find ( x ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Given a natural number ( x = 8^n - 1 ), where ( n ) is a natural number. It's known that ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 31. I need to find ( x ).Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, ( x ) is defined as ( 8^n - 1 ). Since 8 is ( 2^3 ), I can rewrite ( x ) as ( (2^3)^n - 1 = 2^{3n} - 1 ). So, ( x = 2^{3n} - 1 ). That might be useful later.It's given that ( x ) has exactly three distinct prime divisors, and one of them is 31. So, 31 divides ( x ), which means ( 2^{3n} equiv 1 mod 31 ). I remember that for a prime ( p ), the multiplicative order of 2 modulo ( p ) is the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that ( 2^k equiv 1 mod p ). So, the order of 2 modulo 31 must divide ( 3n ).Let me find the order of 2 modulo 31. To do that, I can factorize ( 31 - 1 = 30 ) because the order must divide 30. The prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5. So, possible orders are the divisors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.Let's test these:- ( 2^1 = 2 mod 31 neq 1 )- ( 2^2 = 4 mod 31 neq 1 )- ( 2^3 = 8 mod 31 neq 1 )- ( 2^5 = 32 mod 31 = 1 mod 31 ). Wait, is that right? 32 divided by 31 is 1 with a remainder of 1. So, ( 2^5 equiv 1 mod 31 ).Oh, so the order of 2 modulo 31 is 5. That means that ( 5 ) divides ( 3n ). Therefore, ( 5 ) divides ( 3n ), which implies that ( 5 ) divides ( n ) because 5 and 3 are coprime. So, ( n ) must be a multiple of 5. Let me write that as ( n = 5k ) where ( k ) is a natural number.So, substituting back, ( x = 8^{5k} - 1 = (8^5)^k - 1 ). Let me compute ( 8^5 ):( 8^1 = 8 )( 8^2 = 64 )( 8^3 = 512 )( 8^4 = 4096 )( 8^5 = 32768 )So, ( x = 32768^k - 1 ). Hmm, that seems like a huge number, but maybe we can factor it.Wait, ( x = 8^{5k} - 1 ) can be factored as a difference of powers. Remember that ( a^m - 1 = (a - 1)(a^{m-1} + a^{m-2} + dots + a + 1) ). So, ( x = (8^5 - 1)(8^{5(k-1)} + 8^{5(k-2)} + dots + 8^5 + 1) ).Compute ( 8^5 - 1 ): 32768 - 1 = 32767. Hmm, 32767. I think that's a known prime? Wait, no, 32767 is 7 * 31 * 151. Let me check:32767 divided by 7: 32767 / 7 = 4681. So, 7 is a factor.4681 divided by 31: 4681 / 31 = 151. So, yes, 32767 = 7 * 31 * 151. So, that's three prime factors.So, ( x = (7 * 31 * 151) * (8^{5(k-1)} + 8^{5(k-2)} + dots + 8^5 + 1) ). Now, since ( x ) is supposed to have exactly three distinct prime divisors, and we already have 7, 31, and 151 from the first factor, the second factor must not introduce any new prime factors. That is, the second factor must be a power of one of these primes or 1.But the second factor is ( S = 8^{5(k-1)} + 8^{5(k-2)} + dots + 8^5 + 1 ). Let me compute this for k=1: then S = 1, so x = 32767, which is 7*31*151, exactly three primes. So, x=32767 is a candidate.But wait, is k=1 the only possibility? Let's check for k=2: Then, x = 8^{10} - 1. Let's compute 8^{10} = (8^5)^2 = 32768^2. 32768 squared is 1073741824. So, x = 1073741824 - 1 = 1073741823.Now, factorizing 1073741823. Let's see, we know that 1073741823 = (8^{10} - 1) = (8^5 - 1)(8^5 + 1) = 32767 * 32769.We already know 32767 is 7*31*151. Now, 32769: Let's check if it's divisible by 3: 3+2+7+6+9=27, which is divisible by 3, so yes. 32769 / 3 = 10923. 10923: sum of digits is 1+0+9+2+3=15, divisible by 3. 10923 / 3 = 3641.Is 3641 a prime? Let's check divisibility: 3641 divided by 11: 3641 / 11 = 331, which is exact? 11*331=3641. Wait, 11*300=3300, 11*31=341, so 3300+341=3641. Yes, so 3641=11*331. So, 32769=3*3*11*331. Therefore, 1073741823=7*31*151*3*3*11*331. So, that's more than three prime factors. So, x=1073741823 has more than three prime factors, which violates the condition. So, k=2 is invalid.Similarly, for k=3, x=8^{15}-1, which would be even larger, and likely have more prime factors. So, probably k=1 is the only solution.Wait, but let me check k=1: x=32767=7*31*151, exactly three prime factors, which satisfies the condition. So, is x=32767 the answer?But hold on, let me think again. The problem says that x has exactly three distinct prime divisors, one of which is 31. So, 31 is one, and the other two are 7 and 151. So, x=32767 is the number.But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other possible n's. For example, if n is a multiple of 5, like n=5,10,15,... We saw that n=5 gives x=32767, which works. n=10 gives x=1073741823, which has more prime factors. What about n=15? That would be 8^{15}-1, which is (8^5)^3 -1, which factors as (8^5 -1)(8^{10} + 8^5 +1). We already saw that 8^5 -1=32767=7*31*151, and 8^{10} +8^5 +1=1073741824 +32768 +1=1073774593. Is this prime? Probably not, but it's a huge number. Let me check divisibility by small primes.Divide by 3: sum of digits: 1+0+7+3+7+7+4+5+9+3= 46, which is not divisible by 3. Divide by 5: last digit is 3, so no. 7? Let me try 1073774593 /7: 7*153396370=1073774590, remainder 3. Not divisible by 7. 11: Alternating sum: (1+7+7+5+3) - (0+3+7+4+9)= (23) - (23)=0. So, divisible by 11. Therefore, 1073774593 is divisible by 11. So, 1073774593=11*something. So, x=8^{15}-1 would have at least four prime factors: 7,31,151,11, and possibly more. So, that's more than three, which is invalid.Similarly, n=5k with k>1 gives x with more than three prime factors. So, only k=1, n=5 gives x=32767, which has exactly three prime factors:7,31,151.Wait, but hold on. Is 151 a prime? Let me confirm. 151: It's not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11. 11*13=143, 11*14=154>151. So, yes, 151 is prime.So, x=32767 is the number. Therefore, the answer is 32767.But just to make sure, let me check n=5: 8^5=32768, so 32768-1=32767. Yes, that's correct.Is there any other n where x=8^n -1 has exactly three prime factors, one of which is 31? For example, maybe n= something else, not multiple of 5? Wait, earlier I concluded that n must be multiple of 5 because the order of 2 modulo 31 is 5, so 5 divides 3n, hence 5 divides n. So, n must be multiple of 5.Therefore, n=5 is the smallest, and n=10,15,... give larger x with more prime factors. So, n=5 is the only possible n that gives x with exactly three prime factors, one of which is 31.Therefore, x=32767.**Final Answer**The value of ( x ) is boxed{32767}."},{"question":"Brianna is using part of the money she earned on her weekend job to buy several equally-priced CDs.

If one third of the CDs cost one fifth of her money, then the entire set of CDs would cost three times that amount. Calculating this, three times one fifth is three fifths. Therefore, all the CDs together will cost three fifths of her money.Finally, to find the fraction of money she will have left, I subtract the cost of the CDs from her total money.

He has an unlimited supply of 2, 5, and 10 dollar notes. In how many ways can he pay?","answer":"Okay, so John needs to pay 2010 for his dinner, and he can use any combination of 2, 5, and 10 notes. He has an unlimited supply of each, so the question is asking how many different ways he can make up 2010 using these denominations. Hmm, this seems like a classic combinatorics problem, specifically a coin change problem but with notes instead of coins. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that for problems like this, it's often useful to break it down into smaller subproblems or use some sort of recursive relation. But since the numbers here are pretty large (2010 is a big number), recursion might not be the most efficient way. Maybe a dynamic programming approach would be better, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can model this algebraically.Let me denote the number of 2 notes as x, the number of 5 notes as y, and the number of 10 notes as z. Then, the total amount would be 2x + 5y + 10z = 2010. So, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions (x, y, z) to this equation.Hmm, that seems manageable. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to 2x + 5y + 10z = 2010. I think I can simplify this equation by dividing through by 2, since all the coefficients are even except for 5, but wait, 5 is not even. Hmm, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can fix one variable and express the others in terms of it.Let me try to fix z, the number of 10 notes. Since each 10 note contributes 10, the maximum number of 10 notes John can use is 2010 / 10 = 201. So, z can range from 0 to 201.For each fixed z, the equation becomes 2x + 5y = 2010 - 10z. Let me denote this as 2x + 5y = N, where N = 2010 - 10z. So, for each z, I need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions (x, y) to 2x + 5y = N.Now, this is a simpler equation with two variables. Let me see how to solve this. I can express x in terms of y: x = (N - 5y)/2. Since x must be a non-negative integer, (N - 5y) must be even and non-negative.So, N - 5y must be even. Since N is 2010 - 10z, which is 10*(201 - z). So, N is a multiple of 10, which is also a multiple of 2 and 5. Therefore, N is even, so 5y must also be even because N - 5y is even. Since 5 is odd, y must be even for 5y to be even. So, y must be even.Let me denote y = 2k, where k is a non-negative integer. Then, substituting back into x = (N - 5y)/2, we get x = (N - 10k)/2 = N/2 - 5k.Since x must be non-negative, N/2 - 5k >= 0. So, 5k <= N/2, which implies k <= N/(10). Since N = 10*(201 - z), N/10 = 201 - z. Therefore, k <= 201 - z.Also, since y = 2k must be non-negative, k must be >= 0. So, k ranges from 0 to 201 - z.Therefore, for each fixed z, the number of solutions (x, y) is equal to the number of possible k's, which is (201 - z + 1). Wait, is that right? Because k can take integer values from 0 up to (201 - z), inclusive. So, the number of solutions is (201 - z + 1) = 202 - z.Wait, let me check that. If z is fixed, then N = 10*(201 - z). Then, y must be even, so y = 0, 2, 4, ..., up to some maximum y_max. Let's find y_max.From 2x + 5y = N, since x must be non-negative, 5y <= N. So, y <= N/5 = 2*(201 - z). Since y must be even, the maximum y is 2*(201 - z). Therefore, y can take values 0, 2, 4, ..., 2*(201 - z). The number of terms in this sequence is (2*(201 - z))/2 + 1 = (201 - z) + 1 = 202 - z. So, yes, that's correct.Therefore, for each z, the number of solutions is 202 - z. So, to find the total number of ways, we need to sum this over all possible z from 0 to 201.So, the total number of ways is the sum from z = 0 to z = 201 of (202 - z).Let me compute this sum. The sum is equal to sum_{z=0}^{201} (202 - z). Let's make a substitution: let k = z. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=0}^{201} (202 - k) = sum_{k=0}^{201} 202 - sum_{k=0}^{201} k.Compute each part separately:sum_{k=0}^{201} 202 = 202 * (201 + 1) = 202 * 202.sum_{k=0}^{201} k = (201 * 202)/2.So, total sum = 202^2 - (201 * 202)/2.Let me compute 202^2 first. 202 * 202. Let's compute 200^2 + 2*200*2 + 2^2 = 40000 + 800 + 4 = 40804. Wait, no, that's (200 + 2)^2. Alternatively, 202*202: 200*200 = 40000, 200*2 = 400, 2*200 = 400, 2*2=4. So, 40000 + 400 + 400 + 4 = 40804. So, 202^2 = 40804.Now, compute (201 * 202)/2. Let's compute 201*202 first. 200*202 = 40,400. 1*202 = 202. So, total is 40,400 + 202 = 40,602. Then, divide by 2: 40,602 / 2 = 20,301.So, total sum = 40,804 - 20,301 = 20,503.Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations.Wait, 202^2 is 40,804. Correct.201*202: Let's compute 201*200 + 201*2 = 40,200 + 402 = 40,602. Then, divided by 2 is 20,301. Correct.So, 40,804 - 20,301 = 20,503. Hmm, okay.But wait, let me think again. The total number of ways is 20,503? That seems plausible, but let me verify my reasoning.We have for each z from 0 to 201, the number of solutions is 202 - z. So, when z=0, the number of solutions is 202. When z=1, it's 201, and so on until z=201, which gives 1 solution. So, the total number of solutions is the sum from k=1 to 202 of k, but wait, no. Wait, when z=0, it's 202 solutions, which is k=202, and when z=201, it's 1 solution, which is k=1. So, actually, it's the sum from k=1 to 202 of k, but in reverse. Wait, no, because when z increases, the number of solutions decreases.Wait, actually, the sum is 202 + 201 + 200 + ... + 1. Which is the same as the sum from 1 to 202. The formula for the sum from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. So, sum from 1 to 202 is 202*203/2. Let me compute that.202*203: Let's compute 200*203 + 2*203 = 40,600 + 406 = 41,006. Then, divide by 2: 41,006 / 2 = 20,503. So, that's consistent with my earlier result.Therefore, the total number of ways is 20,503.Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Is this correct? Because when I fixed z, I considered y being even, and then expressed y as 2k, leading to x = (N - 10k)/2. But does this cover all possible solutions?Wait, another way to think about it is that for each z, the equation 2x + 5y = N has solutions where y must be even because 2x must be even, and N is even (since N = 10*(201 - z)). So, 5y must also be even, which implies y must be even because 5 is odd. So, y must be even, which is why we set y = 2k. So, that seems correct.Therefore, for each z, the number of solutions is indeed 202 - z, and summing that from z=0 to z=201 gives 20,503. So, that should be the answer.But just to be thorough, let me test this with a smaller amount to see if the logic holds.Suppose John needs to pay 10. Then, using the same method:Total amount N = 10.z can be 0, 1.For z=0: 2x + 5y = 10.y must be even: y=0,2.- y=0: x=5- y=2: x=0So, 2 solutions.For z=1: 2x + 5y = 0.Only solution: x=0, y=0.So, 1 solution.Total solutions: 2 + 1 = 3.Alternatively, using the formula: sum from z=0 to z=1 of (2 - z). Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this case, N = 10, so 2010 is replaced by 10, so z_max = 10/10 = 1.So, for each z, the number of solutions is (10/10 - z + 1) = (1 - z +1) = 2 - z.Wait, but when z=0: 2 solutions, z=1:1 solution. So, the sum is 2 +1=3, which is correct.Alternatively, using the formula: sum from z=0 to z=1 of (2 - z) = 2 +1=3.But according to the previous method, 202 - z would be incorrect because in this case, the number of solutions per z is (N/10 - z +1). Wait, in the original problem, N = 2010 -10z, so N/10 = 201 - z, so the number of solutions per z is (201 - z +1) = 202 - z. But in the smaller case, N =10 -10z, so N/10 =1 - z, so the number of solutions per z is (1 - z +1)=2 - z. So, yes, that's consistent.So, in the small case, the total number of solutions is sum_{z=0}^{1} (2 - z) = 2 +1=3, which is correct.Another test case: let's say John needs to pay 20.z can be 0,1,2.For z=0: 2x +5y=20.y must be even: y=0,2,4.- y=0: x=10- y=2: x=5- y=4: x=0So, 3 solutions.For z=1: 2x +5y=10.y=0,2.- y=0: x=5- y=2: x=0So, 2 solutions.For z=2: 2x +5y=0.Only solution: x=0, y=0.So, 1 solution.Total solutions: 3 +2 +1=6.Using the formula: sum_{z=0}^{2} (202 - z). Wait, no, in this case, N=20, so z_max=2.Wait, in the original problem, N=2010, so z_max=201. In the test case, N=20, so z_max=2.So, for each z, the number of solutions is (20/10 - z +1)= (2 - z +1)=3 - z.Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the original problem, N=2010 -10z, so N/10=201 - z. So, the number of solutions per z is (201 - z +1)=202 - z.In the test case, N=20 -10z, so N/10=2 - z. So, the number of solutions per z is (2 - z +1)=3 - z.So, for z=0:3 solutions, z=1:2 solutions, z=2:1 solution. Sum=6, which matches the manual count.Therefore, the formula seems to hold.So, going back to the original problem, the total number of ways is 20,503.Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to model this problem? Maybe using generating functions?Yes, generating functions can be used for such problems. The generating function for the number of ways to make change with 2,5,10 notes is:G(x) = 1 / [(1 - x^2)(1 - x^5)(1 - x^10)]But computing the coefficient of x^2010 in this generating function is non-trivial without a computer algebra system. However, since we've already derived the answer through combinatorial reasoning, and the test cases check out, I think 20,503 is correct.Alternatively, another way to think about it is to fix the number of 10 notes first, then for each of those, fix the number of 5 notes, and then the number of 2 notes is determined. But that's essentially what we did earlier.Wait, but let me try to see if I can express it differently. Let's consider that after using some number of 10 notes, the remaining amount is a multiple of 5 or 2. Hmm, but since 2 and 5 are coprime, the number of ways to make up the remaining amount with 2s and 5s can be determined.But in our earlier approach, we already accounted for that by setting y as even, which simplified the equation. So, I think our initial approach is solid.Therefore, I'm confident that the total number of ways is 20,503.**Final Answer**The number of ways John can pay is boxed{20503}."},{"question":"A circle passes through the point (0,1), and is tangent to the parabola y = x^2 at (2,4).

I need to find the center of the circle. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the general equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. Since the circle passes through (0,1), plugging that into the equation should satisfy it. So, substituting x=0 and y=1, I get:(0 - h)² + (1 - k)² = r²Which simplifies to:h² + (1 - k)² = r²  ...(1)Also, the circle is tangent to the parabola at (2,4). That means two things: first, the point (2,4) lies on the circle, so plugging that into the circle equation should also satisfy it. Second, the tangent to the parabola at (2,4) is the same as the tangent to the circle at that point. So, the slopes of these tangents must be equal.Let me write down the equation of the circle again:(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²Since (2,4) is on the circle, substituting x=2 and y=4:(2 - h)² + (4 - k)² = r²  ...(2)So now I have two equations: equation (1) and equation (2). Both equal to r², so I can set them equal to each other:h² + (1 - k)² = (2 - h)² + (4 - k)²Let me expand both sides:Left side: h² + (1 - 2k + k²)Right side: (4 - 4h + h²) + (16 - 8k + k²)So, expanding:Left: h² + 1 - 2k + k²Right: 4 - 4h + h² + 16 - 8k + k²Simplify both sides:Left: h² + k² - 2k + 1Right: (4 + 16) + (-4h) + (h² + k²) + (-8k)Which is: 20 - 4h + h² + k² - 8kSo, setting left equal to right:h² + k² - 2k + 1 = 20 - 4h + h² + k² - 8kHmm, let's subtract h² and k² from both sides:-2k + 1 = 20 - 4h -8kNow, let's bring all terms to one side:-2k + 1 -20 + 4h +8k = 0Simplify:( -2k +8k ) + (1 -20) +4h = 06k -19 +4h =0So, 4h +6k =19  ...(3)Okay, so that's one equation relating h and k. Now, I need another equation, which comes from the fact that the circle is tangent to the parabola at (2,4). So, the slopes of the tangents must be equal.First, let's find the derivative of the parabola y = x² at (2,4). The derivative dy/dx = 2x, so at x=2, the slope is 4. Therefore, the tangent line to the parabola at (2,4) has a slope of 4.Now, the tangent to the circle at (2,4) must also have a slope of 4. The slope of the tangent to the circle at a point is equal to the negative reciprocal of the radius at that point. Wait, actually, the slope of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of the circle at that point, which can be found using implicit differentiation.Alternatively, I remember that the tangent line at (x1,y1) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 is given by:(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r²Wait, no, actually, the equation of the tangent line at (x1,y1) is:(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r²Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall. The tangent line equation for a circle is:(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r²But actually, I think that's the equation of the tangent line. Let me verify.Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the derivative. Let's do that.Given the circle equation: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2Differentiate both sides with respect to x:2(x - h) + 2(y - k)(dy/dx) = 0So, solving for dy/dx:dy/dx = -(x - h)/(y - k)So, at the point (2,4), the slope of the tangent line is:m = -(2 - h)/(4 - k)But we know this slope must be equal to 4, the slope of the parabola's tangent at that point.So:-(2 - h)/(4 - k) = 4Multiply both sides by (4 - k):-(2 - h) = 4(4 - k)Simplify:-2 + h = 16 -4kBring all terms to one side:h +4k = 16 +2h +4k =18  ...(4)So now, I have two equations:From equation (3): 4h +6k =19From equation (4): h +4k =18Now, I can solve this system of equations.Let me write them:4h +6k =19  ...(3)h +4k =18    ...(4)Let me solve equation (4) for h:h =18 -4kNow, substitute into equation (3):4*(18 -4k) +6k =19Compute:72 -16k +6k =19Simplify:72 -10k =19Subtract 72:-10k =19 -72-10k = -53Divide:k = (-53)/(-10) =53/10 =5.3So, k =53/10Now, substitute back into equation (4):h +4*(53/10)=18Compute 4*(53/10)=212/10=21.2=106/5So:h +106/5 =18Convert 18 to fifths: 18=90/5So:h =90/5 -106/5= (90 -106)/5= (-16)/5= -16/5= -3.2So, h= -16/5Therefore, the center of the circle is at (h,k)= (-16/5,53/10)Wait, let me just verify that.So, h=-16/5, k=53/10.Let me check equation (3):4h +6k=4*(-16/5)+6*(53/10)= (-64/5) + (318/10)= (-64/5)+(159/5)= ( -64 +159 )/5=95/5=19, which matches equation (3). Good.Equation (4): h +4k= (-16/5)+4*(53/10)= (-16/5)+(212/10)= (-16/5)+(106/5)= ( -16 +106 )/5=90/5=18, which matches equation (4). Good.So, that seems consistent.Now, just to be thorough, let's check if the circle passes through (0,1) and is tangent at (2,4).First, compute r² from equation (1):r²= h² + (1 -k)^2h= -16/5, so h²= (256)/25k=53/10, so 1 -k=1 -53/10= (10/10 -53/10)= (-43/10), so (1 -k)^2= (1849)/100Thus, r²=256/25 +1849/100= (256*4)/100 +1849/100= (1024 +1849)/100=2873/100=28.73Alternatively, from equation (2):(2 - h)^2 + (4 -k)^22 - h=2 - (-16/5)=2 +16/5= (10/5 +16/5)=26/5, so squared is 676/254 -k=4 -53/10= (40/10 -53/10)= (-13/10), squared is 169/100So, r²=676/25 +169/100= (676*4)/100 +169/100= (2704 +169)/100=2873/100, same as before. So, consistent.Now, let's check the slope condition.The slope of the tangent to the circle at (2,4) is -(2 - h)/(4 -k)= -(2 - (-16/5))/(4 -53/10)= -(2 +16/5)/(4 -5.3)Compute numerator: 2 +16/5= (10/5 +16/5)=26/5Denominator:4 -5.3= -1.3= -13/10So, slope= -(26/5)/(-13/10)= -(26/5)*( -10/13)= (26*10)/(5*13)= (260)/(65)=4, which is correct.So, that's consistent with the slope of the parabola's tangent.Therefore, the center is at (-16/5,53/10). So, in boxed form, that would be boxed{left( -dfrac{16}{5}, dfrac{53}{10} right)}.**Final Answer**The center of the circle is boxed{left( -dfrac{16}{5}, dfrac{53}{10} right)}."},{"question":"On the board is written the number 98. Every minute the number is erased and replaced with the product of its digits increased by 15. What number will be on the board in an hour?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where the number 98 is written on a board. Every minute, the number is erased and replaced with the product of its digits increased by 15. I need to figure out what number will be on the board after an hour, which is 60 minutes. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.First, let me understand the process. Starting with 98, each minute I replace it with the product of its digits plus 15. So, for the first minute, I take 9 and 8, multiply them, and then add 15. Let me calculate that:9 * 8 = 7272 + 15 = 87So, after the first minute, the number becomes 87. Got it. Now, I need to repeat this process for each subsequent minute. Let me try the next few steps to see if I can spot a pattern or something.Starting with 87:8 * 7 = 5656 + 15 = 71So, after the second minute, it's 71. Okay, moving on.Starting with 71:7 * 1 = 77 + 15 = 22Third minute, it becomes 22. Hmm, interesting. Let's continue.Starting with 22:2 * 2 = 44 + 15 = 19Fourth minute, 19. Alright.Starting with 19:1 * 9 = 99 + 15 = 24Fifth minute, 24.Starting with 24:2 * 4 = 88 + 15 = 23Sixth minute, 23.Starting with 23:2 * 3 = 66 + 15 = 21Seventh minute, 21.Starting with 21:2 * 1 = 22 + 15 = 17Eighth minute, 17.Starting with 17:1 * 7 = 77 + 15 = 22Wait a second, that's 22 again. Hmm, so now we're back to 22. Let me write down the sequence so far to see if there's a cycle:98 → 87 → 71 → 22 → 19 → 24 → 23 → 21 → 17 → 22 → ...Yes, so after 8 minutes, we reach 22, and then it cycles back to 19, 24, 23, 21, 17, and then back to 22. So, from 22 onwards, it's a cycle of 6 numbers: 22, 19, 24, 23, 21, 17, and then back to 22. So, the cycle length is 6.Let me confirm that. Starting from 22:22 → 19 (minute 4)19 → 24 (minute 5)24 → 23 (minute 6)23 → 21 (minute 7)21 → 17 (minute 8)17 → 22 (minute 9)Yep, so from minute 4 to minute 9, it cycles back to 22, which was at minute 4. So, the cycle is 6 numbers long.So, starting from minute 4, every 6 minutes, it repeats. So, if I can figure out how many minutes are left after the initial 8 minutes, I can determine where we are in the cycle.Wait, hold on. Let me recount the steps:Minute 0: 98Minute 1: 87Minute 2: 71Minute 3: 22Minute 4: 19Minute 5: 24Minute 6: 23Minute 7: 21Minute 8: 17Minute 9: 22Minute 10: 19... and so on.So, starting from minute 3, the number is 22, and then it cycles every 6 minutes. So, from minute 3 onwards, the cycle is 22, 19, 24, 23, 21, 17, and back to 22.So, the cycle starts at minute 3, and each cycle is 6 minutes. So, to find the number after 60 minutes, I need to see how many minutes are after the cycle starts and then find the position in the cycle.Wait, minute 0 is the starting point, 98. Then minute 1 is 87, minute 2 is 71, minute 3 is 22, which is the start of the cycle. So, from minute 3 to minute 8, that's 6 minutes, and it cycles back to 22 at minute 9.So, the cycle length is 6, starting at minute 3.So, total minutes: 60.Minutes before the cycle starts: 3 minutes (minutes 0,1,2). So, minutes 3 to 60 is 57 minutes.But wait, minute 3 is the first minute of the cycle. So, from minute 3 to minute 60 is 57 minutes. Since the cycle is 6 minutes, I can divide 57 by 6 to see how many full cycles and the remainder.57 divided by 6 is 9 with a remainder of 3. So, 9 full cycles (54 minutes) and 3 extra minutes.So, starting from minute 3, after 54 minutes (which is 9 cycles), we'll be back at 22. Then, we need to go 3 more minutes into the cycle.So, minute 3: 22Minute 4: 19Minute 5: 24Minute 6: 23So, 3 minutes after minute 3 would be minute 6, which is 23.Wait, but hold on, let me double-check:Starting at minute 3: 22Minute 4: 19 (1st minute of cycle)Minute 5: 24 (2nd)Minute 6: 23 (3rd)Minute 7: 21 (4th)Minute 8: 17 (5th)Minute 9: 22 (6th, back to start)So, each cycle is 6 minutes, starting at minute 3.So, after 57 minutes from minute 3, which is 9 cycles (54 minutes) plus 3 minutes.So, starting at minute 3 (22), after 54 minutes, we are back at 22. Then, 3 more minutes:Minute 3 + 54 = minute 57: 22Minute 58: 19Minute 59: 24Minute 60: 23Wait, hold on. Wait, if minute 3 is the start, then minute 3 + 57 minutes would be minute 60.But let's think differently. Maybe I should model it as:Total minutes: 60First 3 minutes: 98 → 87 → 71 → 22Then, from minute 3 to minute 60: 57 minutes.Since the cycle is 6 minutes, 57 divided by 6 is 9 with remainder 3.So, 9 full cycles (54 minutes) bring us back to 22 at minute 57.Then, 3 more minutes:Minute 57: 22Minute 58: 19Minute 59: 24Minute 60: 23So, the number at minute 60 is 23.Wait, but let me confirm this step by step.Starting from minute 0: 98Minute 1: 87Minute 2: 71Minute 3: 22Minute 4: 19Minute 5: 24Minute 6: 23Minute 7: 21Minute 8: 17Minute 9: 22Minute 10: 19Minute 11: 24Minute 12: 23Minute 13: 21Minute 14: 17Minute 15: 22... and so on.So, every 6 minutes starting from minute 3, it cycles through 22,19,24,23,21,17.So, to find minute 60, let's see how many minutes after minute 3 it is: 60 - 3 = 57 minutes.57 divided by 6 is 9 with remainder 3.So, 9 full cycles (54 minutes) bring us back to 22 at minute 57.Then, 3 more minutes:Minute 57: 22Minute 58: 19Minute 59: 24Minute 60: 23So, yes, the number at minute 60 is 23.Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly.Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as:From minute 3 onwards, each 6 minutes, it cycles.So, the number at minute 3 + 6k is 22, where k is an integer.So, minute 3: 22Minute 9: 22Minute 15: 22...So, minute 3 + 6k: 22So, to find minute 60, how much is 60 - 3 = 57.57 divided by 6 is 9 with remainder 3.So, 57 = 6*9 + 3.So, starting from minute 3, after 9 full cycles (54 minutes), we are at minute 57: 22.Then, 3 more minutes:Minute 57: 22Minute 58: 19Minute 59: 24Minute 60: 23So, yes, 23 is the number at minute 60.Wait, but let me check the cycle again.Cycle is: 22 →19→24→23→21→17→22...So, starting at 22, the next numbers are 19,24,23,21,17, then back to 22.So, each cycle is 6 numbers, so each cycle is 6 minutes.So, starting at minute 3, each 6 minutes, it cycles.So, minute 3:22minute 4:19minute5:24minute6:23minute7:21minute8:17minute9:22So, yes, cycle is 6 minutes.So, from minute 3, every 6 minutes, it's 22.So, minute 3:22minute9:22minute15:22...So, minute 3 + 6k:22So, 60 -3 =5757 divided by6 is9, remainder3.So, 57=6*9 +3So, 9 full cycles (54 minutes) bring us to minute57:22Then, 3 more minutes:minute58:19minute59:24minute60:23So, yes, 23.Wait, but let me verify with a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire process step by step for 60 minutes, but that would be tedious. Instead, perhaps I can see if the cycle is indeed 6 minutes.From minute3:22minute4:19minute5:24minute6:23minute7:21minute8:17minute9:22Yes, so from minute3 to minute9 is 6 minutes, and it cycles back to22.So, the cycle is indeed 6 minutes.Therefore, after minute3, every 6 minutes, it cycles.So, total minutes after minute3:5757 divided by6 is9, remainder3.So, 9 full cycles, and then 3 more steps.So, starting from22, 3 steps:22→19→24→23So, minute60 is23.Therefore, the number on the board after an hour is23.Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the cycle.Wait, starting from22:22: product is2*2=4, plus15=1919:1*9=9, plus15=2424:2*4=8, plus15=2323:2*3=6, plus15=2121:2*1=2, plus15=1717:1*7=7, plus15=22Yes, so the cycle is indeed 22→19→24→23→21→17→22...So, 6 numbers, 6 minutes.Therefore, the calculation seems correct.So, the number after 60 minutes is23.**Final Answer**The number on the board after an hour will be boxed{23}."},{"question":"Given points P(a,3) and Q(4,b) are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, then left(a+bright)^{2021}=______.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Points P(a, 3) and Q(4, b) are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. I need to find (a + b)^2021. Hmm, okay. Let me think about what this means.First, symmetry with respect to the x-axis. I remember that if two points are symmetric about the x-axis, their x-coordinates are the same, and their y-coordinates are negatives of each other. So, for example, if I have a point (x, y), its reflection over the x-axis would be (x, -y). Is that right? Yeah, I think so.So, applying that to points P and Q. Point P is (a, 3), and point Q is (4, b). Since they're symmetric with respect to the x-axis, their x-coordinates should be equal, and their y-coordinates should be negatives. That means:1. The x-coordinate of P is a, and the x-coordinate of Q is 4. So, for them to be symmetric, a must equal 4. That seems straightforward.2. The y-coordinate of P is 3, and the y-coordinate of Q is b. Since they're symmetric over the x-axis, b should be the negative of 3. So, b = -3.Let me write that down:- a = 4- b = -3So, now I need to find (a + b)^2021. Substituting the values I found:a + b = 4 + (-3) = 1Therefore, (a + b)^2021 = 1^2021.Hmm, what's 1 raised to any power? Well, 1 multiplied by itself any number of times is still 1. So, 1^2021 is just 1.Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes, I mix up the axes or the signs.Symmetry with respect to the x-axis: reflection over x-axis changes the y-coordinate's sign. So, if P is (a, 3), then Q should be (a, -3). But in the problem, Q is given as (4, b). So, comparing, a must be 4, and b must be -3. Yep, that seems correct.So, adding them together: 4 + (-3) is 1. Raising 1 to any exponent is 1. So, (1)^2021 is 1.I don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems pretty straightforward. Maybe I can think of another way to approach it to confirm.Alternatively, if I recall, the midpoint between two symmetric points with respect to the x-axis should lie on the x-axis. The midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). So, the midpoint between P(a, 3) and Q(4, b) should be ((a + 4)/2, (3 + b)/2). Since it's on the x-axis, the y-coordinate must be 0. So:(3 + b)/2 = 0Multiplying both sides by 2:3 + b = 0So, b = -3. That's consistent with what I found earlier.Also, for the x-coordinate, since the points are symmetric over the x-axis, their x-coordinates must be the same. So, a must equal 4. Again, consistent.Therefore, a + b = 4 + (-3) = 1, and 1^2021 is 1. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.Just to recap:1. Understand that symmetry over x-axis implies same x-coordinate and y-coordinates are negatives.2. Set a = 4 and b = -3.3. Calculate a + b = 1.4. Compute 1^2021 = 1.5. Verified using midpoint method, same result.So, yeah, I think that's solid. I don't see any holes in this reasoning. It all checks out.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"Let ( a ) be ( 150% ) of ( b ).

The problem states that ( a ) is 150% of ( b ), which means ( a = 1.5b ).Next, I want to find out what percent ( 3b ) is of ( a ). To do this, I'll set up the equation ( 3b = frac{x}{100} times a ).Substituting ( a ) with ( 1.5b ) gives me ( 3b = frac{x}{100} times 1.5b ).Simplifying the equation by dividing both sides by ( b ) results in ( 3 = frac{x}{100} times 1.5 ).To solve for ( x ), I'll divide both sides by 1.5, leading to ( x = frac{3}{1.5} times 100 ).Calculating this gives ( x = 200 ).Therefore, ( 3b ) is 200% of ( a )."},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: ({frac{{x-2}}{x}-frac{x}{{x+2}}})÷frac{{x+2}}{{{x^2}+4x+4}}, where x=-1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this algebra problem to solve: simplify first, then evaluate the expression (left(frac{x-2}{x} - frac{x}{x+2}right) div frac{x+2}{x^2 + 4x + 4}) where (x = -1). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that when dealing with fractions, simplifying often involves finding a common denominator or factoring where possible. The expression has two parts: the numerator part, which is (frac{x-2}{x} - frac{x}{x+2}), and the denominator part, which is (frac{x+2}{x^2 + 4x + 4}). Since it's a division of two expressions, I can rewrite it as multiplying by the reciprocal. So, that would be (left(frac{x-2}{x} - frac{x}{x+2}right) times frac{x^2 + 4x + 4}{x+2}).Before I proceed, I should check if I can factor any parts of this expression to make it simpler. Looking at the denominator of the second fraction, (x^2 + 4x + 4), that looks familiar. I think that factors into ((x + 2)^2) because ((x + 2)(x + 2) = x^2 + 4x + 4). Let me confirm that: yes, that's correct.So, substituting that back in, the expression becomes (left(frac{x-2}{x} - frac{x}{x+2}right) times frac{(x + 2)^2}{x + 2}). Now, I can simplify (frac{(x + 2)^2}{x + 2}) by canceling one ((x + 2)) from the numerator and denominator, which leaves me with (x + 2). So now, the entire expression is (left(frac{x-2}{x} - frac{x}{x+2}right) times (x + 2)).Alright, so now I need to simplify the numerator part: (frac{x-2}{x} - frac{x}{x+2}). To subtract these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (x) and (x + 2), so the common denominator would be (x(x + 2)). Let me rewrite each fraction with this common denominator.For the first fraction, (frac{x - 2}{x}), I need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by (x + 2) to get the denominator to (x(x + 2)). That gives me (frac{(x - 2)(x + 2)}{x(x + 2)}).For the second fraction, (frac{x}{x + 2}), I need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by (x) to get the denominator to (x(x + 2)). That gives me (frac{x cdot x}{x(x + 2)} = frac{x^2}{x(x + 2)}).Now, subtracting these two, the expression becomes (frac{(x - 2)(x + 2) - x^2}{x(x + 2)}). Let me expand the numerator:First, ((x - 2)(x + 2)) is a difference of squares, so that's (x^2 - 4). So, substituting back in, the numerator is (x^2 - 4 - x^2). Simplifying that, the (x^2) terms cancel out, leaving (-4). So, the entire numerator part simplifies to (frac{-4}{x(x + 2)}).Putting it all together, the entire expression is now (frac{-4}{x(x + 2)} times (x + 2)). I can see that ((x + 2)) in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, as long as (x + 2 neq 0), which would mean (x neq -2). Since we're evaluating at (x = -1), which is not (-2), that's fine.So, after canceling, we're left with (frac{-4}{x}). Now, substituting (x = -1) into this simplified expression, we get (frac{-4}{-1}), which is equal to 4.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning:1. Original expression: (left(frac{x-2}{x} - frac{x}{x+2}right) div frac{x+2}{x^2 + 4x + 4}).2. Factored denominator of the divisor: (x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)^2).3. Rewrote division as multiplication by reciprocal: (left(frac{x-2}{x} - frac{x}{x+2}right) times frac{(x + 2)^2}{x + 2}).4. Simplified (frac{(x + 2)^2}{x + 2}) to (x + 2).5. Subtracted the two fractions in the numerator by finding a common denominator: (x(x + 2)).6. Expanded and simplified the numerator: ((x - 2)(x + 2) - x^2 = x^2 - 4 - x^2 = -4).7. So, the numerator part became (frac{-4}{x(x + 2)}).8. Multiplied by (x + 2), canceled out, resulting in (frac{-4}{x}).9. Substituted (x = -1): (frac{-4}{-1} = 4).Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in my calculations.

I need to find the minimum value of the expression 1/a + 1/b + 1/(ab). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I think I need to find the center of the circle. The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0, and its center is at (-D/2, -E/2). So, comparing this with the given circle equation, which is x² + y² - 4x + 2y + 1 = 0, I can see that D is -4 and E is 2. Therefore, the center should be at (-(-4)/2, -2/2), which simplifies to (2, -1). Let me double-check that: yes, because if you complete the squares, you would get (x - 2)² + (y + 1)² = something, so the center is indeed (2, -1). Got that.Now, the line ax - 2by = 2 passes through this center point (2, -1). So, I can substitute x = 2 and y = -1 into the equation of the line to find a relationship between a and b. Let's do that:a*(2) - 2b*(-1) = 2Simplifying that:2a + 2b = 2Hmm, okay, so 2a + 2b = 2. I can divide both sides by 2 to make it simpler:a + b = 1So, that's a key equation: a + b = 1, with a > 0 and b > 0. So, both a and b are positive numbers adding up to 1. Got it.Now, the expression I need to minimize is 1/a + 1/b + 1/(ab). Let me write that down:E = 1/a + 1/b + 1/(ab)Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of a and b, and then use the constraint a + b = 1 to reduce it to a single variable. Let me see.First, let's try to combine the terms:E = (1/a + 1/b) + 1/(ab)I know that 1/a + 1/b can be written as (b + a)/(ab). So, substituting that in:E = (a + b)/(ab) + 1/(ab)Since a + b is 1, from the earlier equation, this becomes:E = 1/(ab) + 1/(ab) = 2/(ab)Wait, that's interesting. So, the expression simplifies to 2/(ab). So, E = 2/(ab). Therefore, to minimize E, I need to maximize ab, because E is inversely proportional to ab.So, the problem reduces to maximizing ab given that a + b = 1 and a, b > 0.I remember from algebra that for two positive numbers with a fixed sum, their product is maximized when they are equal. So, if a + b = 1, then ab is maximized when a = b = 1/2. Let me verify that.Using the AM-GM inequality, which states that for positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So,(a + b)/2 ≥ √(ab)Since a + b = 1,1/2 ≥ √(ab)Squaring both sides,1/4 ≥ abSo, the maximum value of ab is 1/4, achieved when a = b = 1/2.Therefore, the maximum value of ab is 1/4, so the minimum value of E = 2/(ab) is 2/(1/4) = 8.Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, E = 2/(ab), and ab is at most 1/4, so 2/(1/4) is indeed 8. So, the minimum value of E is 8.But just to double-check, let's substitute a = b = 1/2 into the original expression:1/a + 1/b + 1/(ab) = 1/(1/2) + 1/(1/2) + 1/( (1/2)(1/2) ) = 2 + 2 + 1/(1/4) = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8. Yep, that checks out.But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that ab could be larger than 1/4? For example, if a is very close to 1 and b is very close to 0, ab would be close to 0, making E very large. Conversely, if a and b are both 1/2, ab is 1/4, which is the maximum possible product given a + b =1. So, yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can use calculus to confirm this. Let me set up the problem as an optimization problem with the constraint a + b =1.Let me express b in terms of a: b = 1 - a.Then, ab = a(1 - a) = a - a².To find the maximum of ab, take the derivative with respect to a:d(ab)/da = 1 - 2a.Set derivative equal to zero:1 - 2a = 0 => a = 1/2.So, at a = 1/2, ab is maximized. Then, b = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. So, same result.Therefore, ab_max = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.Hence, E_min = 2/(1/4) = 8.So, the minimum value of the expression is 8.Wait, just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by using substitution or another inequality.Alternatively, since E = 1/a + 1/b + 1/(ab), and a + b =1, maybe I can express everything in terms of a single variable.Let me try that. Since b = 1 - a, substitute into E:E = 1/a + 1/(1 - a) + 1/(a(1 - a)).Let me compute this:E = 1/a + 1/(1 - a) + 1/(a - a²).Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can combine the first two terms:1/a + 1/(1 - a) = (1 - a + a)/(a(1 - a)) = 1/(a(1 - a)).So, E = 1/(a(1 - a)) + 1/(a(1 - a)) = 2/(a(1 - a)).Which is the same as before, so E = 2/(ab), since ab = a(1 - a). So, same conclusion.Therefore, E is 2/(ab), which is minimized when ab is maximized, which is 1/4, so E_min = 8.Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill here since it's a simple optimization problem with one constraint.But just for thoroughness, let's set it up.We need to minimize E = 1/a + 1/b + 1/(ab) subject to the constraint a + b =1.We can set up the Lagrangian:L = 1/a + 1/b + 1/(ab) + λ(a + b -1)Take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, and λ, set them equal to zero.First, partial derivative with respect to a:dL/da = -1/a² - 1/(a² b) + λ = 0Similarly, partial derivative with respect to b:dL/db = -1/b² - 1/(a b²) + λ = 0Partial derivative with respect to λ:a + b -1 = 0So, from the first equation:-1/a² - 1/(a² b) + λ = 0 => λ = 1/a² + 1/(a² b)From the second equation:-1/b² - 1/(a b²) + λ = 0 => λ = 1/b² + 1/(a b²)Set the two expressions for λ equal:1/a² + 1/(a² b) = 1/b² + 1/(a b²)Multiply both sides by a² b² to eliminate denominators:b² + b = a² + aSo, b² + b = a² + aBut since a + b =1, we can substitute b =1 - a into this equation:(1 - a)² + (1 - a) = a² + aLet me compute the left side:(1 - 2a + a²) + (1 - a) = 1 - 2a + a² +1 - a = 2 - 3a + a²Right side is a² + aSet equal:2 - 3a + a² = a² + aSubtract a² from both sides:2 - 3a = aBring all terms to left:2 - 4a =0 => 4a =2 => a= 1/2Then, b=1 -1/2=1/2So, same result as before.Therefore, the minimum occurs at a=1/2, b=1/2, and E=8.So, I think that's thorough enough. I've approached it from multiple angles: directly substituting, using AM-GM inequality, calculus with substitution, and even Lagrange multipliers. All methods lead to the conclusion that the minimum value is 8.Just to recap:1. Found the center of the circle: (2, -1).2. Substituted into the line equation to get a + b =1.3. Expressed the target expression in terms of ab, found it's 2/(ab).4. Maximized ab under the constraint a + b =1, which occurs at a = b =1/2.5. Calculated E =8.Therefore, the minimum value is 8.**Final Answer**The minimum value is boxed{8}."},{"question":"If 3x^{4}y^{m} and -2x^{4}y^{2} are like terms, then m=______.","answer":"To determine the value of ( m ), I start by recognizing that like terms must have the same variables raised to the same exponents.Both terms have ( x^4 ), so the exponents of ( x ) are already equal.Next, I compare the exponents of ( y ) in both terms.

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me write down what's given. We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) divides ( 5^{n} + 3^{n} ). In mathematical terms, this means that ( 5^{n} + 3^{n} ) is a multiple of ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ). So, ( 5^{n} + 3^{n} = k(5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}) ) for some integer ( k ).Let me try to express ( 5^{n} + 3^{n} ) in terms of ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ). I know that ( 5^{n} = 5 cdot 5^{n-1} ) and ( 3^{n} = 3 cdot 3^{n-1} ). So, substituting these into the equation, we get:( 5 cdot 5^{n-1} + 3 cdot 3^{n-1} = k(5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}) ).Let me factor out ( 5^{n-1} ) and ( 3^{n-1} ) from the left side:( 5^{n-1}(5) + 3^{n-1}(3) = k(5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}) ).Hmm, so if I factor ( 5^{n-1} ) and ( 3^{n-1} ) out, it becomes:( 5 cdot 5^{n-1} + 3 cdot 3^{n-1} = k(5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}) ).Let me denote ( a = 5^{n-1} ) and ( b = 3^{n-1} ) to simplify the equation. Then the equation becomes:( 5a + 3b = k(a + b) ).So, ( 5a + 3b = k(a + b) ). Let's rearrange this equation to solve for ( k ):( k = frac{5a + 3b}{a + b} ).Since ( k ) must be an integer, the fraction ( frac{5a + 3b}{a + b} ) must simplify to an integer. Let me see if I can manipulate this fraction to find some condition on ( a ) and ( b ).First, let's write ( 5a + 3b ) as ( 5(a + b) - 2b ). Let me check:( 5(a + b) = 5a + 5b ), so subtracting ( 2b ) gives ( 5a + 3b ). Yes, that works. So,( frac{5a + 3b}{a + b} = frac{5(a + b) - 2b}{a + b} = 5 - frac{2b}{a + b} ).So, ( k = 5 - frac{2b}{a + b} ). Since ( k ) is an integer, ( frac{2b}{a + b} ) must also be an integer. Let me denote ( c = a + b ). Then, ( frac{2b}{c} ) must be an integer. So, ( c ) divides ( 2b ).But ( c = a + b = 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ), and ( b = 3^{n-1} ). So, ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) divides ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ). Therefore,( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) divides ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ).Let me write that as:( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} mid 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ).Hmm, so ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) is a divisor of ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ). That suggests that ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) must be less than or equal to ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ), right? Because a divisor can't be larger than the number it divides unless it's equal.Wait, actually, that's not necessarily true. For example, 6 divides 12, and 6 is equal to 12/2. So, the divisor can be smaller or equal. But in this case, ( 5^{n-1} ) is larger than ( 3^{n-1} ) for ( n geq 2 ), so ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) is definitely larger than ( 3^{n-1} ). Therefore, ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) is larger than ( 3^{n-1} ), so it can't divide ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) unless it's equal to ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) or a factor of it.Wait, but ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) is definitely larger than ( 3^{n-1} ), so for ( n geq 2 ), ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) is greater than ( 3^{n-1} ). So, the only way ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) divides ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) is if ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) is a divisor of ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ), which is only possible if ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) is less than or equal to ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ).Wait, but ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} leq 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) implies ( 5^{n-1} leq 3^{n-1} ). But ( 5 > 3 ), so ( 5^{n-1} ) grows faster than ( 3^{n-1} ). So, for ( n geq 2 ), ( 5^{n-1} > 3^{n-1} ), which would mean ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} > 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ). Therefore, the inequality ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} leq 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) is only possible if ( 5^{n-1} leq 3^{n-1} ), which is only true for ( n = 1 ).Wait, let me check for ( n = 1 ). If ( n = 1 ), then ( 5^{0} + 3^{0} = 1 + 1 = 2 ). And ( 5^{1} + 3^{1} = 5 + 3 = 8 ). So, does 2 divide 8? Yes, it does. So, ( n = 1 ) is a solution.But what about ( n = 2 )? Let me compute ( 5^{1} + 3^{1} = 5 + 3 = 8 ), and ( 5^{2} + 3^{2} = 25 + 9 = 34 ). Does 8 divide 34? 34 divided by 8 is 4.25, which is not an integer. So, no, ( n = 2 ) is not a solution.Similarly, ( n = 3 ): ( 5^{2} + 3^{2} = 25 + 9 = 34 ), and ( 5^{3} + 3^{3} = 125 + 27 = 152 ). Does 34 divide 152? Let's see: 34 times 4 is 136, 34 times 5 is 170, which is too big. So, 152 - 136 = 16, which is not a multiple of 34. So, no.Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me go back to the equation ( k = 5 - frac{2b}{a + b} ). Since ( k ) must be an integer, ( frac{2b}{a + b} ) must be an integer. Let me denote ( d = gcd(a, b) ). Then, ( a = d cdot m ) and ( b = d cdot n ), where ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ).So, ( a + b = d(m + n) ), and ( 2b = 2d n ). Therefore, ( frac{2b}{a + b} = frac{2d n}{d(m + n)} = frac{2n}{m + n} ). So, ( frac{2n}{m + n} ) must be an integer.Since ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ), ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime. So, ( m + n ) divides ( 2n ). Therefore, ( m + n ) divides ( 2n ). Since ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ), ( gcd(m + n, n) = gcd(m, n) = 1 ). Therefore, ( m + n ) divides 2.So, ( m + n ) is a divisor of 2. The positive divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.Case 1: ( m + n = 1 ). But ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers (since ( a = 5^{n-1} ) and ( b = 3^{n-1} ) are positive), so ( m + n = 1 ) implies ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 0 ), but ( n ) can't be zero because ( b = 3^{n-1} ) would be undefined for ( n = 1 ). Wait, actually, ( n ) is a positive integer, so ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers as well. So, ( m + n = 1 ) is impossible because both ( m ) and ( n ) are at least 1, so their sum is at least 2.Case 2: ( m + n = 2 ). So, ( m + n = 2 ). Since ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime positive integers, the only possibilities are ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 1 ).So, ( m = 1 ) and ( n = 1 ). Therefore, ( a = d cdot 1 = d ) and ( b = d cdot 1 = d ). So, ( a = b ). But ( a = 5^{n-1} ) and ( b = 3^{n-1} ). So, ( 5^{n-1} = 3^{n-1} ). This implies that ( (5/3)^{n-1} = 1 ), which is only possible if ( n - 1 = 0 ), so ( n = 1 ).Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 1 ).Wait, let me double-check. For ( n = 1 ), ( 5^{0} + 3^{0} = 2 ), and ( 5^{1} + 3^{1} = 8 ). 2 divides 8, so that's correct.For ( n = 2 ), as I computed earlier, 8 doesn't divide 34. For ( n = 3 ), 34 doesn't divide 152. Let me check ( n = 4 ): ( 5^{3} + 3^{3} = 125 + 27 = 152 ), and ( 5^{4} + 3^{4} = 625 + 81 = 706 ). Does 152 divide 706? 152 times 4 is 608, 706 - 608 = 98, which is not a multiple of 152. So, no.Similarly, for ( n = 5 ): ( 5^{4} + 3^{4} = 625 + 81 = 706 ), ( 5^{5} + 3^{5} = 3125 + 243 = 3368 ). Does 706 divide 3368? Let's see: 706 times 4 is 2824, 3368 - 2824 = 544. 544 divided by 706 is less than 1, so no.It seems like as ( n ) increases, ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) grows exponentially, and so does ( 5^{n} + 3^{n} ), but the ratio between them is approaching 5 as ( n ) becomes large because ( 5^{n} ) dominates over ( 3^{n} ). So, the ratio ( frac{5^{n} + 3^{n}}{5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}} ) approaches 5 as ( n ) increases. But since 5 is an integer, does that mean for some large ( n ) it might be exactly 5? Let me see.Wait, let's compute the ratio for ( n = 1 ): ( frac{5 + 3}{1 + 1} = frac{8}{2} = 4 ). For ( n = 2 ): ( frac{25 + 9}{5 + 3} = frac{34}{8} = 4.25 ). For ( n = 3 ): ( frac{125 + 27}{25 + 9} = frac{152}{34} approx 4.47 ). For ( n = 4 ): ( frac{625 + 81}{125 + 27} = frac{706}{152} approx 4.64 ). For ( n = 5 ): ( frac{3125 + 243}{625 + 81} = frac{3368}{706} approx 4.77 ). So, it's approaching 5, but it's always less than 5. So, the ratio is increasing and approaching 5, but never actually reaching 5 because ( 3^{n} ) is always positive.Therefore, for ( n > 1 ), the ratio ( frac{5^{n} + 3^{n}}{5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}} ) is not an integer because it's between 4 and 5, but not equal to an integer. Hence, the only solution is ( n = 1 ).Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's another approach. Let me consider the division:( 5^{n} + 3^{n} = q(5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}) + r ), where ( q ) is the quotient and ( r ) is the remainder. Since we are dividing by ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ), the remainder ( r ) must be less than ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ).But let's compute ( 5^{n} + 3^{n} ) divided by ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ). Let me write ( 5^{n} = 5 cdot 5^{n-1} ) and ( 3^{n} = 3 cdot 3^{n-1} ). So,( 5^{n} + 3^{n} = 5 cdot 5^{n-1} + 3 cdot 3^{n-1} ).Let me factor out ( 5^{n-1} ) and ( 3^{n-1} ):( 5^{n} + 3^{n} = 5^{n-1}(5) + 3^{n-1}(3) ).Now, let me write this as:( 5^{n} + 3^{n} = 5 cdot 5^{n-1} + 3 cdot 3^{n-1} = 5(5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}) - 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ).So, ( 5^{n} + 3^{n} = 5(5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}) - 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ).Therefore, when we divide ( 5^{n} + 3^{n} ) by ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ), we get:( frac{5^{n} + 3^{n}}{5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}} = 5 - frac{2 cdot 3^{n-1}}{5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}} ).So, for this to be an integer, ( frac{2 cdot 3^{n-1}}{5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}} ) must be an integer. Let me denote ( t = 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ). Then, ( frac{2 cdot 3^{n-1}}{t} ) must be an integer. So, ( t ) divides ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ).But ( t = 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ). Let me see if ( t ) divides ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ). Since ( t ) is greater than ( 3^{n-1} ) for ( n geq 2 ), as ( 5^{n-1} > 3^{n-1} ), the only way ( t ) divides ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) is if ( t ) is a factor of ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ). But ( t = 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ) is greater than ( 3^{n-1} ), so it can only divide ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) if ( t ) is equal to ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) or a smaller multiple.Wait, but ( t = 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} ). Let me see if ( 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} = 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ). That would imply ( 5^{n-1} = 3^{n-1} ), which only holds if ( n - 1 = 0 ), so ( n = 1 ). So, that's the only case where ( t = 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ).For ( n > 1 ), ( t = 5^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} > 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ), so ( t ) cannot divide ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ) because it's larger. Therefore, the only solution is ( n = 1 ).Wait, but let me check ( n = 1 ) again. ( 5^{0} + 3^{0} = 1 + 1 = 2 ), and ( 5^{1} + 3^{1} = 5 + 3 = 8 ). So, 2 divides 8, which is true. So, ( n = 1 ) works.Is there any other ( n ) where ( t ) divides ( 2 cdot 3^{n-1} )? For ( n = 2 ), ( t = 5 + 3 = 8 ), and ( 2 cdot 3^{1} = 6 ). Does 8 divide 6? No. For ( n = 3 ), ( t = 25 + 9 = 34 ), and ( 2 cdot 3^{2} = 18 ). Does 34 divide 18? No. For ( n = 4 ), ( t = 125 + 27 = 152 ), and ( 2 cdot 3^{3} = 54 ). Does 152 divide 54? No. So, indeed, only ( n = 1 ) works.Therefore, the only strictly positive integer ( n ) satisfying the condition is ( n = 1 ).**Final Answer**The only strictly positive integer ( n ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"The 26 letters of the English alphabet are listed in an infinite, repeating loop:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC ...What is the 258^{text{th}} letter in this sequence?(A) V(B) W(C) X(D) Y(E) Z","answer":"First, I recognize that the English alphabet consists of 26 letters, which repeat in a continuous loop.To determine the 258th letter in this sequence, I need to find out which position within the repeating cycle corresponds to the 258th position.I can do this by dividing 258 by 26 and finding the remainder.

There's a bug that starts on point 5, and it jumps around the circle.

I need to figure out where the bug will be after 1995 jumps. The options are points 1 through 5, labeled (A) to (E).First, I should probably try to understand the movement pattern of the bug.

Let me write this down more clearly:Jump 0 (starting): 5Jump 1: 5 (odd) -> 1Jump 2: 1 (odd) -> 2Jump 3: 2 (even) -> 4Jump 4: 4 (even) -> 1Jump 5: 1 (odd) -> 2Jump 6: 2 (even) -> 4Jump 7: 4 (even) -> 1Jump 8: 1 (odd) -> 2Jump 9: 2 (even) -> 4Jump 10: 4 (even) -> 1Hmm, so after the first jump, it goes to 1. Then from 1, it goes to 2, then to 4, then to 1, and then it repeats: 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, etc.So, starting from jump 2, it's in a cycle of 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1,... So the cycle length is 3 jumps: 2 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 1...Wait, let's count the jumps:Jump 1: 5 -> 1Jump 2: 1 -> 2Jump 3: 2 -> 4Jump 4: 4 -> 1Jump 5: 1 -> 2Jump 6: 2 -> 4Jump 7: 4 -> 1So, starting from jump 2, every 3 jumps, it cycles through 2, 4, 1. So the cycle is 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1,...So, if I can figure out how many jumps are in the cycle after the initial jump, I can compute the position after 1995 jumps.Wait, starting from jump 1: position 1.Then, from jump 2 onwards, it's a cycle of 3: 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1,...So, the total number of jumps is 1995. The first jump takes it to position 1, and then the remaining 1994 jumps are part of the cycle.Wait, no. Wait, starting at jump 0: position 5.Jump 1: position 1Jump 2: position 2Jump 3: position 4Jump 4: position 1So, starting from jump 1, it's position 1, then the cycle starts at jump 2.So, the cycle is positions 2, 4, 1, which is 3 positions, and each cycle takes 3 jumps.So, after jump 1, it's at position 1. Then, starting from jump 2, each cycle of 3 jumps brings it back to position 1.So, the number of jumps after the first one is 1995 - 1 = 1994 jumps.Now, 1994 divided by 3 gives the number of complete cycles and the remainder tells us the position in the cycle.So, 1994 divided by 3: 3*664 = 1992, so 1994 = 3*664 + 2, so the remainder is 2.So, starting from position 1 at jump 1, after 1994 jumps, which is 664 full cycles (each bringing it back to 1) plus 2 more jumps.Each cycle is 2, 4, 1.So, starting from 1:First jump in the cycle: 1 -> 2Second jump: 2 -> 4Third jump: 4 -> 1So, if we have a remainder of 2, that means after 664 cycles (which bring it back to 1), it does 2 more jumps:First jump: 1 -> 2Second jump: 2 -> 4So, after 1994 jumps from jump 1, it's at position 4.But wait, hold on. Let me make sure.Wait, starting at jump 1: position 1.Then, each cycle is 3 jumps: 2, 4, 1.So, after 1994 jumps, which is 664 cycles (3*664=1992) plus 2 jumps.So, starting from position 1:After 1992 jumps (664 cycles), it's back at position 1.Then, 2 more jumps:Jump 1993: 1 -> 2Jump 1994: 2 -> 4So, after 1994 jumps from jump 1, it's at position 4.But wait, the total number of jumps is 1995. So, starting from jump 0 (position 5), jump 1 is position 1, and then 1994 more jumps bring it to position 4.So, after 1995 jumps, it's on position 4.Wait, but let me check this again because sometimes when dealing with modular arithmetic, it's easy to make an off-by-one error.Alternatively, maybe I can model the positions as a sequence and see if there's a cycle.Let me list the positions step by step:Jump 0: 5Jump 1: 1Jump 2: 2Jump 3: 4Jump 4: 1Jump 5: 2Jump 6: 4Jump 7: 1Jump 8: 2Jump 9: 4Jump 10: 1So, from jump 1 onwards, the positions are 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1,...So, starting at jump 1, the cycle is 1, 2, 4, repeating every 3 jumps.So, the sequence from jump 1 is a cycle of length 3: 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4,...Therefore, the position after n jumps can be determined as follows:If n = 0: 5If n >= 1: the position is the (n - 1)th term in the cycle [1, 2, 4]So, for n = 1: term 0: 1n = 2: term 1: 2n = 3: term 2: 4n = 4: term 3: 1 (since 3 mod 3 = 0)Wait, so the cycle is [1, 2, 4], and the term number is (n - 1) mod 3.So, for n = 1995, the term number is 1995 - 1 = 1994.1994 mod 3: 1994 divided by 3 is 664 with a remainder of 2.So, term number 1994 corresponds to index 2 in the cycle [1, 2, 4], which is 4.So, the position after 1995 jumps is 4.Wait, but let me make sure.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a function.Let me denote the position after k jumps as P(k).Given P(0) = 5.For k >= 1,If P(k-1) is odd, then P(k) = (P(k-1) + 1) mod 5, but since it's a circle, if it's 5, moving 1 would be 1.Wait, actually, the points are 1,2,3,4,5, so moving from 5, one point clockwise is 1, two points is 2, etc.So, perhaps it's better to model the positions as numbers 1-5, and moving 1 or 2 positions, modulo 5, but adjusted because 5 is equivalent to 0 in mod 5.Wait, maybe it's better to map the positions to 0-4 for easier modulo operations, then convert back.Let me try that.Let me assign:Position 1: 0Position 2: 1Position 3: 2Position 4: 3Position 5: 4So, moving one position clockwise is equivalent to adding 1 modulo 5.Moving two positions is adding 2 modulo 5.But since the bug moves 1 or 2 positions depending on whether it's on an odd or even point.But in this mapping, odd positions are 1,3,5 which correspond to 0,2,4.Even positions are 2,4 which correspond to 1,3.So, if the bug is on a position corresponding to 0,2,4 (original 1,3,5), it moves 1 step (add 1).If it's on 1,3 (original 2,4), it moves 2 steps (add 2).So, let's model this.Let me denote the current position as x (0-4). Then:If x is even (0,2,4), next position is (x + 1) mod 5.If x is odd (1,3), next position is (x + 2) mod 5.So, starting from position 5, which is 4 in our mapping.So, starting at x=4.Let me compute the sequence:x0 = 4x1: since x0=4 is even, x1 = (4 + 1) mod 5 = 0x2: x1=0 is even, x2 = (0 + 1) mod 5 = 1x3: x2=1 is odd, x3 = (1 + 2) mod 5 = 3x4: x3=3 is odd, x4 = (3 + 2) mod 5 = 5 mod 5 = 0x5: x4=0 is even, x5 = (0 + 1) mod 5 = 1x6: x5=1 is odd, x6 = (1 + 2) mod 5 = 3x7: x6=3 is odd, x7 = (3 + 2) mod 5 = 0x8: x7=0 is even, x8 = (0 + 1) mod 5 = 1x9: x8=1 is odd, x9 = (1 + 2) mod 5 = 3x10: x9=3 is odd, x10 = (3 + 2) mod 5 = 0So, the sequence in mapped positions is:4, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0,...So, starting from x0=4, the sequence is 4, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0,...So, after the first step, it's in a cycle of 0,1,3,0,1,3,...Which is a cycle of length 3: 0,1,3.So, starting from x1=0, the cycle is 0,1,3,0,1,3,...So, the positions after the first jump are in a cycle of length 3.So, for k >=1, the position xk is in the cycle [0,1,3].So, the term number is k -1.So, for k=1995, term number is 1995 -1 = 1994.So, 1994 mod 3: 1994 divided by 3 is 664 with a remainder of 2.So, term number 1994 corresponds to index 2 in the cycle [0,1,3], which is 3.So, x1995 = 3, which corresponds to position 4 (since 3 maps back to 4).Therefore, the bug is on position 4 after 1995 jumps.Wait, that seems consistent with my earlier conclusion.But just to make sure, let me check with smaller numbers.For example, after 1 jump: position 1 (mapped to 0). Correct.After 2 jumps: position 2 (mapped to 1). Correct.After 3 jumps: position 4 (mapped to 3). Correct.After 4 jumps: position 1 (mapped to 0). Correct.After 5 jumps: position 2 (mapped to 1). Correct.After 6 jumps: position 4 (mapped to 3). Correct.So, yes, the cycle is 0,1,3,0,1,3,...So, for k=1995, it's 3, which is position 4.Therefore, the answer should be D) 4.Wait, but let me think again because sometimes when dealing with cycles, the starting point can affect the count.Wait, the cycle starts at k=1, which is position 0 (mapped to 1). So, the cycle is positions 0,1,3,0,1,3,...So, for k=1: 0k=2:1k=3:3k=4:0k=5:1k=6:3So, the cycle is 0,1,3, repeating every 3 jumps.So, the term number is k -1.So, for k=1995, term number is 1994.1994 divided by 3 is 664 with a remainder of 2.So, term number 1994 is the 2nd index in the cycle [0,1,3], which is 3.So, x1995=3, which is position 4.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.Let me denote the position after n jumps as P(n). Then, P(0)=5.For n >=1,If P(n-1) is odd, then P(n) = (P(n-1) +1) mod 5. But since it's a circle, if it's 5, adding 1 would be 1.Wait, but in mod 5, 5 is equivalent to 0, so perhaps better to adjust.Wait, maybe it's better to use modular arithmetic with 1-based indexing.Alternatively, think of the positions as 1-5, and moving 1 or 2 steps.So, from position p, next position is:If p is odd: (p +1) if p <5, else 1.If p is even: (p +2) if p +2 <=5, else (p +2 -5).Wait, that might complicate things, but perhaps it's manageable.Alternatively, use modulo 5, but adjust for 1-based indexing.So, position p: next position is (p + move) mod 5, but if the result is 0, it's 5.So, for p odd: move=1, so next position is (p +1) mod 5, if 0, then 5.For p even: move=2, so next position is (p +2) mod 5, if 0, then 5.So, starting at p=5.p0=5p1: 5 is odd, so (5 +1)=6 mod5=1p2:1 is odd, (1 +1)=2p3:2 is even, (2 +2)=4p4:4 is even, (4 +2)=6 mod5=1p5:1 is odd, (1 +1)=2p6:2 is even, (2 +2)=4p7:4 is even, (4 +2)=6 mod5=1p8:1 is odd, (1 +1)=2p9:2 is even, (2 +2)=4p10:4 is even, (4 +2)=6 mod5=1So, same as before, the cycle is 1,2,4,1,2,4,...So, starting from p1=1, it's a cycle of 3.Therefore, for n >=1, the position is determined by (n -1) mod 3.If (n -1) mod3=0: position1=1: position2=2: position4So, for n=1995,(1995 -1)=19941994 mod3: 1994 /3=664*3=1992, remainder 2.So, 1994 mod3=2.Therefore, position is 4.So, the answer is D)4.I think this is consistent across different methods: simulating the first few steps, mapping to modular arithmetic, and using recurrence relations.Therefore, I'm confident that after 1995 jumps, the bug will be on point 4.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"The prime numbers between 10 and 20 are added together to form the number Q.

Let me write down the coordinates first to make sure I have everything straight.M₁ is (2, 3, 1), M₂ is (4, 1, -2), M₃ is (6, 3, 7), and M₀ is (-5, -4, 8). Alright, so I need to find the equation of the plane first, right? Once I have the equation of the plane, I can use the distance formula from a point to a plane.Hmm, how do I find the equation of a plane given three points? I remember that the general equation of a plane is ax + by + cz + d = 0. To find a, b, c, I can use the normal vector to the plane. The normal vector can be found by taking the cross product of two vectors that lie on the plane.So, first, I need two vectors that lie on the plane. I can get these vectors by subtracting the coordinates of M₁ from M₂ and M₃. Let me compute those vectors.Vector M₁M₂ is M₂ - M₁, which is (4-2, 1-3, -2-1) = (2, -2, -3).Vector M₁M₃ is M₃ - M₁, which is (6-2, 3-3, 7-1) = (4, 0, 6).Okay, so now I have two vectors: (2, -2, -3) and (4, 0, 6). I need to find their cross product to get the normal vector.The cross product of vectors (a, b, c) and (d, e, f) is given by:(b*f - c*e, c*d - a*f, a*e - b*d)So, plugging in the values:First component: (-2)*6 - (-3)*0 = (-12) - 0 = -12Second component: (-3)*4 - 2*6 = (-12) - 12 = -24Wait, hold on. Is that right? Let me double-check the cross product formula.Actually, the cross product is:(i, j, k)|a b c||d e f|Which is i*(b*f - c*e) - j*(a*f - c*d) + k*(a*e - b*d)So, the components are:i: b*f - c*e = (-2)*6 - (-3)*0 = -12 - 0 = -12j: -(a*f - c*d) = -(2*6 - (-3)*4) = -(12 - (-12)) = -(24) = -24k: a*e - b*d = 2*0 - (-2)*4 = 0 - (-8) = 8So, the cross product is (-12, -24, 8). Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but okay.So, the normal vector n is (-12, -24, 8). Maybe I can simplify this by dividing by a common factor. Let's see, all components are divisible by 4.Dividing each component by 4: (-3, -6, 2). So, the normal vector can be simplified to (-3, -6, 2). That should make things a bit easier.Now, the equation of the plane can be written as:-3(x - x₀) -6(y - y₀) + 2(z - z₀) = 0Where (x₀, y₀, z₀) is a point on the plane. I can use M₁ for this, which is (2, 3, 1).Plugging in:-3(x - 2) -6(y - 3) + 2(z - 1) = 0Let me expand this:-3x + 6 -6y + 18 + 2z - 2 = 0Combine like terms:-3x -6y + 2z + (6 + 18 - 2) = 0Which simplifies to:-3x -6y + 2z + 22 = 0Wait, 6 + 18 is 24, minus 2 is 22. So, the equation is -3x -6y + 2z + 22 = 0.Hmm, it's a bit unusual to have negative coefficients, but I think that's okay. Alternatively, I could multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficients positive, but it's not necessary. Let me check if this plane equation is correct by plugging in the points.Let's test M₁(2, 3, 1):-3*2 -6*3 + 2*1 + 22 = (-6) -18 + 2 + 22 = (-24) + 24 = 0. Okay, that works.M₂(4, 1, -2):-3*4 -6*1 + 2*(-2) + 22 = (-12) -6 -4 + 22 = (-22) + 22 = 0. Good.M₃(6, 3, 7):-3*6 -6*3 + 2*7 + 22 = (-18) -18 +14 +22 = (-36) + 36 = 0. Perfect, so the plane equation is correct.Now, to find the distance from M₀(-5, -4, 8) to this plane. The distance formula from a point (x₀, y₀, z₀) to the plane ax + by + cz + d = 0 is:Distance = |a*x₀ + b*y₀ + c*z₀ + d| / sqrt(a² + b² + c²)So, in our case, the plane equation is -3x -6y + 2z + 22 = 0. So, a = -3, b = -6, c = 2, d = 22.Wait, hold on. The standard form is ax + by + cz + d = 0, so in our case, it's -3x -6y + 2z + 22 = 0. So, actually, a = -3, b = -6, c = 2, d = 22.But in the distance formula, it's |a*x₀ + b*y₀ + c*z₀ + d|, so plugging in M₀(-5, -4, 8):Numerator: |-3*(-5) + (-6)*(-4) + 2*8 + 22|Let me compute each term:-3*(-5) = 15-6*(-4) = 242*8 = 16And then +22.So, adding them up: 15 + 24 = 39; 39 + 16 = 55; 55 + 22 = 77.So, the numerator is |77| = 77.Denominator: sqrt(a² + b² + c²) = sqrt((-3)^2 + (-6)^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(9 + 36 + 4) = sqrt(49) = 7.Therefore, the distance is 77 / 7 = 11.Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations.Compute numerator:-3*(-5) = 15-6*(-4) = 242*8 = 16Sum: 15 + 24 = 39; 39 + 16 = 55; 55 + 22 = 77. Absolute value is 77.Denominator:sqrt(9 + 36 + 4) = sqrt(49) = 7.So, 77 / 7 = 11. That seems correct.Alternatively, just to be thorough, I can write the plane equation in a different form and see if I get the same result.Alternatively, if I had multiplied the plane equation by -1, it would be 3x + 6y - 2z -22 = 0. Then, the distance formula would be |3*(-5) + 6*(-4) -2*8 -22| / sqrt(3² + 6² + (-2)^2)Compute numerator:3*(-5) = -156*(-4) = -24-2*8 = -16-22Sum: -15 -24 = -39; -39 -16 = -55; -55 -22 = -77. Absolute value is 77.Denominator: sqrt(9 + 36 + 4) = sqrt(49) = 7.So, 77 / 7 = 11. Same result. So, that's consistent.Therefore, the distance is 11 units.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the cross product earlier. Let me recompute that.Vectors M₁M₂ = (2, -2, -3) and M₁M₃ = (4, 0, 6).Cross product:i: (-2)(6) - (-3)(0) = -12 - 0 = -12j: -( (2)(6) - (-3)(4) ) = -(12 - (-12)) = -(24) = -24k: (2)(0) - (-2)(4) = 0 - (-8) = 8So, cross product is (-12, -24, 8). Then, simplifying by dividing by 4 gives (-3, -6, 2). Correct.So, the normal vector is (-3, -6, 2). So, plane equation is -3x -6y + 2z + d = 0. Plugging in M₁(2, 3, 1):-3*2 -6*3 + 2*1 + d = -6 -18 + 2 + d = -22 + d = 0 => d = 22.So, plane equation is -3x -6y + 2z + 22 = 0. Correct.Therefore, the distance is indeed 11. So, I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The distance from point ( M_{0} ) to the plane is boxed{11}."},{"question":"In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_1+a_2+ldots+a_9=81 and a_2+a_3+ldots+a_{10}=171, then the common difference d= ___.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an arithmetic sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first nine terms is 81, and the sum from the second term to the tenth term is 171. I need to find the common difference d.Hmm, arithmetic sequences. I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is the previous term plus a common difference d. So, the nth term can be written as a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term.Also, the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d) or sometimes written as S_n = n*(a_1 + a_n)/2. Both formulas are equivalent because a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.Alright, so let's write down what we know.First, the sum of the first nine terms is 81. So, S_9 = 81.Using the sum formula, S_9 = 9/2 * (2a_1 + 8d) = 81.Let me write that equation:(9/2)*(2a_1 + 8d) = 81.I can simplify this. Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:9*(2a_1 + 8d) = 162.Divide both sides by 9:2a_1 + 8d = 18.Let me write that as equation (1):2a_1 + 8d = 18.Okay, now the second piece of information is that the sum from the second term to the tenth term is 171. So, that's the sum of terms a_2 to a_10.I can think of this as the sum of the first ten terms minus the first term. Because S_10 = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_10, so S_10 - a_1 = a_2 + ... + a_10.So, the sum from a_2 to a_10 is S_10 - a_1 = 171.So, let's compute S_10 first.Using the sum formula again, S_10 = 10/2*(2a_1 + 9d) = 5*(2a_1 + 9d).So, S_10 = 5*(2a_1 + 9d).Therefore, S_10 - a_1 = 171.So, 5*(2a_1 + 9d) - a_1 = 171.Let me simplify this equation.First, expand the 5:10a_1 + 45d - a_1 = 171.Combine like terms:(10a_1 - a_1) + 45d = 171.So, 9a_1 + 45d = 171.Let me write that as equation (2):9a_1 + 45d = 171.Now, I have two equations:Equation (1): 2a_1 + 8d = 18.Equation (2): 9a_1 + 45d = 171.I need to solve this system of equations for a_1 and d.Hmm, maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.First, let me see if I can make the coefficients of a_1 the same or something.Looking at equation (1): 2a_1 + 8d = 18.Equation (2): 9a_1 + 45d = 171.Hmm, equation (2) looks like it's a multiple of equation (1). Let me check.If I multiply equation (1) by 4.5, would I get equation (2)?Let's see: 2a_1 * 4.5 = 9a_1.8d * 4.5 = 36d.18 * 4.5 = 81.But equation (2) is 9a_1 + 45d = 171, which is different.So, no, they are not multiples. So, I can't directly eliminate one variable by subtracting.Alternatively, maybe I can solve equation (1) for a_1 and substitute into equation (2).Let me try that.From equation (1):2a_1 + 8d = 18.Subtract 8d from both sides:2a_1 = 18 - 8d.Divide both sides by 2:a_1 = (18 - 8d)/2 = 9 - 4d.So, a_1 = 9 - 4d.Now, substitute this into equation (2):9a_1 + 45d = 171.Replace a_1 with (9 - 4d):9*(9 - 4d) + 45d = 171.Let me compute this:First, multiply out the 9:81 - 36d + 45d = 171.Combine like terms:(-36d + 45d) + 81 = 171.So, 9d + 81 = 171.Subtract 81 from both sides:9d = 171 - 81 = 90.Divide both sides by 9:d = 10.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, d = 10.Let me check if that makes sense.If d = 10, then from equation (1):2a_1 + 8*10 = 18.2a_1 + 80 = 18.2a_1 = 18 - 80 = -62.a_1 = -31.So, the first term is -31, and the common difference is 10.Let me verify the sums.First, the sum of the first nine terms.Using S_9 = 9/2*(2a_1 + 8d).Plug in a_1 = -31, d = 10:S_9 = 9/2*(2*(-31) + 8*10) = 9/2*(-62 + 80) = 9/2*(18) = 9*9 = 81. That's correct.Now, the sum from a_2 to a_10.We can compute S_10 - a_1.Compute S_10:S_10 = 10/2*(2*(-31) + 9*10) = 5*(-62 + 90) = 5*28 = 140.So, S_10 = 140.Therefore, S_10 - a_1 = 140 - (-31) = 140 + 31 = 171. That's correct.So, both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, d = 10 is the correct answer.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.Let me recompute S_9:a_1 = -31, d = 10.So, the first nine terms are:a1: -31a2: -31 +10 = -21a3: -21 +10 = -11a4: -11 +10 = -1a5: -1 +10 = 9a6: 9 +10 =19a7:19 +10=29a8:29 +10=39a9:39 +10=49Sum them up:-31 + (-21) + (-11) + (-1) +9 +19 +29 +39 +49.Let me add them step by step:Start with -31.-31 + (-21) = -52.-52 + (-11) = -63.-63 + (-1) = -64.-64 +9 = -55.-55 +19 = -36.-36 +29 = -7.-7 +39 = 32.32 +49 = 81.Yes, that adds up to 81.Now, the sum from a2 to a10.a2 to a10 are:-21, -11, -1, 9,19,29,39,49,59.Wait, a10 is a1 +9d = -31 +90=59.So, terms are:-21, -11, -1, 9,19,29,39,49,59.Let me sum them:-21 + (-11) = -32.-32 + (-1) = -33.-33 +9 = -24.-24 +19 = -5.-5 +29 =24.24 +39=63.63 +49=112.112 +59=171.Yes, that adds up to 171.So, both sums are correct. Therefore, the common difference d is indeed 10.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.**Final Answer**The common difference ( d ) is boxed{10}."},{"question":"The distance between the two lines l_{1}: 3x-4y-2=0 and l_{2}: 3x-4y+8=0 is ____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the distance between two lines, l₁: 3x - 4y - 2 = 0 and l₂: 3x - 4y + 8 = 0. Hmm, I remember that the distance between two parallel lines can be found using a specific formula. Let me try to recall how that works.First, I should check if these lines are parallel. To do that, I can look at their slopes. The general form of a line is Ax + By + C = 0, and the slope is -A/B. For l₁, A is 3 and B is -4, so the slope is -3/(-4) which simplifies to 3/4. For l₂, A is also 3 and B is -4, so the slope is the same, 3/4. Since the slopes are equal, the lines are indeed parallel. That means I can use the distance formula for parallel lines.Now, the formula for the distance between two parallel lines Ax + By + C₁ = 0 and Ax + By + C₂ = 0 is |C₁ - C₂| divided by the square root of (A² + B²). Let me write that down to make sure I have it right:Distance = |C₁ - C₂| / √(A² + B²)Alright, so in this case, for l₁, the equation is 3x - 4y - 2 = 0, so C₁ is -2. For l₂, the equation is 3x - 4y + 8 = 0, so C₂ is +8. Let me plug these into the formula.First, calculate the numerator: |C₁ - C₂| = |-2 - 8| = |-10| = 10.Next, calculate the denominator: √(A² + B²) = √(3² + (-4)²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.So, putting it all together, the distance is 10 divided by 5, which is 2.Wait, let me double-check that. I think I might have messed up the signs somewhere. The formula is |C₁ - C₂|, so it's |-2 - 8|. That is |-10|, which is 10. Yeah, that's correct. The denominator is √(9 + 16) = 5. So 10 divided by 5 is indeed 2. Okay, that seems right.Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think about another way to approach this. Maybe pick a point on one line and find its distance to the other line. That should give the same result.Let's choose a point on l₁. For simplicity, let me set x = 0. Then, plugging into l₁: 3(0) - 4y - 2 = 0 => -4y - 2 = 0 => -4y = 2 => y = -0.5. So the point is (0, -0.5).Now, let's find the distance from this point (0, -0.5) to the line l₂: 3x - 4y + 8 = 0. The distance formula from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is |Ax₀ + By₀ + C| / √(A² + B²).Plugging in the values: |3(0) - 4(-0.5) + 8| / √(3² + (-4)²) = |0 + 2 + 8| / 5 = |10| / 5 = 10/5 = 2. Hmm, same result. So that confirms it.Alternatively, I could have chosen a different point. Let me try another one just to be thorough. Maybe set y = 0 on l₁. Then, 3x - 4(0) - 2 = 0 => 3x - 2 = 0 => x = 2/3. So the point is (2/3, 0).Now, find the distance from (2/3, 0) to l₂: 3x - 4y + 8 = 0.Using the distance formula: |3*(2/3) - 4*(0) + 8| / √(9 + 16) = |2 + 0 + 8| / 5 = |10| / 5 = 2. Again, the same answer. Okay, so that seems consistent.Wait, maybe I should also recall why the formula works. The distance between two parallel lines is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line. Since both lines are parallel, this distance is constant everywhere. So, by choosing any point on one line and computing its distance to the other line, I get the distance between the two lines. That makes sense.Alternatively, the formula |C₁ - C₂| / √(A² + B²) is derived from this concept. If you have two lines with the same A and B coefficients, their difference in the constant term C gives a measure of how far apart they are, scaled by the length of the vector (A, B), which is the denominator √(A² + B²). So, that's another way to think about it.Just to make sure I didn't confuse the formula, sometimes I see it written as |C₂ - C₁| / √(A² + B²), but since it's absolute value, the order doesn't matter. So |-2 - 8| is the same as |8 - (-2)|, which is also 10. So, either way, it's the same result.Another thing to note is that if the lines weren't parallel, this formula wouldn't work because the distance between two non-parallel lines isn't constant; they would intersect at some point, and the distance would be zero at that point. But since these lines are parallel, the distance is consistent everywhere.I think I've covered all the bases here. I checked the formula, verified it with two different points, and even thought through why the formula works. So, I feel confident that the distance between these two lines is 2 units.**Final Answer**The distance between the two lines is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Let S_{n} be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_{n}}, a_{2}=5, S_{n+1}=S_{n}+a_{n}+4; {b_{n}} is a geometric sequence, b_{2}=9, b_{1}+b_{3}=30, with a common ratio q gt 1.

Arrange the elements of Acup B in ascending order to form a new sequence {c_{n}}. Find T_{20}=c_{1}+c_{2}+c_{3}+cdots +c_{20}.","answer":"Alright, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit involved, but I'll take it one part at a time.First, the problem is divided into two main parts: part (1) asks for the general formulas of two sequences, {a_n} and {b_n}, and part (2) involves forming a new sequence from the union of these two sets and finding the sum of the first 20 terms of this new sequence.Starting with part (1). Let's focus on the sequence {a_n} first.We are given that S_n is the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}. So, S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n. We also know that a_2 = 5. Additionally, we have the recurrence relation S_{n+1} = S_n + a_n + 4.Hmm, let me parse this. S_{n+1} is the sum of the first n+1 terms, which is equal to S_n (the sum of the first n terms) plus a_n plus 4. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because S_{n+1} is usually equal to S_n + a_{n+1}. So, according to the given recurrence, S_{n+1} = S_n + a_n + 4. But normally, S_{n+1} = S_n + a_{n+1}. Therefore, equating these two expressions:S_n + a_{n+1} = S_n + a_n + 4Subtracting S_n from both sides, we get:a_{n+1} = a_n + 4Ah, okay, so this tells us that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. That is, each term is 4 more than the previous term.Given that, we can write the general formula for {a_n}. But we need to find the first term, a_1, to write the explicit formula.We know that a_2 = 5. Since it's an arithmetic sequence with common difference 4, we can write:a_2 = a_1 + 4 = 5So, solving for a_1:a_1 = 5 - 4 = 1Therefore, the first term is 1, and the common difference is 4. So, the general formula for {a_n} is:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = 1 + (n - 1)*4 = 4n - 3Let me verify this. For n=1, a_1=1; n=2, a_2=5; n=3, a_3=9; and so on. Each term increases by 4, which matches the recurrence relation. So, that seems correct.Now, moving on to the geometric sequence {b_n}. We are told that b_2 = 9, and b_1 + b_3 = 30. The common ratio q is greater than 1.Since it's a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by q. So, b_2 = b_1 * q = 9, and b_3 = b_2 * q = 9q.We are also told that b_1 + b_3 = 30. So, substituting the expressions in terms of b_1 and q:b_1 + b_3 = b_1 + 9q = 30But from b_2 = b_1 * q = 9, we can express b_1 as 9 / q.Substituting b_1 = 9 / q into the equation b_1 + 9q = 30:(9 / q) + 9q = 30Let me write that equation:9/q + 9q = 30I can factor out the 9:9(1/q + q) = 30Divide both sides by 9:1/q + q = 30/9 = 10/3So, we have:q + 1/q = 10/3Multiply both sides by q to eliminate the denominator:q^2 + 1 = (10/3)qBring all terms to one side:q^2 - (10/3)q + 1 = 0To make it easier, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:3q^2 - 10q + 3 = 0Now, we have a quadratic equation in q:3q^2 - 10q + 3 = 0Let's solve for q using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is q = [10 ± sqrt(100 - 36)] / 6Compute discriminant D:D = 100 - 4*3*3 = 100 - 36 = 64So, sqrt(D) = 8Therefore, q = [10 ± 8]/6So, two solutions:q = (10 + 8)/6 = 18/6 = 3q = (10 - 8)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3But we are told that q > 1, so we take q = 3.Therefore, the common ratio is 3.Now, since b_2 = 9 and q = 3, we can find b_1:b_2 = b_1 * q => 9 = b_1 * 3 => b_1 = 3Therefore, the first term is 3, and the common ratio is 3. So, the general formula for {b_n} is:b_n = b_1 * q^{n-1} = 3 * 3^{n-1} = 3^nWait, let me check that. For n=1, b_1=3; n=2, b_2=9; n=3, b_3=27; which matches the given b_1 + b_3 = 3 + 27 = 30. Perfect.So, summarizing part (1):{a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a_1=1 and d=4, so a_n = 4n - 3.{b_n} is a geometric sequence with b_1=3 and q=3, so b_n = 3^n.Moving on to part (2). We need to form sets A and B from the terms of {a_n} and {b_n}, respectively. Then, take the union A ∪ B, arrange the elements in ascending order to form a new sequence {c_n}, and find T_{20} = c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_{20}.So, to approach this, I think I need to list out the terms of both sequences, combine them, remove duplicates, sort them in ascending order, and then sum the first 20 terms.But since both sequences are infinite, we need to figure out how many terms from each sequence are needed to cover up to the 20th term in the combined sequence.Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to interleave the terms of {a_n} and {b_n} in ascending order and compute the sum accordingly.First, let me list out the terms of {a_n} and {b_n} to see how they interleave.For {a_n}: a_n = 4n - 3. So, the terms are:n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, ...a_n: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, ...For {b_n}: b_n = 3^n. So, the terms are:n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, ...b_n: 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683, 59049, 177147, 531441, 1594323, 4782969, 14348907, 43046721, 129140163, 387420489, 1162261467, 3486784401, ...Wait, hold on, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, etc. So, the terms of {b_n} grow exponentially, while {a_n} grows linearly.Therefore, initially, the terms of {a_n} and {b_n} will interleave, but as n increases, the terms of {b_n} will quickly surpass those of {a_n}.So, to form the sequence {c_n}, we need to merge the two sequences, removing duplicates, and arrange them in ascending order.First, let's list out the terms of both sequences until the point where the terms of {b_n} become larger than the terms of {a_n}.Looking at the terms:From {a_n}: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 97, 101, 105, 109, 113, 117, 121, 125, 129, 133, 137, 141, 145, 149, 153, 157, 161, 165, 169, 173, 177, 181, 185, 189, 193, 197, 201, 205, 209, 213, 217, 221, 225, 229, 233, 237, 241, 245, 249, 253, 257, 261, 265, 269, 273, 277, 281, 285, 289, 293, 297, 301, 305, 309, 313, 317, 321, 325, 329, 333, 337, 341, 345, 349, 353, 357, 361, 365, 369, 373, 377, 381, 385, 389, 393, 397, 401, 405, 409, 413, 417, 421, 425, 429, 433, 437, 441, 445, 449, 453, 457, 461, 465, 469, 473, 477, 481, 485, 489, 493, 497, 501, 505, 509, 513, 517, 521, 525, 529, 533, 537, 541, 545, 549, 553, 557, 561, 565, 569, 573, 577, 581, 585, 589, 593, 597, 601, 605, 609, 613, 617, 621, 625, 629, 633, 637, 641, 645, 649, 653, 657, 661, 665, 669, 673, 677, 681, 685, 689, 693, 697, 701, 705, 709, 713, 717, 721, 725, 729, ...From {b_n}: 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683, 59049, 177147, 531441, 1594323, 4782969, 14348907, 43046721, 129140163, 387420489, 1162261467, 3486784401, ...So, let's see where the terms of {b_n} start to overtake {a_n}. Let's list them side by side:n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, ...a_n: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 97, 101, 105, 109, 113, 117, 121, 125, 129, 133, 137, 141, 145, 149, 153, 157, 161, 165, 169, 173, 177, 181, 185, 189, 193, 197, 201, 205, 209, 213, 217, 221, 225, 229, 233, 237, 241, 245, 249, 253, 257, 261, 265, 269, 273, 277, 281, 285, 289, 293, 297, 301, 305, 309, 313, 317, 321, 325, 329, 333, 337, 341, 345, 349, 353, 357, 361, 365, 369, 373, 377, 381, 385, 389, 393, 397, 401, 405, 409, 413, 417, 421, 425, 429, 433, 437, 441, 445, 449, 453, 457, 461, 465, 469, 473, 477, 481, 485, 489, 493, 497, 501, 505, 509, 513, 517, 521, 525, 529, 533, 537, 541, 545, 549, 553, 557, 561, 565, 569, 573, 577, 581, 585, 589, 593, 597, 601, 605, 609, 613, 617, 621, 625, 629, 633, 637, 641, 645, 649, 653, 657, 661, 665, 669, 673, 677, 681, 685, 689, 693, 697, 701, 705, 709, 713, 717, 721, 725, 729, ...b_n: 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683, 59049, 177147, 531441, 1594323, 4782969, 14348907, 43046721, 129140163, 387420489, 1162261467, 3486784401, ...So, let's see where the terms of {b_n} start to be larger than the corresponding {a_n} terms.Looking at the first few terms:a_1=1, b_1=3: 1 < 3a_2=5, b_2=9: 5 < 9a_3=9, b_3=27: 9 < 27a_4=13, b_4=81: 13 < 81a_5=17, b_5=243: 17 < 243a_6=21, b_6=729: 21 < 729a_7=25, b_7=2187: 25 < 2187a_8=29, b_8=6561: 29 < 6561a_9=33, b_9=19683: 33 < 19683a_10=37, b_10=59049: 37 < 59049a_11=41, b_11=177147: 41 < 177147a_12=45, b_12=531441: 45 < 531441a_13=49, b_13=1594323: 49 < 1594323a_14=53, b_14=4782969: 53 < 4782969a_15=57, b_15=14348907: 57 < 14348907a_16=61, b_16=43046721: 61 < 43046721a_17=65, b_17=129140163: 65 < 129140163a_18=69, b_18=387420489: 69 < 387420489a_19=73, b_19=1162261467: 73 < 1162261467a_20=77, b_20=3486784401: 77 < 3486784401So, up to n=20, all terms of {a_n} are less than the corresponding terms of {b_n}. But actually, the terms of {b_n} are much larger. So, in the combined sequence {c_n}, the terms of {b_n} will be interspersed among the terms of {a_n}.But wait, actually, the terms of {b_n} are 3,9,27,81,243,729,... So, let's see how they interleave with {a_n}.Let me list the terms of {a_n} and {b_n} in order:From {a_n}: 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,81,85,...From {b_n}: 3,9,27,81,243,729,...So, let's merge these two sequences, removing duplicates and arranging in ascending order.Let me try to list the merged sequence {c_n} step by step.Start with the smallest term: 1 (from {a_n})Next, 3 (from {b_n})Then, 5 (from {a_n})Next, 9 (from both {a_n} and {b_n}; since it's a set, we only include it once)Then, 13 (from {a_n})Next, 17 (from {a_n})Then, 21 (from {a_n})Next, 25 (from {a_n})Then, 27 (from {b_n})Next, 29 (from {a_n})Then, 33 (from {a_n})Next, 37 (from {a_n})Then, 41 (from {a_n})Next, 45 (from {a_n})Then, 49 (from {a_n})Next, 53 (from {a_n})Then, 57 (from {a_n})Next, 61 (from {a_n})Then, 65 (from {a_n})Next, 69 (from {a_n})Then, 73 (from {a_n})Next, 77 (from {a_n})Then, 81 (from both {a_n} and {b_n}; include once)Next, 85 (from {a_n})Then, 89 (from {a_n})Next, 93 (from {a_n})Then, 97 (from {a_n})Next, 101 (from {a_n})Then, 105 (from {a_n})Next, 109 (from {a_n})Then, 113 (from {a_n})Next, 117 (from {a_n})Then, 121 (from {a_n})Next, 125 (from {a_n})Then, 129 (from {a_n})Next, 133 (from {a_n})Then, 137 (from {a_n})Next, 141 (from {a_n})Then, 145 (from {a_n})Next, 149 (from {a_n})Then, 153 (from {a_n})Next, 157 (from {a_n})Then, 161 (from {a_n})Next, 165 (from {a_n})Then, 169 (from {a_n})Next, 173 (from {a_n})Then, 177 (from {a_n})Next, 181 (from {a_n})Then, 185 (from {a_n})Next, 189 (from {a_n})Then, 193 (from {a_n})Next, 197 (from {a_n})Then, 201 (from {a_n})Next, 205 (from {a_n})Then, 209 (from {a_n})Next, 213 (from {a_n})Then, 217 (from {a_n})Next, 221 (from {a_n})Then, 225 (from {a_n})Next, 229 (from {a_n})Then, 233 (from {a_n})Next, 237 (from {a_n})Then, 241 (from {a_n})Next, 243 (from {b_n})Then, 245 (from {a_n})Next, 249 (from {a_n})Then, 253 (from {a_n})Next, 257 (from {a_n})Then, 261 (from {a_n})Next, 265 (from {a_n})Then, 269 (from {a_n})Next, 273 (from {a_n})Then, 277 (from {a_n})Next, 281 (from {a_n})Then, 285 (from {a_n})Next, 289 (from {a_n})Then, 293 (from {a_n})Next, 297 (from {a_n})Then, 301 (from {a_n})Next, 305 (from {a_n})Then, 309 (from {a_n})Next, 313 (from {a_n})Then, 317 (from {a_n})Next, 321 (from {a_n})Then, 325 (from {a_n})Next, 329 (from {a_n})Then, 333 (from {a_n})Next, 337 (from {a_n})Then, 341 (from {a_n})Next, 345 (from {a_n})Then, 349 (from {a_n})Next, 353 (from {a_n})Then, 357 (from {a_n})Next, 361 (from {a_n})Then, 365 (from {a_n})Next, 369 (from {a_n})Then, 373 (from {a_n})Next, 377 (from {a_n})Then, 381 (from {a_n})Next, 385 (from {a_n})Then, 389 (from {a_n})Next, 393 (from {a_n})Then, 397 (from {a_n})Next, 401 (from {a_n})Then, 405 (from {a_n})Next, 409 (from {a_n})Then, 413 (from {a_n})Next, 417 (from {a_n})Then, 421 (from {a_n})Next, 425 (from {a_n})Then, 429 (from {a_n})Next, 433 (from {a_n})Then, 437 (from {a_n})Next, 441 (from {a_n})Then, 445 (from {a_n})Next, 449 (from {a_n})Then, 453 (from {a_n})Next, 457 (from {a_n})Then, 461 (from {a_n})Next, 465 (from {a_n})Then, 469 (from {a_n})Next, 473 (from {a_n})Then, 477 (from {a_n})Next, 481 (from {a_n})Then, 485 (from {a_n})Next, 489 (from {a_n})Then, 493 (from {a_n})Next, 497 (from {a_n})Then, 501 (from {a_n})Next, 505 (from {a_n})Then, 509 (from {a_n})Next, 513 (from {a_n})Then, 517 (from {a_n})Next, 521 (from {a_n})Then, 525 (from {a_n})Next, 529 (from {a_n})Then, 533 (from {a_n})Next, 537 (from {a_n})Then, 541 (from {a_n})Next, 545 (from {a_n})Then, 549 (from {a_n})Next, 553 (from {a_n})Then, 557 (from {a_n})Next, 561 (from {a_n})Then, 565 (from {a_n})Next, 569 (from {a_n})Then, 573 (from {a_n})Next, 577 (from {a_n})Then, 581 (from {a_n})Next, 585 (from {a_n})Then, 589 (from {a_n})Next, 593 (from {a_n})Then, 597 (from {a_n})Next, 601 (from {a_n})Then, 605 (from {a_n})Next, 609 (from {a_n})Then, 613 (from {a_n})Next, 617 (from {a_n})Then, 621 (from {a_n})Next, 625 (from {a_n})Then, 629 (from {a_n})Next, 633 (from {a_n})Then, 637 (from {a_n})Next, 641 (from {a_n})Then, 645 (from {a_n})Next, 649 (from {a_n})Then, 653 (from {a_n})Next, 657 (from {a_n})Then, 661 (from {a_n})Next, 665 (from {a_n})Then, 669 (from {a_n})Next, 673 (from {a_n})Then, 677 (from {a_n})Next, 681 (from {a_n})Then, 685 (from {a_n})Next, 689 (from {a_n})Then, 693 (from {a_n})Next, 697 (from {a_n})Then, 701 (from {a_n})Next, 705 (from {a_n})Then, 709 (from {a_n})Next, 713 (from {a_n})Then, 717 (from {a_n})Next, 721 (from {a_n})Then, 725 (from {a_n})Next, 729 (from {b_n})Then, 733 (from {a_n})And so on.Wait, but this is getting tedious. Maybe there's a better way.Alternatively, since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4, and {b_n} is a geometric sequence with ratio 3, we can note that the terms of {b_n} are 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, etc.So, let's list the terms of {b_n} and see where they fit into the {a_n} sequence.First, list the terms of {b_n}:b_1 = 3b_2 = 9b_3 = 27b_4 = 81b_5 = 243b_6 = 729b_7 = 2187b_8 = 6561And so on.Now, let's see where each b_n falls in the {a_n} sequence.For b_1 = 3: In {a_n}, the terms are 1,5,9,13,... So, 3 is between a_1=1 and a_2=5. So, in the merged sequence, 3 comes after 1 and before 5.Similarly, b_2=9: In {a_n}, a_3=9. So, 9 is already in {a_n}, so we don't need to include it again.b_3=27: In {a_n}, let's find where 27 would fit. The terms of {a_n} are 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,... So, 27 is between a_7=25 and a_8=29. So, 27 would be inserted after 25 and before 29.b_4=81: In {a_n}, let's see. The terms near 81 are a_20=77, a_21=81. So, 81 is equal to a_21, so we don't need to include it again.b_5=243: In {a_n}, let's see. The terms near 243: a_n = 4n - 3. So, solving 4n - 3 = 243: 4n = 246 => n=61.5. So, a_61=4*61 -3=244-3=241, a_62=245. So, 243 is between a_61=241 and a_62=245. So, 243 would be inserted after 241 and before 245.b_6=729: Similarly, solving 4n -3=729: 4n=732 => n=183. So, a_183=729. So, 729 is already in {a_n}, so we don't need to include it again.b_7=2187: Let's find where 2187 falls in {a_n}. 4n -3=2187 => 4n=2190 => n=547.5. So, a_547=4*547 -3=2188 -3=2185, a_548=2189. So, 2187 is between a_547 and a_548.b_8=6561: Similarly, 4n -3=6561 => 4n=6564 => n=1641. So, a_1641=6561. So, 6561 is already in {a_n}.Wait, so the terms of {b_n} that are not already in {a_n} are b_1=3, b_3=27, b_5=243, b_7=2187, etc. The even-indexed terms of {b_n} (b_2, b_4, b_6, b_8,...) are equal to terms in {a_n} because 9= a_3, 81=a_21, 729=a_183, 6561=a_1641, etc.Therefore, in the merged sequence {c_n}, we need to include all terms from {a_n} and the terms from {b_n} that are not already in {a_n}, which are b_1=3, b_3=27, b_5=243, b_7=2187, etc.So, the merged sequence {c_n} will consist of all terms from {a_n} plus the terms from {b_n} at odd indices (b_1, b_3, b_5, b_7,...). These terms from {b_n} will be inserted into the sequence {a_n} at their respective positions.Therefore, to form {c_n}, we can think of it as the union of {a_n} and {b_n} with duplicates removed, sorted in ascending order.Given that, to compute T_{20} = c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_{20}, we need to list the first 20 terms of {c_n}.So, let's try to list the first 20 terms of {c_n}.Starting from the smallest:1 (from {a_n})3 (from {b_n})5 (from {a_n})9 (from {a_n})13 (from {a_n})17 (from {a_n})21 (from {a_n})25 (from {a_n})27 (from {b_n})29 (from {a_n})33 (from {a_n})37 (from {a_n})41 (from {a_n})45 (from {a_n})49 (from {a_n})53 (from {a_n})57 (from {a_n})61 (from {a_n})65 (from {a_n})69 (from {a_n})Wait, that's 20 terms. Let me count:1. 12. 33. 54. 95. 136. 177. 218. 259. 2710. 2911. 3312. 3713. 4114. 4515. 4916. 5317. 5718. 6119. 6520. 69Wait, so the 20th term is 69.But let me verify that. Let's list them step by step:1: 12: 33: 54: 95: 136: 177: 218: 259: 2710: 2911: 3312: 3713: 4114: 4515: 4916: 5317: 5718: 6119: 6520: 69Yes, that's correct. So, the first 20 terms of {c_n} are as above.Now, to compute T_{20}, we need to sum these 20 terms.Let me list them again:1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 27, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69.Let me add them step by step.Alternatively, perhaps we can group them or find a pattern to make the addition easier.But since there are only 20 terms, it's manageable.Let me write them down and add sequentially:1 + 3 = 44 + 5 = 99 + 9 = 1818 + 13 = 3131 + 17 = 4848 + 21 = 6969 + 25 = 9494 + 27 = 121121 + 29 = 150150 + 33 = 183183 + 37 = 220220 + 41 = 261261 + 45 = 306306 + 49 = 355355 + 53 = 408408 + 57 = 465465 + 61 = 526526 + 65 = 591591 + 69 = 660So, the total sum T_{20} is 660.Wait, let me verify the addition step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with 1:11 + 3 = 44 + 5 = 99 + 9 = 1818 + 13 = 3131 + 17 = 4848 + 21 = 6969 + 25 = 9494 + 27 = 121121 + 29 = 150150 + 33 = 183183 + 37 = 220220 + 41 = 261261 + 45 = 306306 + 49 = 355355 + 53 = 408408 + 57 = 465465 + 61 = 526526 + 65 = 591591 + 69 = 660Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, perhaps we can find a formula or a smarter way to compute the sum without adding each term individually.Looking at the terms, we can note that most of them are from {a_n}, except for the terms 3, 27, 243, etc., which are from {b_n}.But in the first 20 terms of {c_n}, only 3 and 27 are from {b_n}. The next term from {b_n} would be 243, which is much larger and would appear much later in the sequence.So, in the first 20 terms, we have two terms from {b_n}: 3 and 27.Therefore, the sum T_{20} can be computed as the sum of the first 20 terms of {a_n} plus the sum of the terms from {b_n} that are included in the first 20 terms of {c_n}.But wait, actually, the first 20 terms of {c_n} include some terms from {a_n} and some from {b_n}. Specifically, in the first 20 terms, we have two terms from {b_n}: 3 and 27.Therefore, the sum T_{20} is equal to the sum of the first 18 terms of {a_n} plus the two terms 3 and 27.Wait, let me see:In the first 20 terms of {c_n}, how many terms are from {a_n} and how many are from {b_n}?Looking back at the list:1 (a), 3 (b), 5 (a), 9 (a), 13 (a), 17 (a), 21 (a), 25 (a), 27 (b), 29 (a), 33 (a), 37 (a), 41 (a), 45 (a), 49 (a), 53 (a), 57 (a), 61 (a), 65 (a), 69 (a).So, out of 20 terms, 2 are from {b_n} (3 and 27), and 18 are from {a_n}.Therefore, T_{20} = sum of first 18 terms of {a_n} + 3 + 27.Wait, but let me check: the first 20 terms of {c_n} include 18 terms from {a_n} and 2 terms from {b_n}. So, yes, T_{20} = sum_{k=1}^{18} a_k + 3 + 27.But let's confirm the indices. The terms from {a_n} in the first 20 terms of {c_n} are:1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69.That's 18 terms.So, sum of these 18 terms plus 3 and 27.Alternatively, we can compute the sum of the first 18 terms of {a_n} and then add 3 and 27.The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d).For {a_n}, a_1=1, d=4.So, S_{18} = 18/2 * (2*1 + (18-1)*4) = 9*(2 + 68) = 9*70 = 630.Then, adding the two terms from {b_n}: 3 + 27 = 30.Therefore, T_{20} = 630 + 30 = 660.Which matches the earlier result.Therefore, T_{20} = 660.So, summarizing:(1) The general formulas are:a_n = 4n - 3b_n = 3^n(2) T_{20} = 660**Final Answer**(1) The general formulas are boxed{a_n = 4n - 3} and boxed{b_n = 3^n}.  (2) The sum T_{20} is boxed{660}."},{"question":"The sum of the first 3 terms of an arithmetic sequence is 12, and the fourth term is 0.

Hmm, zeros mean where the function crosses the x-axis, right? So, I need to figure out how many times f(x) equals zero between 0 and 1.First, maybe I should check the values of f(x) at the endpoints of the interval to see if the function crosses zero somewhere in between. Let me compute f(0) and f(1).Calculating f(0): 2^0 is 1, 0^3 is 0, so f(0) = 1 + 0 - 2 = -1. Okay, so f(0) is -1.Calculating f(1): 2^1 is 2, 1^3 is 1, so f(1) = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1. So, f(1) is 1.Alright, so f(0) is negative and f(1) is positive. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since f is continuous (because it's made up of continuous functions: exponential and polynomial), there must be at least one zero between 0 and 1.But the question is asking for the number of zeros. So, is there just one zero, or could there be more?To figure this out, maybe I should analyze the behavior of the function in the interval (0,1). Let's look at the derivative of f(x) to see if it's increasing or decreasing.The derivative f'(x) is the derivative of 2^x plus the derivative of x^3 minus the derivative of 2. The derivative of 2^x is ln(2)*2^x, the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2, and the derivative of 2 is 0. So, f'(x) = ln(2)*2^x + 3x^2.Hmm, both terms ln(2)*2^x and 3x^2 are positive for all x in (0,1). Because ln(2) is a positive constant (approximately 0.693), 2^x is always positive, and 3x^2 is also positive since x is between 0 and 1. So, f'(x) is always positive in (0,1). That means the function is strictly increasing on this interval.If the function is strictly increasing, it can cross the x-axis at most once. Since we already know it goes from negative at x=0 to positive at x=1, it must cross the x-axis exactly once in the interval (0,1). So, there's only one zero.Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I can test some values in between to see how the function behaves.Let's try x=0.5. f(0.5) = 2^0.5 + (0.5)^3 - 2. 2^0.5 is sqrt(2) which is approximately 1.414, (0.5)^3 is 0.125, so f(0.5) ≈ 1.414 + 0.125 - 2 ≈ 1.539 - 2 ≈ -0.461. So, f(0.5) is still negative.Okay, so between 0 and 0.5, the function goes from -1 to -0.461. Still negative. Let's try x=0.75.f(0.75) = 2^0.75 + (0.75)^3 - 2. 2^0.75 is 2^(3/4) which is sqrt(2^3) = sqrt(8) ≈ 2.828, but wait, no, that's 2^(3/2). Wait, 2^0.75 is actually 2^(3/4) which is approximately e^( (3/4)*ln2 ) ≈ e^(0.519) ≈ 1.681. Let me check that again.Wait, 2^0.75 is equal to (2^(1/4))^3, which is approximately (1.189)^3 ≈ 1.681. Yeah, that's correct. So, 2^0.75 ≈ 1.681.(0.75)^3 is 0.421875. So, f(0.75) ≈ 1.681 + 0.421875 - 2 ≈ 2.102875 - 2 ≈ 0.102875. So, f(0.75) is approximately 0.103, which is positive.So, at x=0.75, the function is positive, and at x=0.5, it's negative. So, the zero must be between 0.5 and 0.75.Wait, but since the function is strictly increasing, it can only cross zero once. So, even though it's negative at 0.5 and positive at 0.75, it's still only one crossing.Let me try another point, say x=0.6.f(0.6) = 2^0.6 + (0.6)^3 - 2. 2^0.6 is approximately e^(0.6*ln2) ≈ e^(0.4155) ≈ 1.5157. (0.6)^3 is 0.216. So, f(0.6) ≈ 1.5157 + 0.216 - 2 ≈ 1.7317 - 2 ≈ -0.2683. So, still negative.x=0.7: 2^0.7 ≈ e^(0.7*0.693) ≈ e^(0.4851) ≈ 1.6255. (0.7)^3 = 0.343. So, f(0.7) ≈ 1.6255 + 0.343 - 2 ≈ 1.9685 - 2 ≈ -0.0315. Hmm, still negative, but very close to zero.x=0.72: 2^0.72 ≈ e^(0.72*0.693) ≈ e^(0.499) ≈ 1.646. (0.72)^3 ≈ 0.373. So, f(0.72) ≈ 1.646 + 0.373 - 2 ≈ 2.019 - 2 ≈ 0.019. So, positive.So, between x=0.7 and x=0.72, the function goes from negative to positive. So, the zero is somewhere around there.But regardless of where exactly it is, since the function is strictly increasing, it can only cross zero once. So, only one zero in the interval.Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can check the second derivative to see if the function is concave up or down, but I don't think that affects the number of zeros. The first derivative tells us it's increasing, so regardless of concavity, it can only cross once.Alternatively, maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem or Rolle's Theorem, but I don't think that's necessary here. Since the function is strictly increasing, it can't have more than one zero.Therefore, the number of zeros in (0,1) is 1.**Final Answer**The number of zeros of the function in the interval (0, 1) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Out of 1200 people polled, 30% do not like radio, and 10% of the people who do not like radio also do not like music.  How many people polled do not like both radio and music?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: Out of 1200 people polled, 30% do not like radio, and 10% of the people who do not like radio also do not like music. I need to find out how many people polled do not like both radio and music. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.First, let's figure out how many people do not like radio. The total number of people polled is 1200, and 30% of them don't like radio. To find 30% of 1200, I can calculate that as follows:30% of 1200 = 0.30 * 1200Let me compute that. 0.30 times 1200... 0.3 times 1000 is 300, and 0.3 times 200 is 60, so 300 + 60 is 360. So, 360 people do not like radio.Now, the next part says that 10% of the people who do not like radio also do not like music. So, this is 10% of the 360 people who don't like radio. I need to calculate 10% of 360.10% of 360 = 0.10 * 360Calculating that: 0.1 times 300 is 30, and 0.1 times 60 is 6, so 30 + 6 is 36. So, 36 people do not like both radio and music.Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem says 10% of the people who do not like radio also do not like music. So, that means among the 360 people who don't like radio, 10% of them have an additional dislike for music. So, yes, that would be 36 people. So, these 36 people are the ones who don't like both radio and music.Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using sets or Venn diagrams? Let me consider that.Let me denote:- Total people, T = 1200- People who do not like radio, R' = 30% of T = 360- People who do not like both radio and music, (R ∩ M)' = 10% of R' = 36So, yes, that seems consistent. So, the number of people who don't like both is 36.Just to double-check, let me think about the percentages again. 30% of 1200 is 360, which is straightforward. Then, 10% of 360 is 36. So, 36 people don't like both. That seems right.I don't think I need to consider anything else here because the problem is pretty straightforward. It's not asking for the number of people who like neither or anything more complicated. It's just a two-step percentage calculation.So, to recap:1. Calculate 30% of 1200 to find the number of people who don't like radio: 360.2. Calculate 10% of 360 to find how many of those also don't like music: 36.Therefore, the number of people who don't like both radio and music is 36.**Final Answer**The number of people who do not like both radio and music is boxed{36}."},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: left(x+3right)^{2}+left(x+2right)left(x-2right)-xleft(x+6right), where x=sqrt{2}.","answer":"First, I will expand each term in the expression ((x + 3)^2 + (x + 2)(x - 2) - x(x + 6)).Expanding ((x + 3)^2) gives (x^2 + 6x + 9).Next, expanding ((x + 2)(x - 2)) results in (x^2 - 4).Then, expanding (x(x + 6)) yields (x^2 + 6x).Now, I will substitute these expanded forms back into the original expression:[(x + 3)^2 + (x + 2)(x - 2) - x(x + 6) = (x^2 + 6x + 9) + (x^2 - 4) - (x^2 + 6x)]Combining like terms:[x^2 + 6x + 9 + x^2 - 4 - x^2 - 6x = x^2 + 5]Finally, substituting (x = sqrt{2}) into the simplified expression:[(sqrt{2})^2 + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7]"},{"question":"An unusual bicycle has 20 spokes on the front wheel and twice as many spokes on the back wheel.

That is, n! + n = n^k. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:n! + n = n^kSo, I need to find positive integers n and k where this equation holds. Since both n! and n^k are involved, I know that factorials grow very quickly, much faster than exponential functions, but it depends on the base and the exponent. So, maybe for small values of n, this equation can hold, but for larger n, n! will dominate, making the equation impossible.Let me start by testing small values of n and see if I can find any solutions.Starting with n = 1:Left side: 1! + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2Right side: 1^k = 1 for any k, since 1 raised to any power is 1.So, 2 ≠ 1. Therefore, n = 1 is not a solution.Next, n = 2:Left side: 2! + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4Right side: 2^kWe need 2^k = 4. So, 2^2 = 4, which means k = 2.So, (2, 2) is a solution.Moving on to n = 3:Left side: 3! + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9Right side: 3^kWe need 3^k = 9. 3^2 = 9, so k = 2 again.Thus, (3, 2) is another solution.Now, n = 4:Left side: 4! + 4 = 24 + 4 = 28Right side: 4^kWe need 4^k = 28. Let's see what 4^k gives us:4^1 = 44^2 = 164^3 = 6428 is between 16 and 64, so there's no integer k such that 4^k = 28. Therefore, n = 4 is not a solution.Next, n = 5:Left side: 5! + 5 = 120 + 5 = 125Right side: 5^kWe need 5^k = 125. 5^3 = 125, so k = 3.Therefore, (5, 3) is a solution.Moving on to n = 6:Left side: 6! + 6 = 720 + 6 = 726Right side: 6^kWe need 6^k = 726. Let's compute some powers of 6:6^1 = 66^2 = 366^3 = 2166^4 = 1296726 is between 216 and 1296, so let's check 6^3 = 216, 6^4 = 1296. 726 is not a power of 6, so no integer k satisfies this. Thus, n = 6 is not a solution.n = 7:Left side: 7! + 7 = 5040 + 7 = 5047Right side: 7^kWe need 7^k = 5047. Let's compute powers of 7:7^1 = 77^2 = 497^3 = 3437^4 = 24017^5 = 168075047 is between 2401 and 16807. Let me check 7^4 = 2401, 7^5 is way too big. 5047 divided by 7^4 is 5047 / 2401 ≈ 2.1, which is not an integer. So, 5047 is not a power of 7. Therefore, n = 7 is not a solution.n = 8:Left side: 8! + 8 = 40320 + 8 = 40328Right side: 8^kCompute powers of 8:8^1 = 88^2 = 648^3 = 5128^4 = 40968^5 = 327688^6 = 26214440328 is between 8^5 = 32768 and 8^6 = 262144. Let's see if 40328 is a power of 8. 8^5 is 32768, 8^6 is too big. 40328 - 32768 = 7560, which is not a multiple of 8. So, 40328 is not a power of 8. Therefore, n = 8 is not a solution.n = 9:Left side: 9! + 9 = 362880 + 9 = 362889Right side: 9^kCompute powers of 9:9^1 = 99^2 = 819^3 = 7299^4 = 65619^5 = 590499^6 = 531441362889 is between 9^5 = 59049 and 9^6 = 531441. Let's see if 362889 is a power of 9. 9^5 is 59049, 9^6 is 531441. 362889 divided by 9^5 is 362889 / 59049 ≈ 6.14, which is not an integer. So, 362889 is not a power of 9. Therefore, n = 9 is not a solution.n = 10:Left side: 10! + 10 = 3628800 + 10 = 3628810Right side: 10^kCompute powers of 10:10^1 = 1010^2 = 10010^3 = 100010^4 = 1000010^5 = 10000010^6 = 100000010^7 = 100000003628810 is between 10^6 and 10^7. Let's see if 3628810 is a power of 10. 10^6 is 1,000,000, 10^7 is 10,000,000. 3,628,810 is not a power of 10 because it doesn't end with the right number of zeros. So, n = 10 is not a solution.So far, the solutions we have are (2, 2), (3, 2), and (5, 3). Let me check n = 4 again just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.n = 4:Left side: 24 + 4 = 28Right side: 4^k4^3 = 64, which is too big, and 4^2 = 16, which is too small. So, 28 isn't a power of 4. Correct.n = 1: 2 ≠ 1^k, so no solution.n = 2: 4 = 2^2, so k=2.n = 3: 9 = 3^2, so k=2.n = 4: 28 isn't a power of 4.n = 5: 125 = 5^3, so k=3.n = 6: 726 isn't a power of 6.n = 7: 5047 isn't a power of 7.n = 8: 40328 isn't a power of 8.n = 9: 362889 isn't a power of 9.n = 10: 3628810 isn't a power of 10.I think it's time to consider whether there are any larger n that could satisfy this equation. Since factorials grow much faster than exponentials, it's unlikely, but let me try to see if I can find a general approach or some inequality to bound n.So, the equation is n! + n = n^k.Let me rearrange it:n! = n^k - nFactor n on the right side:n! = n(n^{k-1} - 1)So, n! is equal to n multiplied by (n^{k-1} - 1). Since n! is divisible by n, that makes sense.Let me divide both sides by n:(n-1)! = n^{k-1} - 1So, (n-1)! + 1 = n^{k-1}Hmm, interesting. So, (n-1)! + 1 is equal to a power of n. This seems similar to Wilson's theorem, which states that if p is a prime, then (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p. So, (p-1)! + 1 is divisible by p.In our case, (n-1)! + 1 = n^{k-1}, which is a power of n. So, if n is prime, then by Wilson's theorem, (n-1)! + 1 is divisible by n, which is consistent because n^{k-1} is obviously divisible by n when k-1 ≥ 1, i.e., k ≥ 2.But if n is composite, then (n-1)! is divisible by n, so (n-1)! + 1 ≡ 1 mod n, which would mean that n^{k-1} ≡ 1 mod n. But n^{k-1} is 0 mod n unless k-1 = 0, which would make it 1. Wait, no. Let me think.Wait, n^{k-1} is congruent to 0 mod n for any k-1 ≥ 1, because n divides n^{k-1}. So, if n is composite, then (n-1)! + 1 ≡ 1 mod n, but n^{k-1} ≡ 0 mod n. Therefore, 1 ≡ 0 mod n, which is impossible unless n = 1, but n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. So, n=1, but we saw earlier that n=1 doesn't work because 1! +1 = 2 ≠ 1^k.Therefore, for composite n ≥ 4, the equation (n-1)! + 1 = n^{k-1} cannot hold because the left side is congruent to 1 mod n, and the right side is congruent to 0 mod n. Therefore, n must be prime.So, this reduces our problem to primes. So, n must be prime. Therefore, we only need to check prime numbers.So, let's list the primes we checked earlier: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.We already saw that n=2, 3, 5 are solutions. Let's check n=7 again.Wait, n=7: (7-1)! +1 = 720 +1 = 721. Is 721 equal to 7^{k-1}? Let's see:7^1 = 77^2 = 497^3 = 3437^4 = 2401721 is between 343 and 2401. 721 divided by 7 is 103, which is not a power of 7. So, 721 isn't a power of 7. Therefore, n=7 is not a solution.Wait, but n=7 is prime, but it doesn't satisfy the equation. So, maybe not all primes satisfy the equation. So, perhaps only some primes do.Similarly, let's check n=11:(n-1)! +1 = 10! +1 = 3628800 +1 = 3628801Is 3628801 equal to 11^{k-1}?Compute powers of 11:11^1 = 1111^2 = 12111^3 = 133111^4 = 1464111^5 = 16105111^6 = 177156111^7 = 194871713628801 is between 11^6 = 1771561 and 11^7 = 19487171. Let's check if 3628801 is a power of 11.Divide 3628801 by 11^6: 3628801 / 1771561 ≈ 2.048. Not an integer. So, 3628801 is not a power of 11. Therefore, n=11 is not a solution.Similarly, n=13:(n-1)! +1 = 12! +1 = 479001600 +1 = 479001601Is this equal to 13^{k-1}?Compute powers of 13:13^1 = 1313^2 = 16913^3 = 219713^4 = 2856113^5 = 37129313^6 = 482680913^7 = 6274851713^8 = 815730721479001601 is between 13^7 and 13^8. Let's see:13^7 = 6274851713^8 = 815730721479001601 is less than 13^8. Let me divide 479001601 by 13^7:479001601 / 62748517 ≈ 7.63. Not an integer. So, 479001601 isn't a power of 13. Therefore, n=13 is not a solution.So, n=2, 3, 5 are primes where the equation holds, but n=7, 11, 13 don't. So, maybe only certain small primes satisfy the equation.Let me check n=7 again. Wait, (7-1)! +1 = 720 +1 = 721. 721 divided by 7 is 103, which is prime, so 721 = 7 × 103. So, 721 isn't a power of 7, as 7^3 = 343, 7^4 = 2401. So, yeah, not a power.Similarly, n=5: (5-1)! +1 = 24 +1 =25 =5^2. So, that's why n=5 works.n=3: (3-1)! +1 = 2 +1 =3 =3^1, but wait, in our equation, (n-1)! +1 =n^{k-1}, so for n=3, 3 =3^{k-1}, so k-1=1, so k=2. That's correct.Similarly, n=2: (2-1)! +1 =1 +1=2=2^{k-1}, so 2=2^{k-1}, so k-1=1, so k=2. Correct.So, seems like for primes n, (n-1)! +1 is equal to n^{k-1}, which is a power of n. For n=2,3,5, this holds, but for larger primes, it doesn't.Is there a mathematical reason why this only happens for n=2,3,5?Well, for n=2: 1! +1=2=2^1, so k=2.n=3: 2! +1=3=3^1, so k=2.n=5: 4! +1=25=5^2, so k=3.Wait, so for n=5, it's 5 squared, not 5 to the first power. So, perhaps the exponent k-1 is 2 in that case.So, is there a pattern here? Let me see:For n=2, k=2.For n=3, k=2.For n=5, k=3.Hmm, not an obvious pattern, but perhaps n=2,3,5 are special primes where (n-1)! +1 is a perfect power of n.I wonder if there's a known theorem or conjecture about this.Wait, I recall that Wilson's theorem says that if p is prime, then (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p. So, (p-1)! +1 is divisible by p. So, in our case, (n-1)! +1 is equal to n^{k-1}, which is a power of n, so n divides (n-1)! +1, which is consistent with Wilson's theorem.But beyond that, it's not clear. So, perhaps only for certain primes, (n-1)! +1 is a perfect power of n.I think that for n=2,3,5, we have (n-1)! +1 = n^{k-1}, which gives us the solutions we found.For n=7, as we saw, (7-1)! +1=721, which is 7×103, not a power of 7.Similarly, for n=11, (11-1)! +1=3628801, which is not a power of 11.So, perhaps only n=2,3,5 satisfy this condition.To confirm, let me check n=7 again:6! +1=720 +1=721. 721 divided by 7 is 103, which is prime. So, 721=7×103, which isn't a power of 7. So, no.n=11:10! +1=3628800 +1=3628801. Let me see if this is a power of 11.Compute 11^6=1771561, 11^7=19487171. 3628801 is between these two. 3628801 divided by 11^6 is approximately 2.048, which isn't an integer. So, not a power.Similarly, n=13:12! +1=479001600 +1=479001601. Let me check if this is a power of 13.13^7=62748517, 13^8=815730721. 479001601 is between them. 479001601 divided by 13^7 is approximately 7.63, not an integer. So, not a power.So, seems like only n=2,3,5 satisfy the equation.Therefore, the solutions are (2,2), (3,2), and (5,3).Wait, let me check n=1 again, just to be thorough.n=1:Left side:1! +1=2Right side:1^k=12≠1, so no solution.n=4 is composite, and we saw that 28 isn't a power of 4.n=6 is composite, 726 isn't a power of 6.n=7 is prime, but doesn't work.n=8 is composite, doesn't work.n=9 is composite, doesn't work.n=10 is composite, doesn't work.n=11 is prime, doesn't work.n=12 is composite, doesn't work.n=13 is prime, doesn't work.So, yeah, it seems like only n=2,3,5 are the primes where (n-1)! +1 is a power of n, leading to the solutions (2,2), (3,2), and (5,3).Therefore, the pairs are (2,2), (3,2), and (5,3).**Final Answer**The pairs of positive integers ((n, k)) that satisfy the equation are (boxed{(2, 2)}), (boxed{(3, 2)}), and (boxed{(5, 3)})."},{"question":"If the graph of the function y=f(x) is symmetric to the graph of y=2^{x-2} about the line y=x, then f(8)= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: If the graph of the function y = f(x) is symmetric to the graph of y = 2^{x-2} about the line y = x, then f(8) = ______. Hmm, I need to figure out what f(8) is. Let me think about what it means for two graphs to be symmetric about the line y = x.I remember that if two graphs are symmetric about the line y = x, they are reflections of each other over that line. And reflection over y = x usually means that they are inverse functions of each other. So, if y = f(x) is symmetric to y = 2^{x-2} about y = x, then f(x) must be the inverse function of 2^{x-2}. That makes sense because inverse functions are reflections over the line y = x.So, if f(x) is the inverse of 2^{x-2}, then to find f(8), I need to find the inverse function of 2^{x-2} and then plug in 8 into that inverse function. Let me recall how to find the inverse of a function.To find the inverse, I can start by letting y = 2^{x-2}. Then, to find the inverse, I need to solve for x in terms of y. So, let's write that down:y = 2^{x - 2}I need to solve for x. Hmm, since this is an exponential function, I can use logarithms to solve for x. Remember, taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides will help me get x down from the exponent.So, taking log base 2 of both sides:log₂(y) = log₂(2^{x - 2})Simplify the right side:log₂(y) = x - 2Now, solve for x:x = log₂(y) + 2So, the inverse function is x = log₂(y) + 2. But in function notation, we usually write it as f^{-1}(y) = log₂(y) + 2, but since f(x) is the inverse, then f(x) = log₂(x) + 2. Wait, let me make sure.Actually, if the original function is y = 2^{x - 2}, then its inverse is y = log₂(x) + 2. So, f(x) is the inverse, which is y = log₂(x) + 2. Therefore, f(x) = log₂(x) + 2.So, now, to find f(8), I just plug in 8 into this function:f(8) = log₂(8) + 2I know that log₂(8) is 3 because 2^3 = 8. So,f(8) = 3 + 2 = 5Therefore, f(8) is 5.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with y = 2^{x - 2}, I swapped x and y to find the inverse, so x = 2^{y - 2}, then took log₂ of both sides: log₂(x) = y - 2, so y = log₂(x) + 2. Yeah, that seems right. So, f(x) is log₂(x) + 2, so f(8) is 3 + 2 = 5. That seems correct.Alternatively, I can think about the reflection over y = x. If (a, b) is a point on y = 2^{x - 2}, then (b, a) should be a point on y = f(x). So, if I can find a point on y = 2^{x - 2} where the y-coordinate is 8, then the corresponding x-coordinate will be f(8).Let me try that approach. Let's set y = 8 in the original function:8 = 2^{x - 2}Solving for x:2^{x - 2} = 8Since 8 is 2^3, we can write:2^{x - 2} = 2^3Therefore, x - 2 = 3, so x = 5.So, the point (5, 8) is on y = 2^{x - 2}. Therefore, reflecting over y = x, the point (8, 5) should be on y = f(x). So, f(8) = 5. That confirms my earlier result.Just to make sure, let me recap:1. If two functions are symmetric about y = x, they are inverses of each other.2. The given function is y = 2^{x - 2}; its inverse is y = log₂(x) + 2.3. Therefore, f(x) = log₂(x) + 2.4. Plugging in x = 8: f(8) = log₂(8) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.5. Alternatively, finding the point (5, 8) on the original function leads to (8, 5) on f(x), so f(8) = 5.Both methods give the same answer, so I feel confident that f(8) is indeed 5.**Final Answer**The value of ( f(8) ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"It is known that for any integer ( K neq 27 ), the number ( a - K^{3} ) is divisible by ( 27 - K ). Find ( a ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: For any integer ( K neq 27 ), the number ( a - K^{3} ) is divisible by ( 27 - K ). I need to find ( a ). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me parse the problem. It says that ( a - K^3 ) is divisible by ( 27 - K ) for any integer ( K ) not equal to 27. So, in mathematical terms, that means ( 27 - K ) divides ( a - K^3 ). Another way to say that is ( a - K^3 ) is a multiple of ( 27 - K ). So, ( a - K^3 = (27 - K) times m ) for some integer ( m ). But since this has to hold for any integer ( K neq 27 ), maybe I can think of this as a polynomial identity.Wait, if it's true for any integer ( K ), then perhaps ( a - K^3 ) is divisible by ( 27 - K ) as polynomials. That is, if I consider ( a - K^3 ) as a polynomial in ( K ), then ( 27 - K ) is a factor of that polynomial. So, by the factor theorem, if ( 27 - K ) is a factor, then substituting ( K = 27 ) into the polynomial should give zero. But wait, when ( K = 27 ), the divisor becomes zero, which is undefined, but maybe the limit as ( K ) approaches 27 is zero? Hmm, not sure if that's the right direction.Alternatively, maybe I can express ( a - K^3 ) as ( (27 - K) times Q(K) ), where ( Q(K) ) is some polynomial in ( K ). Since this must hold for all ( K neq 27 ), then perhaps ( Q(K) ) is a polynomial that can be determined.Let me think about polynomial division. If ( 27 - K ) divides ( a - K^3 ), then ( a - K^3 ) must be equal to ( (27 - K) times Q(K) ) for some polynomial ( Q(K) ). Let me try to perform the division of ( a - K^3 ) by ( 27 - K ).Alternatively, maybe I can factor ( K^3 - a ) as ( (K - 27) times Q(K) ). Wait, but the problem says ( a - K^3 ) is divisible by ( 27 - K ), which is the same as ( -(K - 27) ). So, ( a - K^3 = -(K - 27) times Q(K) ). So, ( K^3 - a = (K - 27) times Q(K) ).So, if I can factor ( K^3 - a ) as ( (K - 27) times Q(K) ), then ( Q(K) ) must be a quadratic polynomial because ( K^3 - a ) is a cubic and ( K - 27 ) is linear. So, let me write ( K^3 - a = (K - 27)(AK^2 + BK + C) ), where ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are constants to be determined.Expanding the right-hand side: ( (K - 27)(AK^2 + BK + C) = AK^3 + BK^2 + CK - 27AK^2 - 27BK - 27C ). Combine like terms:- ( AK^3 )- ( (B - 27A)K^2 )- ( (C - 27B)K )- ( -27C )So, the expanded form is ( AK^3 + (B - 27A)K^2 + (C - 27B)K - 27C ).Now, set this equal to ( K^3 - a ). So, we have:1. Coefficient of ( K^3 ): ( A = 1 )2. Coefficient of ( K^2 ): ( B - 27A = 0 )3. Coefficient of ( K ): ( C - 27B = 0 )4. Constant term: ( -27C = -a )Let's solve these equations step by step.From equation 1: ( A = 1 ).From equation 2: ( B - 27A = 0 ) → ( B = 27A = 27 times 1 = 27 ).From equation 3: ( C - 27B = 0 ) → ( C = 27B = 27 times 27 = 729 ).From equation 4: ( -27C = -a ) → ( a = 27C = 27 times 729 ).Now, let's compute ( 27 times 729 ). Hmm, 27 times 700 is 18,900, and 27 times 29 is 783. So, 18,900 + 783 = 19,683. Therefore, ( a = 19,683 ).Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 27 times 700 is indeed 18,900. 27 times 29: 27*20=540, 27*9=243, so 540+243=783. So, 18,900 + 783 is 19,683. Yep, that seems right.Alternatively, since 27 is 3^3, and 729 is 9^3 or 27^2. So, 27*729 is 27^3, which is 19,683. That's another way to see it.So, putting it all together, ( a = 19,683 ).Let me verify this result to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If ( a = 19,683 ), then ( a - K^3 = 19,683 - K^3 ). We need to check if this is divisible by ( 27 - K ) for any integer ( K neq 27 ).Alternatively, since ( 19,683 = 27^3 ), so ( a - K^3 = 27^3 - K^3 ). We can factor this as ( (27 - K)(27^2 + 27K + K^2) ). So, indeed, ( 27 - K ) is a factor of ( 27^3 - K^3 ), which means ( a - K^3 ) is divisible by ( 27 - K ) for any integer ( K neq 27 ). That checks out.Therefore, the value of ( a ) must be 19,683.**Final Answer**The value of ( a ) is boxed{19683}."},{"question":"Blinky wants to make a three-layer birthday cake for her mom.

As a result, each color TV makes a profit of 270 yuan. What is the purchase price of each color TV?  Xiao Hong sets the purchase price of each color TV as x yuan and formulates the equation as: x times 40% times 80% = x - 270.  Do you think her equation is correct? If it is correct, find the value of x; if it is not, formulate a new equation and find the value of x.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a shopping mall that increases the purchase price of color TVs by 40% and then advertises a 20% discount. As a result, each TV makes a profit of 270 yuan. I need to figure out the purchase price of each TV. Xiao Hong set up the equation as x times 40% times 80% equals x minus 270. Hmm, let me think about whether that's correct. First, let me break down the problem step by step. The purchase price is x yuan. The mall increases this price by 40%, so the new price becomes x plus 40% of x, which is x * 1.4. Then, they offer a 20% discount on this increased price. A 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the increased price, so that would be 1.4x * 0.8. Xiao Hong's equation is x * 40% * 80% = x - 270. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me write it out properly. If the original price is x, increasing it by 40% gives 1.4x. Then, applying a 20% discount would be 1.4x * 0.8. So, the selling price after the discount is 1.4x * 0.8. Now, the profit is the selling price minus the purchase price. The problem states that this profit is 270 yuan. So, the equation should be:Selling Price - Purchase Price = Profit  1.4x * 0.8 - x = 270Let me compute 1.4 * 0.8 first. 1.4 times 0.8 is 1.12. So, the equation becomes:1.12x - x = 270  0.12x = 270Then, solving for x, we get:x = 270 / 0.12  x = 2250Wait, but Xiao Hong's equation was x * 40% * 80% = x - 270. Let me compute that:x * 0.4 * 0.8 = x - 270  0.32x = x - 270  0.32x - x = -270  -0.68x = -270  x = (-270)/(-0.68)  x ≈ 397.06Hmm, that's a different result. So, clearly, Xiao Hong's equation is not correct. Wait, why did she set it up that way? She took the purchase price, multiplied by 40% and then 80%, and set that equal to x - 270. But that doesn't seem to represent the correct relationship. Let me think again. The correct selling price is 1.4x * 0.8, which is 1.12x. The profit is 1.12x - x = 0.12x, which is 270. So, 0.12x = 270, leading to x = 2250. So, Xiao Hong's equation is incorrect because she multiplied x by 40% and then 80%, which is not the right way to calculate the selling price after a 40% increase and then a 20% discount. Instead, the correct approach is to first increase x by 40%, getting 1.4x, and then apply the 20% discount on that increased price, which is 1.4x * 0.8 = 1.12x. Therefore, her equation should have been 1.4x * 0.8 - x = 270, which simplifies to 0.12x = 270, leading to x = 2250 yuan. So, in conclusion, Xiao Hong's equation is incorrect. The correct equation is 1.4x * 0.8 - x = 270, which gives x = 2250 yuan."},{"question":"The greatest common divisor of 204 and 85 is __________.","answer":"To find the greatest common divisor of 204 and 85, I will use the Euclidean algorithm.First, I divide 204 by 85.

At the beginning of the festival, all of them lined up so that no two people with the same name stood next to each other. What is the minimum number of Gennadys that could have attended the festival?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a festival where people with different names are lining up. The names are Alexander, Boris, Vasily, and Gennady. The numbers given are 45 Alexanders, 122 Borises, 27 Vasily, and an unknown number of Gennadys. The key point is that they all lined up in such a way that no two people with the same name are next to each other. I need to find the minimum number of Gennadys that could have attended the festival.Hmm, so first, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have four groups of people with different names: Alex, Boris, Vasily, and Gennady. Each group has a certain number of people: 45, 122, 27, and some unknown number, let's call it G. They all line up in a single line, and the rule is that no two people with the same name can be next to each other. We need to find the smallest possible G such that this is possible.So, this seems like a problem related to arranging items with certain constraints. I remember something about the pigeonhole principle and maybe some concepts from combinatorics. Let me think.When arranging people so that no two of the same name are adjacent, the maximum number of people you can have without violating the rule depends on the size of the largest group. If one group is significantly larger than the others, you might need more people from other groups to separate them.Wait, actually, I think this relates to the concept of graph coloring, where each person is a node, and edges connect people who can't be next to each other. But maybe that's overcomplicating it.Alternatively, I recall that for such problems, the minimum number of people needed to separate the largest group is related to the size of the largest group minus one. For example, if you have n people of the same name, you need at least n-1 people from other groups to separate them.But in this case, we have multiple groups, so maybe the formula is a bit different. Let me think.Suppose we have four groups: A (45), B (122), V (27), and G (unknown). The largest group is B with 122 people. To arrange them so that no two Bs are next to each other, we need at least 121 people from other groups to separate them. Because each B needs to be separated by at least one person from another group.But wait, that's just for the Borises. However, we also have Alexanders and Vasilys. So, maybe the total number of people from the other groups needs to be sufficient to separate all the Borises, but also, we have to consider the Alexanders and Vasilys as well.Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the maximum number of people that can be arranged without having two of the same name adjacent. The formula for that is something like the sum of the sizes of the smaller groups plus one. Wait, no, that might not be exactly right.Wait, actually, there's a theorem in combinatorics called the rearrangement theorem or something similar. It states that the minimal number of people needed to separate the largest group is such that the total number of people from the other groups is at least the size of the largest group minus one.So, in this case, the largest group is B with 122. So, the total number of people from A, V, and G should be at least 121. Because each B needs to be separated by at least one person from another group.So, the total number of non-Borises is 45 (A) + 27 (V) + G (unknown). So, 45 + 27 + G >= 121.Calculating that, 45 + 27 is 72. So, 72 + G >= 121. Therefore, G >= 121 - 72 = 49. So, G must be at least 49.But wait, is that the only consideration? Because we also have to arrange the Alexanders and Vasilys such that they don't end up next to each other either. So, maybe the minimal number of Gennadys also needs to consider the arrangement of A and V.Hmm, so perhaps the minimal number of Gennadys is determined by the maximum between the requirement to separate the Borises and the requirement to separate the Alexanders and Vasilys.Wait, let's think about that. The Alexanders are 45, which is less than the Borises, but still, we need to make sure that Alexanders are also not next to each other. Similarly for Vasilys, which are 27.So, for the Alexanders, to arrange them without being next to each other, we need at least 44 people from other groups to separate them. Similarly, for Vasilys, we need at least 26 people from other groups.But in our case, the other groups include Borises, which are 122, so maybe that's not a problem? Wait, no, because we already have the constraint that no two same names can be next to each other, regardless of the name.So, actually, we need to consider the overall arrangement where all four groups are interleaved without any two same names adjacent.So, perhaps the minimal number of Gennadys is determined by the maximum of the required separators for each group.Wait, but actually, the minimal number of Gennadys would be such that the total number of non-Borises is sufficient to separate the Borises, and the total number of non-Alexandrs is sufficient to separate the Alexanders, and the same for Vasilys.But that might complicate things. Maybe I need to model this as a graph or something.Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of Gennadys is the maximum between (122 - 1) - (45 + 27) and (45 - 1) - (122 + 27) and (27 - 1) - (122 + 45)). But that might not make sense because if the result is negative, we can ignore it.Wait, let me think again.The general formula for the minimal number of separators needed for a group of size n is n - 1. So, for each group, the number of separators needed is the size of the group minus one.But in our case, the separators can be from any of the other groups. So, the total number of separators needed is the maximum of (A - 1, B - 1, V - 1, G - 1). But since we don't know G, perhaps we need to ensure that the sum of the other groups is sufficient to cover the separators needed for the largest group.Wait, maybe I should think of it as arranging the people in such a way that the most frequent name is separated by the others.So, the maximum number of any single name is 122 (Borises). To arrange them without two Bs adjacent, we need at least 121 separators, which can be from A, V, or G.So, the total number of separators available is 45 + 27 + G = 72 + G.Therefore, 72 + G >= 121 => G >= 49.But also, we have to make sure that the Alexanders and Vasilys are also not adjacent to themselves.So, for Alexanders, 45 people, so we need at least 44 separators. The separators can be from B, V, or G.Similarly, for Vasilys, 27 people, so 26 separators needed, which can be from A, B, or G.But since B is the largest group, and we already have 122 Bs, which are more than enough to separate A and V, maybe we don't need to worry about A and V as much.Wait, but actually, the separators for A and V can be from B or G. Since B is 122, which is more than enough to separate A and V, maybe we don't need to add more Gennadys for that purpose.But wait, actually, the separators for A and V can be from B or G, but since we are already using B to separate A and V, maybe that doesn't add any additional constraints.Wait, perhaps the main constraint is just the separation of the largest group, which is B. So, as long as the total number of non-Bs is at least 121, we can arrange the line so that no two Bs are adjacent, and the other groups can be arranged in between.But then, is 49 Gennadys enough? Because 45 A + 27 V + 49 G = 121, which is exactly the number needed to separate the 122 Bs.But wait, let me think about how the arrangement would look.If we have 122 Bs, we need 121 separators. So, the arrangement would be something like B X B X B X ... where X is a non-B.So, the total number of positions is 122 + 121 = 243.But we also have 45 A, 27 V, and G. So, the total number of non-Bs is 45 + 27 + G = 72 + G.But we need 121 non-Bs to separate the Bs. So, 72 + G >= 121 => G >= 49.But the total number of people is 122 + 45 + 27 + G = 194 + G.But the arrangement requires 243 positions, so 194 + G >= 243 => G >= 49.Wait, that's the same result.But also, we have to make sure that the non-Bs can be arranged in such a way that no two As or Vs are adjacent.So, after placing the Bs with non-Bs in between, we have to arrange the As and Vs among the non-Bs.But the non-Bs are 72 + G, which is 121 when G=49.So, in that case, the non-Bs are exactly 121, which are used to separate the Bs.But then, we have 45 As and 27 Vs to place among these 121 non-B positions.Wait, but 45 + 27 = 72, which is less than 121. So, we have 121 positions where we can place the As and Vs, but we only need to place 72 of them.Wait, but actually, the non-Bs are exactly 121, which are used as separators. So, each separator is a single person, either A, V, or G.So, if we have 121 separators, and we have 45 A, 27 V, and G=49, then 45 + 27 + 49 = 121. So, each separator is exactly one person, so we can place all the As, Vs, and Gs in the separator positions.But then, in that case, the As, Vs, and Gs are each in their own positions, so no two As or Vs are adjacent because they are separated by Bs.Wait, but actually, no, because the separators are all non-Bs, which include As, Vs, and Gs. So, if we have multiple As or Vs in the separators, they could end up next to each other.Wait, hold on, that's a problem.Because if we have, for example, two As next to each other in the separator positions, that would mean two As are adjacent, which violates the condition.So, actually, the separators themselves must also be arranged so that no two same names are adjacent.So, in addition to separating the Bs, we also have to arrange the As, Vs, and Gs in the separator positions without having two of the same name adjacent.Therefore, the separators themselves form another arrangement where no two same names are adjacent.So, this is a nested problem.So, the separators (non-Bs) must be arranged in such a way that no two As, Vs, or Gs are adjacent.Therefore, the minimal number of Gennadys is not just 49, because we also have to arrange the As and Vs among the separators without them being adjacent.So, perhaps we need to calculate the minimal number of Gennadys such that the As and Vs can be arranged in the separators without being adjacent.So, let's think about the separators as another line of people, consisting of 45 As, 27 Vs, and G Gs, arranged so that no two same names are adjacent.So, in this separator line, we have to arrange 45 A, 27 V, and G Gs without any two same names adjacent.So, the minimal number of Gs needed here is such that the total number of Gs is at least the maximum of (A - 1, V - 1, G - 1). Wait, no, that's not quite right.Wait, actually, for arranging the separators, the minimal number of Gs needed is such that the number of Gs is at least the maximum of (number of As - 1, number of Vs - 1, number of Gs - 1). But since we are trying to minimize G, perhaps we need to ensure that the number of Gs is sufficient to separate the As and Vs.Wait, perhaps the minimal number of Gs needed is the maximum between (number of As - 1, number of Vs - 1). Because if we have enough Gs to separate the As and Vs, then we can arrange them alternately.So, the number of Gs needed is at least the maximum of (45 - 1, 27 - 1) = 44.But we already have 49 Gs from the previous calculation, so 49 is more than 44, so that's okay.But wait, maybe we need to consider the total number of separators.Wait, let's think again.In the separator line, we have 45 As, 27 Vs, and G Gs. The total number of people is 45 + 27 + G = 72 + G.To arrange them without two same names adjacent, the minimal number of Gs needed is such that the number of Gs is at least the maximum of (number of As, number of Vs) minus 1.Wait, actually, the formula for the minimal number of separators needed to arrange two groups without adjacency is that the number of separators should be at least the size of the larger group minus one.So, in this case, the larger group among A and V is A with 45. So, to arrange 45 As and 27 Vs without two As or two Vs adjacent, we need at least 44 separators, which can be Gs.But since we already have Gs, the number of Gs should be at least 44.But in our case, we have Gs being used both as separators for Bs and as separators for As and Vs.Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.Let me try a different approach.First, the main arrangement is a line of people where no two same names are adjacent. The groups are A (45), B (122), V (27), G (G).The largest group is B with 122. To arrange them without two Bs adjacent, we need at least 121 non-Bs.So, non-Bs are A, V, G: 45 + 27 + G = 72 + G.Thus, 72 + G >= 121 => G >= 49.But now, within these non-Bs, we have to arrange 45 As, 27 Vs, and G Gs without two same names adjacent.So, the non-Bs themselves form a sequence where no two same names are adjacent.So, in this sub-problem, the non-Bs consist of A, V, G. The largest group among them is A with 45.To arrange 45 As, 27 Vs, and G Gs without two same names adjacent, we need at least 44 separators.But the separators can be Vs or Gs.So, the number of separators needed is 44, which can be provided by Vs and Gs.We have 27 Vs, so the number of Gs needed is at least 44 - 27 = 17.Therefore, G >= 17.But we already have G >= 49 from the main problem. So, the more restrictive condition is G >= 49.But wait, let me verify this.If G = 49, then the non-Bs are 45 A, 27 V, 49 G.Total non-Bs: 121.Now, arranging these 121 non-Bs such that no two same names are adjacent.The largest group is A with 45. So, to arrange 45 As, we need at least 44 separators.The separators can be V or G.We have 27 Vs and 49 Gs, so total separators available: 27 + 49 = 76.Which is more than 44, so it's possible.Therefore, arranging the non-Bs is feasible.So, the minimal number of Gennadys is 49.Wait, but let me think again.Is 49 the minimal number? Because if we have 49 Gs, then the non-Bs are 45 A, 27 V, 49 G.But when arranging these, the maximum number of any single name is 45 (A). So, to arrange 45 As, we need 44 separators.But we have 27 Vs and 49 Gs, so 76 separators.So, 76 >= 44, which is true.But also, we have to make sure that the Vs and Gs are arranged in such a way that they don't cause two As to be adjacent.Wait, actually, the arrangement of the non-Bs can be done by interleaving the As, Vs, and Gs.But since we have more Gs than needed, we can alternate them appropriately.So, for example, we can arrange the non-Bs as A, G, A, G, ..., which would separate the As with Gs.But since we have more Gs than needed, we can also place Vs in between.Wait, but perhaps a better way is to arrange the non-Bs in a way that the largest group (A) is separated by the other groups.So, starting with A, then V or G, then A, and so on.But since we have more Gs, we can use them as the main separators.So, the minimal number of Gs is 49, which allows us to separate the 122 Bs, and within the non-Bs, we have enough Gs to separate the As and Vs.Therefore, I think the minimal number of Gennadys is 49.But let me check if 49 is indeed sufficient.So, total non-Bs: 45 + 27 + 49 = 121.These 121 non-Bs are used to separate the 122 Bs, so the arrangement would be B X B X ... B, where X is a non-B.Now, within the X positions, we have 45 A, 27 V, 49 G.We need to arrange these 121 non-Bs without two same names adjacent.Since the largest group is A with 45, we need to separate them with at least 44 other people.We have 27 Vs and 49 Gs, which sum to 76, which is more than 44.So, we can arrange the non-Bs as A, G, A, G, ..., and place the Vs in the remaining positions.Since we have more Gs, we can alternate A and G, and then place the Vs where possible.Alternatively, we can arrange them in a sequence where A is separated by G and V.So, for example: A, G, A, V, A, G, A, V, ..., and so on.Since we have enough Gs and Vs to separate the As, this should be possible.Therefore, 49 Gs are sufficient.Is it possible to have fewer than 49 Gs?Suppose G = 48.Then, total non-Bs = 45 + 27 + 48 = 120.But we need 121 non-Bs to separate the 122 Bs. So, 120 < 121, which is insufficient.Therefore, G cannot be less than 49.Hence, the minimal number of Gennadys is 49.**Final Answer**The minimum number of Gennadys that could have attended the festival is boxed{49}."},{"question":"Find the smallest ( n > 2016 ) such that ( 1^{n} + 2^{n} + 3^{n} + 4^{n} ) is not divisible by 10.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the smallest integer n greater than 2016 such that the sum (1^n + 2^n + 3^n + 4^n) isn't divisible by 10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that whether a number is divisible by 10 depends on its last digit. So, if I can figure out the last digit of each term (1^n), (2^n), (3^n), and (4^n), I can add them up and see if the total ends with a 0. If it doesn't, then the sum isn't divisible by 10.Let me recall that the last digit of powers cycles in a pattern. For example, 2^n cycles every 4: 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, etc. Similarly, 3^n cycles every 4 as well: 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, etc. 4^n cycles every 2: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc. And 1^n is always 1, so that's straightforward.So, for each base (1, 2, 3, 4), I can figure out the cycle length of their last digits. Then, for a given exponent n, I can find where n falls in each cycle to determine the last digit.Let me write down the cycles:- 1^n: Always ends with 1.- 2^n: Cycle is 2, 4, 8, 6. So cycle length 4.- 3^n: Cycle is 3, 9, 7, 1. So cycle length 4.- 4^n: Cycle is 4, 6. So cycle length 2.Therefore, to find the last digit of each term, I can compute n modulo the cycle length.For 2^n: last digit is determined by n mod 4.For 3^n: last digit is determined by n mod 4.For 4^n: last digit is determined by n mod 2.Since 1^n is always 1, I don't need to worry about that.So, let's denote:- Let ( a = n mod 4 ) for 2^n and 3^n.- Let ( b = n mod 2 ) for 4^n.Then, the last digits are:- 1^n: 1- 2^n: If a=1, 2; a=2, 4; a=3, 8; a=0, 6.- 3^n: If a=1, 3; a=2, 9; a=3, 7; a=0, 1.- 4^n: If b=1, 4; b=0, 6.So, the sum of the last digits is 1 + [2^n last digit] + [3^n last digit] + [4^n last digit]. We need this sum not to be congruent to 0 modulo 10.So, let's denote S(n) = 1 + (last digit of 2^n) + (last digit of 3^n) + (last digit of 4^n). We need S(n) mod 10 ≠ 0.Our goal is to find the smallest n > 2016 where S(n) mod 10 ≠ 0.Since 2016 is a specific number, maybe I can compute S(2016) first and see if it's 0 mod 10. If it is, then I need to find the next n where S(n) ≠ 0 mod 10.But let's see, 2016 is a multiple of 4 and 2, so n=2016.Compute a = 2016 mod 4 = 0Compute b = 2016 mod 2 = 0So, 2^2016 last digit is 63^2016 last digit is 14^2016 last digit is 6Therefore, S(2016) = 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 14. 14 mod 10 = 4 ≠ 0. Wait, so S(2016) is 14, which is 4 mod 10. So, it's already not divisible by 10. But the problem says n > 2016, so the next n after 2016.Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.Wait, 2016 is the starting point, but the problem says n > 2016, so the smallest n greater than 2016. So, n=2017, 2018, etc.But first, let's confirm S(2016). 2^2016: since 2016 mod 4 is 0, last digit 6. 3^2016: 2016 mod 4 is 0, last digit 1. 4^2016: 2016 mod 2 is 0, last digit 6. So, 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 14. 14 mod 10 is 4. So, 2016 is already not divisible by 10. But the question is asking for n > 2016. So, maybe n=2017 is the next one. Let's compute S(2017).Compute a = 2017 mod 4 = 1Compute b = 2017 mod 2 = 1So, 2^2017 last digit: a=1, so 23^2017 last digit: a=1, so 34^2017 last digit: b=1, so 4Thus, S(2017) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. 10 mod 10 = 0. So, S(2017) is divisible by 10.Hmm, so 2017 is bad. Let's try n=2018.a = 2018 mod 4 = 2b = 2018 mod 2 = 02^2018 last digit: a=2, so 43^2018 last digit: a=2, so 94^2018 last digit: b=0, so 6So, S(2018) = 1 + 4 + 9 + 6 = 20. 20 mod 10 = 0. So, 2018 is also bad.n=2019.a = 2019 mod 4 = 3b = 2019 mod 2 = 12^2019 last digit: a=3, so 83^2019 last digit: a=3, so 74^2019 last digit: b=1, so 4S(2019) = 1 + 8 + 7 + 4 = 20. 20 mod 10 = 0. Still bad.n=2020.a = 2020 mod 4 = 0b = 2020 mod 2 = 02^2020 last digit: 63^2020 last digit: 14^2020 last digit: 6S(2020) = 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 14. 14 mod 10 = 4. So, not divisible by 10.Wait, so n=2020 gives S(n)=14, which is 4 mod 10. So, 2020 is good.But wait, is 2020 the next one after 2016? Let me check n=2017, 2018, 2019, 2020.We saw that 2017: 10, 2018:20, 2019:20, 2020:14.So, n=2020 is the first n >2016 where S(n) is not divisible by 10.But hold on, is 2020 the smallest? Let me check n=2021.a=2021 mod4=1, b=12^2021:2, 3^2021:3, 4^2021:4S=1+2+3+4=10, which is 0 mod10.Similarly, n=2022:a=2022 mod4=2, b=02^2022:4, 3^2022:9, 4^2022:6S=1+4+9+6=20, 0 mod10.n=2023:a=3, b=12^2023:8, 3^2023:7, 4^2023:4S=1+8+7+4=20, 0 mod10.n=2024:a=0, b=02^2024:6, 3^2024:1, 4^2024:6S=1+6+1+6=14, 4 mod10.So, n=2024 is also good.Wait, so the pattern is that every 4 numbers, starting from 2016, the S(n) alternates between 4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,...Wait, let's see:n=2016:14 (4 mod10)n=2017:10 (0)n=2018:20 (0)n=2019:20 (0)n=2020:14 (4)n=2021:10 (0)n=2022:20 (0)n=2023:20 (0)n=2024:14 (4)...So, every 4 numbers, the S(n) mod10 cycles through 4,0,0,0.Therefore, the numbers n where S(n) is not divisible by10 are n=2016,2020,2024,... So, every 4 numbers starting from 2016.But the problem asks for n>2016, so the next one is 2020.Wait, but let me confirm with n=2016,2017,2018,2019,2020.Yes, n=2016:14, n=2017:10, n=2018:20, n=2019:20, n=2020:14.So, 2020 is the next n>2016 where S(n) is not divisible by10.But wait, is there a smaller n>2016 where S(n) is not divisible by10? Because 2016 is already not divisible by10, but n must be greater than 2016. So, the next one is 2020.But let me think again: n=2016:14, n=2017:10, n=2018:20, n=2019:20, n=2020:14. So, 2020 is the next one.Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute S(n) mod10.Let me try to express S(n) mod10 in terms of n mod4 and n mod2.Since 2^n and 3^n depend on n mod4, and 4^n depends on n mod2.Let me denote:Let’s define:For 2^n: last digit is f(a) where a = n mod4.Similarly, for 3^n: last digit is g(a) where a = n mod4.For 4^n: last digit is h(b) where b = n mod2.So, f(a) is:a=0:6a=1:2a=2:4a=3:8g(a) is:a=0:1a=1:3a=2:9a=3:7h(b) is:b=0:6b=1:4So, S(n) mod10 = [1 + f(a) + g(a) + h(b)] mod10.But since a = n mod4, and b = n mod2. But note that b is determined by a: if a is even, then b=0; if a is odd, b=1.Because n mod4 can be 0,1,2,3. So:If a=0: n is 0 mod4, so n is 0 mod2, so b=0.If a=1: n is 1 mod4, so n is 1 mod2, so b=1.If a=2: n is 2 mod4, so n is 0 mod2, so b=0.If a=3: n is 3 mod4, so n is 1 mod2, so b=1.Therefore, we can express S(n) mod10 in terms of a only.So, for each a in {0,1,2,3}, we can compute S(n) mod10.Let me compute S(n) mod10 for each a:Case 1: a=0Then, f(a)=6, g(a)=1, b=0, so h(b)=6.Thus, S(n) mod10 = (1 + 6 + 1 + 6) mod10 = 14 mod10 = 4.Case 2: a=1f(a)=2, g(a)=3, b=1, h(b)=4.S(n) mod10 = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) mod10 = 10 mod10 = 0.Case 3: a=2f(a)=4, g(a)=9, b=0, h(b)=6.S(n) mod10 = (1 + 4 + 9 + 6) mod10 = 20 mod10 = 0.Case 4: a=3f(a)=8, g(a)=7, b=1, h(b)=4.S(n) mod10 = (1 + 8 + 7 + 4) mod10 = 20 mod10 = 0.So, summarizing:- If a=0 (i.e., n ≡0 mod4), S(n) ≡4 mod10.- If a=1,2,3 (i.e., n≡1,2,3 mod4), S(n)≡0 mod10.Therefore, S(n) is not divisible by10 only when n≡0 mod4. So, n must be a multiple of4.But wait, n=2016 is a multiple of4, as 2016=4*504. So, n=2016 is 0 mod4.But n>2016, so the next multiple of4 is 2020.Therefore, the smallest n>2016 where S(n) is not divisible by10 is 2020.Wait, that seems consistent with my earlier calculations.So, to confirm:n=2016: multiple of4, S(n)=14≡4 mod10.n=2017:1 mod4, S(n)=10≡0.n=2018:2 mod4, S(n)=20≡0.n=2019:3 mod4, S(n)=20≡0.n=2020:0 mod4, S(n)=14≡4.Thus, 2020 is the next n>2016 where S(n) is not divisible by10.Therefore, the answer is 2020.**Final Answer**The smallest ( n > 2016 ) is boxed{2020}."},{"question":"Multiply 15.46 by 100.","answer":"To multiply 15.46 by 100, I recognize that multiplying by 100 shifts the decimal point two places to the right.Starting with 15.46, moving the decimal point two places to the right gives me 1546.Therefore, 15.46 multiplied by 100 equals 1546."},{"question":"(Full score: 8 points)  During the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, there were as many as 11 types of admission tickets.

The total revenue from these tickets is 216,000 yuan.This gives me two equations:1. ( x + y = 1200 )2. ( 200x + 120y = 216000 )To solve this system of equations, I can use the substitution method.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but maybe I can figure it out step by step.First, let me write down the expression to make it clearer:tan 13° + tan 32° + tan 13° * tan 32°Hmm, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities involving the tangent of sums or differences of angles. Maybe I can use one of those here. Let me recall... Oh, right! The tangent addition formula:tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)Wait, that's the formula for tan(A + B). So if I rearrange this formula, maybe I can express tan A + tan B in terms of tan(A + B). Let me try that.Starting with:tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)If I multiply both sides by (1 - tan A tan B), I get:tan(A + B) * (1 - tan A tan B) = tan A + tan BExpanding the left side:tan(A + B) - tan(A + B) tan A tan B = tan A + tan BHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can solve for tan A + tan B:tan A + tan B = tan(A + B) * (1 - tan A tan B)Wait, but that still has tan A tan B in it. Let me think differently. Maybe I can isolate tan A + tan B + tan A tan B.Looking back at the original expression: tan 13° + tan 32° + tan 13° tan 32°. If I factor something out, maybe I can relate it to the tangent addition formula.Let me denote A = 13° and B = 32°, so the expression becomes:tan A + tan B + tan A tan BLooking at the tangent addition formula again:tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)Let me solve for (tan A + tan B):tan A + tan B = tan(A + B) * (1 - tan A tan B)So, substituting back into our expression:tan A + tan B + tan A tan B = tan(A + B) * (1 - tan A tan B) + tan A tan BLet me distribute tan(A + B):= tan(A + B) - tan(A + B) tan A tan B + tan A tan BHmm, this seems a bit complicated.

Let me think again.Alternatively, maybe I can factor the expression tan A + tan B + tan A tan B in a different way. Let me see:tan A + tan B + tan A tan B = tan A (1 + tan B) + tan BHmm, not sure. Alternatively, factor tan A:= tan A (1 + tan B) + tan BStill not helpful.Wait, maybe I can write it as:tan A + tan B + tan A tan B = (tan A + tan B) + tan A tan BFrom the tangent addition formula, we have:tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)So, if I let S = tan A + tan B and P = tan A tan B, then:tan(A + B) = S / (1 - P)So, S = tan(A + B) * (1 - P)Therefore, S + P = tan(A + B) * (1 - P) + P= tan(A + B) - tan(A + B) P + P= tan(A + B) + P (1 - tan(A + B))Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe plug in the values.Given A = 13°, B = 32°, so A + B = 45°. Oh! 45 degrees is a nice angle because tan 45° = 1.So, let's compute tan(A + B):tan(13° + 32°) = tan(45°) = 1So, from the tangent addition formula:1 = (tan 13° + tan 32°) / (1 - tan 13° tan 32°)Therefore, cross-multiplying:tan 13° + tan 32° = 1 * (1 - tan 13° tan 32°)So, tan 13° + tan 32° = 1 - tan 13° tan 32°Therefore, if I add tan 13° tan 32° to both sides:tan 13° + tan 32° + tan 13° tan 32° = 1Wow, that's neat! So, the expression simplifies to 1.Wait, let me double-check that. If tan(A + B) = 1, and A + B = 45°, which is correct. Then, using the formula, we have tan A + tan B = 1 - tan A tan B.

Dividing 999 by 5 gives 199.8, so there are 199 numbers divisible by 5.Then, I'll determine how many numbers are divisible by 7. Dividing 999 by 7 results in approximately 142.714, meaning there are 142 numbers divisible by 7.However, some numbers are divisible by both 5 and 7, which means they are divisible by 35.

The complex number is given as z = (m² - 2m - 3) + (m + 1)i. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.First, I remember that a complex number is generally written as a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. For a complex number to be purely imaginary, the real part has to be zero. That means the 'a' part in a + bi should be zero, and the 'b' part should not be zero. So, in this case, the real part of z is (m² - 2m - 3), and the imaginary part is (m + 1).So, to make z purely imaginary, I need to set the real part equal to zero and solve for m. That gives me the equation:m² - 2m - 3 = 0Alright, now I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it. The quadratic is m² - 2m - 3. I need two numbers that multiply to -3 and add up to -2. Hmm, let me think. The factors of -3 could be 1 and -3 or -1 and 3. Let me check:1 * (-3) = -3, and 1 + (-3) = -2. Perfect! So, the equation factors as:(m + 1)(m - 3) = 0So, setting each factor equal to zero gives me the possible solutions for m:m + 1 = 0  =>  m = -1m - 3 = 0  =>  m = 3Okay, so m can be either -1 or 3. But wait, I need to make sure that the imaginary part isn't zero because if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, then z would just be zero, which is technically a real number and not purely imaginary. So, I should check the imaginary part for these values of m to ensure it's not zero.The imaginary part is (m + 1). Let's plug in m = -1:Imaginary part = (-1) + 1 = 0Oh no, that gives zero. So, if m = -1, then the imaginary part is zero, which would make z = 0, which is not purely imaginary. So, m = -1 is not a valid solution.Now, let's check m = 3:Imaginary part = 3 + 1 = 4That's not zero, so z would be 0 + 4i, which is purely imaginary. Perfect.So, m = 3 is the valid solution. Therefore, the value of m is 3.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me double-check my factoring. The quadratic was m² - 2m - 3. Factoring into (m + 1)(m - 3) gives m² - 3m + m - 3, which simplifies to m² - 2m - 3. Yep, that's correct.And plugging m = 3 into the real part: 3² - 2*3 - 3 = 9 - 6 - 3 = 0. Correct. And the imaginary part is 4i, which is fine.Plugging m = -1 into the real part: (-1)² - 2*(-1) - 3 = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0. Correct. But the imaginary part is zero, so z is zero, which isn't purely imaginary. So, m = -1 is invalid.Therefore, the only valid solution is m = 3.**Final Answer**The value of the real number ( m ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"What is w + 2 - 3w - 4 + 5w + 6 - 7w - 8?","answer":"First, I will combine the like terms in the expression ( w + 2 - 3w - 4 + 5w + 6 - 7w - 8 ).Combining the ( w ) terms:( w - 3w + 5w - 7w = (1 - 3 + 5 - 7)w = (-4 + 5 - 7)w = (1 - 7)w = -6w )Next, combining the constant terms:( 2 - 4 + 6 - 8 = (2 - 4) + (6 - 8) = (-2) + (-2) = -4 )Finally, combining the results:( -6w - 4 )"},{"question":"Palindromes are numbers that read the same backwards and forwards, like 5665.

A marksman is to break all the targets according to the following rules:1) The marksman first chooses a column from which a target is to be broken.2) The marksman must then break the lowest remaining target in the chosen column.If the rules are followed, in how many different orders can the eight targets be broken?","answer":"Okay, so I have this shooting match problem where there are eight clay targets arranged in columns. Specifically, there are two columns with three targets each and one column with two targets. The marksman has to break all the targets following two rules: first, choose a column, and then break the lowest remaining target in that column. I need to figure out how many different orders the eight targets can be broken.Hmm, let me visualize this. There are three columns: let's say Column A has three targets, Column B has three targets, and Column C has two targets. So, A: 3, B: 3, C: 2. The marksman has to break them starting from the bottom each time in the chosen column. So, essentially, it's about the sequence in which the columns are chosen, with the constraint that within each column, the order is fixed from bottom to top.This seems similar to a problem where you have multiple tasks, each consisting of several steps, and you need to find the number of ways to interleave these steps. In combinatorics, this is often solved using multinomial coefficients. Let me recall: if you have a total number of tasks, say n, divided into groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km, then the number of ways to arrange them is n! divided by the product of k1! k2! ... km!.In this case, the total number of targets is 8, which is the sum of the targets in each column: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. So, n is 8. The groups are the columns, each with sizes 3, 3, and 2. So, the number of different orders should be 8! divided by (3! * 3! * 2!). Let me compute that.First, 8! is 40320. Then, 3! is 6, so 6 * 6 * 2 is 72. So, 40320 divided by 72. Let me calculate that: 40320 / 72. Well, 72 times 500 is 36,000. Subtract that from 40,320, which leaves 4320. 72 goes into 4320 exactly 60 times because 72*60=4320. So, 500 + 60 is 560. So, 40320 / 72 is 560.Wait, so is the answer 560 different orders? That seems plausible, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning.Another way to think about it is that each order corresponds to a sequence of choices where the marksman picks a column each time, but cannot pick a column more times than the number of targets in it. So, it's like arranging a multiset permutation where we have 3 A's, 3 B's, and 2 C's. The number of distinct sequences is indeed 8! / (3!3!2!) which is 560.But just to double-check, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose there were two columns, one with 1 target and another with 1 target. Then, the number of orders would be 2! / (1!1!) = 2, which makes sense: either break the first column then the second, or vice versa.Another test case: three columns with 2, 1, and 1 targets. The number of orders should be 4! / (2!1!1!) = 12. Let me enumerate them:The columns are A (2 targets), B (1 target), and C (1 target). The sequences would be:1. A, A, B, C2. A, A, C, B3. A, B, A, C4. A, B, C, A5. A, C, A, B6. A, C, B, A7. B, A, A, C8. B, A, C, A9. B, C, A, A10. C, A, A, B11. C, A, B, A12. C, B, A, AYes, that's 12 sequences, which matches the formula. So, the formula seems to hold for smaller cases.Therefore, going back to the original problem, with columns of 3, 3, and 2, the number of different orders is 8! / (3!3!2!) = 560. So, I think that's the answer.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using recursion or dynamic programming.Suppose I define a function f(a, b, c) which represents the number of ways to break the targets when there are a targets left in column A, b in column B, and c in column C. The base case would be f(0,0,0) = 1, meaning there's one way to break all targets when none are left. For other cases, f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-1,c) + f(a,b,c-1), provided that a, b, c are positive.So, in our case, we need to compute f(3,3,2). Let me try to compute this step by step.But computing f(3,3,2) manually would take a lot of steps. Maybe I can find a pattern or relate it to the multinomial coefficient.Wait, actually, this recursive approach is essentially counting the number of interleavings, which is exactly what the multinomial coefficient does. So, f(a,b,c) is equal to (a+b+c)! / (a!b!c!). Therefore, f(3,3,2) is 8! / (3!3!2!) = 560. So, that confirms the earlier result.Alternatively, another way to think about it is using combinations. First, choose the positions in the sequence where the targets from column A are broken. There are 8 positions, and we need to choose 3 for column A. Then, from the remaining 5 positions, choose 3 for column B. The remaining 2 positions will automatically be for column C.So, the number of ways is C(8,3) * C(5,3) * C(2,2). Let's compute that:C(8,3) is 56, C(5,3) is 10, and C(2,2) is 1. So, 56 * 10 * 1 = 560. Yep, same answer.So, all these different methods are leading me to the same result: 560. Therefore, I can be confident that the number of different orders is 560.**Final Answer**The number of different orders is boxed{560}."},{"question":"Find the constant c such that the remainder when 2x+7 divides 2x^3+cx^2-11x+39 is 4.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the constant ( c ) such that when ( 2x + 7 ) divides ( 2x^3 + cx^2 - 11x + 39 ), the remainder is 4. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when you divide a polynomial ( f(x) ) by another polynomial ( g(x) ), you get a quotient ( q(x) ) and a remainder ( r(x) ), such that ( f(x) = g(x) cdot q(x) + r(x) ). In this case, ( f(x) ) is ( 2x^3 + cx^2 - 11x + 39 ) and ( g(x) ) is ( 2x + 7 ). The remainder ( r(x) ) is given as 4, which is a constant, so that makes sense because when you divide by a linear polynomial, the remainder should be a constant.So, according to the division algorithm, I can write:( 2x^3 + cx^2 - 11x + 39 = (2x + 7) cdot q(x) + 4 )Now, I need to find ( c ). Hmm, how can I find ( c )? Maybe I can use the Remainder Theorem? Wait, the Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial ( f(x) ) by ( x - a ) is ( f(a) ). But here, the divisor is ( 2x + 7 ), not ( x - a ). Maybe I can adjust it to fit the form required by the Remainder Theorem.Let me solve ( 2x + 7 = 0 ) to find the value of ( x ) that makes the divisor zero. So,( 2x + 7 = 0 )( 2x = -7 )( x = -frac{7}{2} )Okay, so the root is ( x = -frac{7}{2} ). According to the Remainder Theorem, if I substitute ( x = -frac{7}{2} ) into ( f(x) ), the result should be equal to the remainder, which is 4. So,( fleft(-frac{7}{2}right) = 4 )Let me compute ( fleft(-frac{7}{2}right) ):( fleft(-frac{7}{2}right) = 2left(-frac{7}{2}right)^3 + cleft(-frac{7}{2}right)^2 - 11left(-frac{7}{2}right) + 39 )Let me compute each term step by step.First term: ( 2left(-frac{7}{2}right)^3 )Let me compute ( left(-frac{7}{2}right)^3 ):( left(-frac{7}{2}right)^3 = -frac{343}{8} )So, multiplying by 2:( 2 times -frac{343}{8} = -frac{686}{8} = -frac{343}{4} )Okay, so the first term is ( -frac{343}{4} ).Second term: ( cleft(-frac{7}{2}right)^2 )Compute ( left(-frac{7}{2}right)^2 ):( left(-frac{7}{2}right)^2 = frac{49}{4} )So, the second term is ( c times frac{49}{4} = frac{49c}{4} )Third term: ( -11left(-frac{7}{2}right) )Multiply:( -11 times -frac{7}{2} = frac{77}{2} )Fourth term: 39, which is just 39.So, putting it all together:( fleft(-frac{7}{2}right) = -frac{343}{4} + frac{49c}{4} + frac{77}{2} + 39 )Now, let me combine these terms. To do that, I need to have a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 4, 2, and 1. The common denominator is 4.Convert each term:- ( -frac{343}{4} ) is already over 4.- ( frac{49c}{4} ) is already over 4.- ( frac{77}{2} = frac{154}{4} )- ( 39 = frac{156}{4} ) (since 39 * 4 = 156)So, substituting back:( fleft(-frac{7}{2}right) = -frac{343}{4} + frac{49c}{4} + frac{154}{4} + frac{156}{4} )Now, combine all the constants:( -frac{343}{4} + frac{154}{4} + frac{156}{4} = left(-343 + 154 + 156right)/4 )Compute the numerator:-343 + 154 = -189-189 + 156 = -33So, the constants add up to ( -frac{33}{4} )Therefore, the entire expression becomes:( fleft(-frac{7}{2}right) = frac{49c}{4} - frac{33}{4} )And we know this equals 4. So,( frac{49c}{4} - frac{33}{4} = 4 )Let me solve for ( c ):First, add ( frac{33}{4} ) to both sides:( frac{49c}{4} = 4 + frac{33}{4} )Convert 4 to fourths:4 = ( frac{16}{4} )So,( frac{49c}{4} = frac{16}{4} + frac{33}{4} = frac{49}{4} )Now, multiply both sides by 4:( 49c = 49 )Divide both sides by 49:( c = 1 )Wait, so ( c = 1 )? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from the substitution:( fleft(-frac{7}{2}right) = 2left(-frac{7}{2}right)^3 + cleft(-frac{7}{2}right)^2 - 11left(-frac{7}{2}right) + 39 )Compute each term:First term: ( 2 times left(-frac{343}{8}right) = -frac{686}{8} = -frac{343}{4} ) ✔️Second term: ( c times frac{49}{4} = frac{49c}{4} ) ✔️Third term: ( -11 times -frac{7}{2} = frac{77}{2} ) ✔️Fourth term: 39 ✔️Convert all to quarters:- ( -frac{343}{4} )- ( frac{49c}{4} )- ( frac{154}{4} )- ( frac{156}{4} )Adding constants:-343 + 154 + 156 = (-343 + 154) + 156 = (-189) + 156 = -33 ✔️So, ( frac{49c}{4} - frac{33}{4} = 4 )Multiply both sides by 4: ( 49c - 33 = 16 )Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I converted 4 to ( frac{16}{4} ), which is correct, but when I added ( frac{16}{4} + frac{33}{4} ), that should be ( frac{49}{4} ), which is correct, and then multiplying both sides by 4 gives ( 49c = 49 ), so ( c = 1 ). So, that seems correct.Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when dealing with fractions, it's easy to make a mistake.So, starting from:( frac{49c}{4} - frac{33}{4} = 4 )Multiply both sides by 4:( 49c - 33 = 16 )Because 4 * 4 is 16.Then, add 33 to both sides:( 49c = 16 + 33 = 49 )So, ( c = 1 ). Yeah, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can use polynomial long division to verify.Let me try dividing ( 2x^3 + cx^2 - 11x + 39 ) by ( 2x + 7 ) and see what the remainder is, then set it equal to 4 and solve for ( c ).So, set up the division:Divide ( 2x^3 + cx^2 - 11x + 39 ) by ( 2x + 7 ).First term: ( 2x^3 ) divided by ( 2x ) is ( x^2 ). Multiply ( x^2 ) by ( 2x + 7 ):( x^2 times 2x = 2x^3 )( x^2 times 7 = 7x^2 )Subtract this from the original polynomial:( (2x^3 + cx^2 - 11x + 39) - (2x^3 + 7x^2) = (c - 7)x^2 - 11x + 39 )Next term: ( (c - 7)x^2 ) divided by ( 2x ) is ( frac{(c - 7)}{2}x ). Multiply this by ( 2x + 7 ):( frac{(c - 7)}{2}x times 2x = (c - 7)x^2 )( frac{(c - 7)}{2}x times 7 = frac{7(c - 7)}{2}x )Subtract this from the current polynomial:( [(c - 7)x^2 - 11x + 39] - [(c - 7)x^2 + frac{7(c - 7)}{2}x] = -11x - frac{7(c - 7)}{2}x + 39 )Combine like terms:The x terms: ( -11x - frac{7(c - 7)}{2}x = left(-11 - frac{7(c - 7)}{2}right)x )Let me compute that:First, write -11 as ( -frac{22}{2} ):( -frac{22}{2} - frac{7(c - 7)}{2} = frac{-22 - 7(c - 7)}{2} )Simplify numerator:-22 -7c + 49 = (-22 + 49) -7c = 27 -7cSo, the x term is ( frac{27 -7c}{2}x )So, now the current polynomial is ( frac{27 -7c}{2}x + 39 )Next term: ( frac{27 -7c}{2}x ) divided by ( 2x ) is ( frac{27 -7c}{4} ). Multiply this by ( 2x + 7 ):( frac{27 -7c}{4} times 2x = frac{27 -7c}{2}x )( frac{27 -7c}{4} times 7 = frac{189 -49c}{4} )Subtract this from the current polynomial:( left(frac{27 -7c}{2}x + 39right) - left(frac{27 -7c}{2}x + frac{189 -49c}{4}right) = 39 - frac{189 -49c}{4} )Simplify the constants:Convert 39 to fourths: ( 39 = frac{156}{4} )So,( frac{156}{4} - frac{189 -49c}{4} = frac{156 - 189 +49c}{4} = frac{-33 +49c}{4} )So, the remainder is ( frac{49c -33}{4} ). According to the problem, this should be equal to 4. So,( frac{49c -33}{4} = 4 )Multiply both sides by 4:( 49c -33 = 16 )Add 33 to both sides:( 49c = 49 )Divide both sides by 49:( c = 1 )Okay, so that confirms it. So, ( c = 1 ). Therefore, the constant ( c ) is 1.Just to make sure, let me plug ( c = 1 ) back into the original polynomial and perform the division to see if the remainder is indeed 4.Original polynomial: ( 2x^3 + x^2 -11x +39 )Divide by ( 2x +7 ).Using synthetic division might be quicker here. But since the divisor is ( 2x +7 ), which is not monic, I need to adjust.Alternatively, use polynomial long division.Alternatively, use substitution as before.Let me compute ( f(-7/2) ) with ( c=1 ):( f(-7/2) = 2*(-7/2)^3 + 1*(-7/2)^2 -11*(-7/2) +39 )Compute each term:First term: ( 2*(-343/8) = -686/8 = -343/4 )Second term: ( 1*(49/4) = 49/4 )Third term: ( -11*(-7/2) = 77/2 )Fourth term: 39Convert all to quarters:-343/4 + 49/4 + 154/4 + 156/4Add them up:(-343 + 49 + 154 + 156)/4Compute numerator:-343 +49 = -294-294 +154 = -140-140 +156 = 16So, total is 16/4 = 4. Perfect, that's the remainder. So, yes, when ( c=1 ), the remainder is 4. Therefore, ( c=1 ) is correct.I think that's thorough enough. I used two methods: substitution using the Remainder Theorem and polynomial long division, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that ( c=1 ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The constant ( c ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given tan alpha= frac {1}{7} and tan beta= frac {1}{3}, find tan (alpha+beta) and tan (alpha+2beta).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given that tan α is 1/7 and tan β is 1/3. I need to find tan(α + β) and tan(α + 2β). Hmm, I remember there are some tangent addition formulas for this. Let me try to recall.First, for tan(α + β), the formula is (tan α + tan β) divided by (1 - tan α tan β). Yeah, that sounds right. So, I can plug in the given values into this formula.Let me write that down:tan(α + β) = (tan α + tan β) / (1 - tan α tan β)Substituting the given values:tan(α + β) = (1/7 + 1/3) / (1 - (1/7)(1/3))Okay, let me compute the numerator first. 1/7 plus 1/3. To add these, I need a common denominator, which is 21.1/7 is 3/21 and 1/3 is 7/21. So, 3/21 + 7/21 is 10/21.Now, the denominator: 1 minus (1/7)(1/3). Let's compute the product first. 1/7 times 1/3 is 1/21. So, 1 - 1/21 is 20/21.So now, tan(α + β) is (10/21) divided by (20/21). Dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so 10/21 times 21/20. The 21s cancel out, and 10/20 simplifies to 1/2. So, tan(α + β) is 1/2.Alright, that seems straightforward. Now, moving on to tan(α + 2β). Hmm, this is a bit trickier because it's not just α + β, but α + 2β. I think I can approach this by first finding tan(2β) and then using the addition formula again with α and 2β.Let me recall the double angle formula for tangent. It is tan(2θ) = 2 tan θ / (1 - tan² θ). So, applying this to tan(2β):tan(2β) = 2 tan β / (1 - tan² β)Substituting tan β = 1/3:tan(2β) = 2*(1/3) / (1 - (1/3)²) = (2/3) / (1 - 1/9)Compute the denominator: 1 - 1/9 is 8/9.So, tan(2β) is (2/3) divided by (8/9). Again, dividing fractions is multiplying by reciprocal, so 2/3 * 9/8. Let's compute that: 2*9 is 18, and 3*8 is 24. So, 18/24 simplifies to 3/4. Therefore, tan(2β) is 3/4.Now, I need to find tan(α + 2β). Using the same addition formula as before:tan(α + 2β) = (tan α + tan 2β) / (1 - tan α tan 2β)We already know tan α is 1/7 and tan 2β is 3/4. Plugging these in:tan(α + 2β) = (1/7 + 3/4) / (1 - (1/7)(3/4))First, compute the numerator: 1/7 + 3/4. Common denominator is 28.1/7 is 4/28 and 3/4 is 21/28. So, 4/28 + 21/28 is 25/28.Now, the denominator: 1 - (1/7)(3/4). Compute the product first: 1/7 * 3/4 is 3/28. So, 1 - 3/28 is 25/28.So, tan(α + 2β) is (25/28) divided by (25/28). That simplifies to 1, since any number divided by itself is 1.Wait, that's interesting. So, tan(α + 2β) is 1. Hmm, that seems a bit too clean. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, tan(2β):tan(2β) = 2*(1/3)/(1 - (1/3)^2) = (2/3)/(8/9) = (2/3)*(9/8) = (18/24) = 3/4. That seems correct.Then, tan(α + 2β):(1/7 + 3/4)/(1 - (1/7)(3/4)) = (4/28 + 21/28)/(1 - 3/28) = (25/28)/(25/28) = 1. Yeah, that's correct.So, tan(α + 2β) is indeed 1. That makes sense because arctan(1) is π/4, so α + 2β is an angle whose tangent is 1, which is 45 degrees or π/4 radians.Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors.Starting with tan α = 1/7 and tan β = 1/3.First, tan(α + β):(1/7 + 1/3)/(1 - (1/7)(1/3)) = (10/21)/(20/21) = 1/2. Correct.Then, tan(2β):2*(1/3)/(1 - (1/3)^2) = (2/3)/(8/9) = 3/4. Correct.Then, tan(α + 2β):(1/7 + 3/4)/(1 - (1/7)(3/4)) = (25/28)/(25/28) = 1. Correct.So, I think both answers are correct. Therefore, tan(α + β) is 1/2 and tan(α + 2β) is 1.**Final Answer**The value of tan (alpha+beta) is boxed{dfrac{1}{2}} and the value of tan (alpha+2beta) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Calculate the limit of the function:lim _{x rightarrow 0} frac{sqrt{cos x}-1}{sin ^{2} 2 x}","answer":"Okay, so I have this limit to calculate: the limit as x approaches 0 of [sqrt(cos x) - 1] divided by sin²(2x). Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better.So, it's lim(x→0) [√(cos x) - 1] / [sin²(2x)]. Alright, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially when x approaches 0, we can often use Taylor series expansions or some standard limits to simplify things. Let me recall some of those.First, I know that as x approaches 0, cos x can be approximated by its Taylor series expansion. The expansion of cos x around 0 is 1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ... So, maybe I can use that to approximate sqrt(cos x). Hmm, sqrt(cos x) is the same as (cos x)^(1/2). So, perhaps I can expand that as well.Wait, another thought: maybe instead of expanding sqrt(cos x) directly, I can use a substitution. Let me set t = cos x. Then, as x approaches 0, t approaches cos 0 = 1. So, sqrt(t) - 1 over something. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe I can use the standard limit lim(x→0) [sqrt(1 + ax) - 1]/x, which is a/2. But in this case, it's sqrt(cos x) - 1, so maybe I can express cos x as 1 - something.Yes, cos x is approximately 1 - x²/2 for small x. So, sqrt(cos x) would be sqrt(1 - x²/2). Let me write that as sqrt(1 - (x²)/2). Now, I can use the binomial approximation for sqrt(1 - y) where y is small. The expansion is 1 - y/2 - y²/8 - ... So, substituting y = x²/2, we get sqrt(1 - x²/2) ≈ 1 - (x²)/4 - (x⁴)/32 - ...So, sqrt(cos x) - 1 ≈ [1 - (x²)/4 - (x⁴)/32 - ...] - 1 = -x²/4 - x⁴/32 - ... So, the numerator is approximately -x²/4 when x is near 0.Now, the denominator is sin²(2x). I know that sin(2x) can be approximated by its Taylor series as 2x - (8x³)/6 + ... So, sin(2x) ≈ 2x - (4x³)/3. Therefore, sin²(2x) would be approximately (2x)^2 = 4x², but let's do it more carefully.Wait, actually, sin(2x) ≈ 2x - (8x³)/6 + ... So, squaring that, sin²(2x) ≈ (2x)^2 + 2*(2x)*(-4x³/3) + ... which is 4x² - (16x⁴)/3 + ... So, the denominator is approximately 4x² when x is near 0.So, putting it all together, the numerator is approximately -x²/4 and the denominator is approximately 4x². Therefore, the whole expression is approximately (-x²/4) / (4x²) = (-1/4)/4 = -1/16.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If the numerator is -x²/4 and the denominator is 4x², then dividing them gives (-x²/4)/(4x²) = (-1/4)/4 = -1/16. So, the limit should be -1/16.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the expansion. Let's go through it again more carefully.First, cos x = 1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ... So, sqrt(cos x) = sqrt(1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ...). Let me denote this as sqrt(1 + a), where a = -x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ...The expansion of sqrt(1 + a) is 1 + (1/2)a - (1/8)a² + (1/16)a³ - ... So, substituting a:sqrt(1 + a) ≈ 1 + (1/2)(-x²/2 + x⁴/24) - (1/8)(-x²/2)^2 + ...Calculating term by term:First term: 1Second term: (1/2)*(-x²/2) = -x²/4Third term: (1/2)*(x⁴/24) = x⁴/48Fourth term: -(1/8)*(x⁴/4) = -x⁴/32So, combining these:sqrt(cos x) ≈ 1 - x²/4 + x⁴/48 - x⁴/32 + ... Let's combine the x⁴ terms:x⁴/48 - x⁴/32 = (2x⁴ - 3x⁴)/96 = (-x⁴)/96So, sqrt(cos x) ≈ 1 - x²/4 - x⁴/96 + ...Therefore, sqrt(cos x) - 1 ≈ -x²/4 - x⁴/96 + ...So, the numerator is approximately -x²/4.Now, the denominator is sin²(2x). Let's expand sin(2x):sin(2x) = 2x - (8x³)/6 + (32x⁵)/120 - ... = 2x - (4x³)/3 + (8x⁵)/15 - ...So, sin²(2x) = [2x - (4x³)/3 + ...]^2 = (2x)^2 + 2*(2x)*(-4x³/3) + (-4x³/3)^2 + ... = 4x² - (16x⁴)/3 + (16x⁶)/9 + ...So, sin²(2x) ≈ 4x² - (16x⁴)/3 + ...Therefore, the denominator is approximately 4x².So, putting numerator over denominator:(-x²/4) / (4x²) = (-1/4)/4 = -1/16.Wait, but hold on, in the numerator, the next term is -x⁴/96, and in the denominator, the next term is -16x⁴/3. So, if I include the next term, would that affect the limit?Let me see. If I write the numerator as -x²/4 - x⁴/96 + ... and the denominator as 4x² - 16x⁴/3 + ..., then the expression becomes:[-x²/4 - x⁴/96] / [4x² - 16x⁴/3] = [ -x²/4 (1 + x²/24) ] / [4x² (1 - 4x²/3) ].So, factoring out x² from numerator and denominator:= [ -1/4 (1 + x²/24) ] / [4 (1 - 4x²/3) ].As x approaches 0, the terms with x² in them go to 0, so the limit becomes (-1/4)/4 = -1/16.So, even considering the next term, the limit remains -1/16.Alternatively, another approach is to use L’Hospital’s Rule since both numerator and denominator approach 0 as x approaches 0. Let me check that.Compute the limit as x approaches 0 of [sqrt(cos x) - 1] / sin²(2x). Both numerator and denominator approach 0, so L’Hospital’s Rule applies. So, take derivatives of numerator and denominator.First, derivative of numerator: d/dx [sqrt(cos x) - 1] = (1/(2 sqrt(cos x))) * (-sin x) = (-sin x)/(2 sqrt(cos x)).Derivative of denominator: d/dx [sin²(2x)] = 2 sin(2x) * 2 cos(2x) = 4 sin(2x) cos(2x) = 2 sin(4x) using the double-angle identity.So, applying L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit becomes:lim(x→0) [ (-sin x)/(2 sqrt(cos x)) ] / [2 sin(4x)] = lim(x→0) [ (-sin x) / (2 sqrt(cos x)) ] * [1 / (2 sin(4x)) ] = lim(x→0) [ -sin x ] / [4 sqrt(cos x) sin(4x) ].Simplify this expression:= lim(x→0) [ -sin x ] / [4 sqrt(cos x) sin(4x) ].Now, as x approaches 0, sin x ≈ x, sin(4x) ≈ 4x, and sqrt(cos x) ≈ 1. So, substituting these approximations:≈ lim(x→0) [ -x ] / [4 * 1 * 4x ] = lim(x→0) [ -x ] / [16x ] = lim(x→0) -1/16 = -1/16.So, using L’Hospital’s Rule also gives the same result. Therefore, the limit is -1/16.Just to make sure, let me try another method, maybe using substitution or trigonometric identities.Alternatively, I can write sqrt(cos x) - 1 as [sqrt(cos x) - 1][sqrt(cos x) + 1] / [sqrt(cos x) + 1] = (cos x - 1) / [sqrt(cos x) + 1]. So, the numerator becomes (cos x - 1)/[sqrt(cos x) + 1].So, the original expression becomes [ (cos x - 1) / (sqrt(cos x) + 1) ] / sin²(2x) = (cos x - 1) / [ (sqrt(cos x) + 1) sin²(2x) ].Now, cos x - 1 = -2 sin²(x/2), so substituting that in:= [ -2 sin²(x/2) ] / [ (sqrt(cos x) + 1) sin²(2x) ].So, now, the expression is [ -2 sin²(x/2) ] / [ (sqrt(cos x) + 1) sin²(2x) ].Now, let's see if we can simplify this. Let's write sin²(2x) as [2 sin x cos x]^2 = 4 sin²x cos²x.So, sin²(2x) = 4 sin²x cos²x.Therefore, the expression becomes:[ -2 sin²(x/2) ] / [ (sqrt(cos x) + 1) * 4 sin²x cos²x ] = [ -2 sin²(x/2) ] / [4 (sqrt(cos x) + 1) sin²x cos²x ].Simplify constants: -2/4 = -1/2.So, now we have:-1/2 * [ sin²(x/2) ] / [ (sqrt(cos x) + 1) sin²x cos²x ].Now, let's express sin x in terms of sin(x/2). Recall that sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). So, sin²x = 4 sin²(x/2) cos²(x/2).So, substituting sin²x:= -1/2 * [ sin²(x/2) ] / [ (sqrt(cos x) + 1) * 4 sin²(x/2) cos²(x/2) * cos²x ].Simplify sin²(x/2) terms:= -1/2 * [ 1 ] / [ (sqrt(cos x) + 1) * 4 cos²(x/2) cos²x ].So, now we have:= -1/(8) * [ 1 ] / [ (sqrt(cos x) + 1) cos²(x/2) cos²x ].Now, as x approaches 0, cos x approaches 1, so sqrt(cos x) approaches 1, so sqrt(cos x) + 1 approaches 2. Also, cos(x/2) approaches 1, so cos²(x/2) approaches 1, and cos²x approaches 1.Therefore, the denominator approaches 2 * 1 * 1 = 2. So, the entire expression approaches:-1/8 * 1 / 2 = -1/16.Again, same result. So, using substitution and trigonometric identities also leads to the limit being -1/16.Just to recap, I've tried three methods:1. Taylor series expansion of numerator and denominator, leading to -1/16.2. L’Hospital’s Rule, taking derivatives and simplifying, also leading to -1/16.3. Substitution and trigonometric identities, again resulting in -1/16.All methods consistently give the same result, so I'm confident that the limit is indeed -1/16.**Final Answer**The limit is boxed{-dfrac{1}{16}}."},{"question":"A card game is played using several playing cards.

After these steps, Xiao Ming accurately states the current number of cards in the center pile. What do you think is the number of cards in the center pile now?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a card game that Xiao Ming and Xiao Liang are playing. Let me try to understand the steps and figure out how to solve it.First, the problem says that Xiao Ming is facing away from Xiao Liang, which probably means Xiao Ming can't see what Xiao Liang is doing, but he can figure out the number of cards in the center pile after some operations. So, the key is to figure out the number of cards in the center pile after these four steps.Let me break down the four steps:1. **Divide the cards into three piles: left, center, and right. Each pile has no fewer than two cards, and each pile has the same number of cards.**   So, initially, all three piles have the same number of cards, let's call this number 'n'. Each pile has at least two cards, so n ≥ 2.2. **Take two cards from the left pile and put them in the center pile.**   After this step, the left pile will have n - 2 cards, and the center pile will have n + 2 cards.3. **Take one card from the right pile and put it in the center pile.**   Now, the right pile will have n - 1 cards, and the center pile will have n + 2 + 1 = n + 3 cards.4. **Take the same number of cards as there are in the left pile from the center pile and put them into the left pile.**   At this point, the left pile has n - 2 cards. So, we take (n - 2) cards from the center pile and put them back into the left pile.   Let me compute how many cards each pile will have after this step.   - Left pile: (n - 2) + (n - 2) = 2n - 4   - Center pile: (n + 3) - (n - 2) = n + 3 - n + 2 = 5   - Right pile remains at n - 1 cards.So, after all four steps, the center pile has 5 cards. That seems straightforward, but let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with each pile having n cards:1. After step 2: Left = n - 2, Center = n + 2, Right = n2. After step 3: Left = n - 2, Center = n + 3, Right = n - 13. After step 4: We take (n - 2) from Center and give to Left.So, Left becomes (n - 2) + (n - 2) = 2n - 4Center becomes (n + 3) - (n - 2) = 5Right remains at n - 1So, regardless of the initial number of cards per pile (as long as each pile has at least two cards), the center pile will always end up with 5 cards.Wait, that seems too simple. Let me test it with a specific number.Suppose each pile starts with 3 cards (minimum allowed is 2, so 3 is a good test).1. Start: Left=3, Center=3, Right=32. Step 2: Left=1, Center=5, Right=33. Step 3: Left=1, Center=6, Right=24. Step 4: Take 1 card from Center to Left. So, Left=2, Center=5, Right=2Yes, center pile is 5.Another test with n=4:1. Start: 4,4,42. Step 2: 2,6,43. Step 3: 2,7,34. Step 4: Take 2 from Center to Left: Left=4, Center=5, Right=3Again, center pile is 5.Wait, so regardless of the initial number, as long as each pile has the same number of cards and at least two, the center pile will end up with 5 cards.Therefore, Xiao Ming can confidently say that the center pile has 5 cards.I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The number of cards in the center pile now is boxed{5}."},{"question":"Calculate the limit of the function:[lim _{x rightarrow 2} frac{operatorname{arctg}left(x^{2}-2 xright)}{sin 3 pi x}]","answer":"Alright, so I have this limit problem to solve:[lim _{x rightarrow 2} frac{operatorname{arctg}left(x^{2}-2 xright)}{sin 3 pi x}]Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially as x approaches a certain value, I should check if directly substituting the value gives me an indeterminate form like 0/0 or ∞/∞. If it does, then I might need to use L'Hôpital's Rule or some other method.So, let me try substituting x = 2 into both the numerator and the denominator.Starting with the numerator: arctg(x² - 2x). Plugging in x = 2, we get arctg(2² - 2*2) = arctg(4 - 4) = arctg(0). I remember that arctg(0) is 0 because tangent of 0 is 0. So, the numerator becomes 0.Now, the denominator: sin(3πx). Plugging in x = 2, we have sin(3π*2) = sin(6π). I know that sin(6π) is 0 because sine of any integer multiple of π is 0. So, the denominator is also 0.So, substituting x = 2 directly gives me 0/0, which is an indeterminate form. That means I can apply L'Hôpital's Rule here. L'Hôpital's Rule states that if the limit of f(x)/g(x) as x approaches a is an indeterminate form of 0/0 or ∞/∞, then it's equal to the limit of f'(x)/g'(x) as x approaches a, provided that this latter limit exists.Alright, so I need to find the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator.First, let's find the derivative of the numerator: arctg(x² - 2x). The derivative of arctg(u) with respect to x is (1/(1 + u²)) * du/dx. So, here, u = x² - 2x, so du/dx = 2x - 2. Therefore, the derivative of the numerator is (1/(1 + (x² - 2x)²)) * (2x - 2).Now, the derivative of the denominator: sin(3πx). The derivative of sin(u) with respect to x is cos(u) * du/dx. Here, u = 3πx, so du/dx = 3π. Therefore, the derivative of the denominator is cos(3πx) * 3π.So, applying L'Hôpital's Rule, the limit becomes:[lim _{x rightarrow 2} frac{frac{2x - 2}{1 + (x^{2} - 2x)^{2}}}{3pi cos(3pi x)}]Simplify this expression:[lim _{x rightarrow 2} frac{2x - 2}{3pi cos(3pi x) left(1 + (x^{2} - 2x)^{2}right)}]Now, let's substitute x = 2 into this new expression to see if we can evaluate the limit directly.First, compute the numerator: 2x - 2. Plugging in x = 2, we get 2*2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.Next, the denominator: 3π cos(3πx) [1 + (x² - 2x)²]. Let's compute each part step by step.First, cos(3πx) when x = 2: cos(3π*2) = cos(6π). Cosine of 6π is 1 because cosine has a period of 2π, so cos(6π) = cos(0) = 1.Next, compute (x² - 2x)² when x = 2: (2² - 2*2)² = (4 - 4)² = 0² = 0. Therefore, 1 + 0 = 1.So, putting it all together, the denominator is 3π * 1 * 1 = 3π.Therefore, the limit simplifies to 2 / (3π).Wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check that. The numerator after substitution is 2, and the denominator is 3π * 1 * 1, which is 3π. So yes, the limit is 2/(3π).But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify each step.First, the substitution into the original function: arctg(0)/sin(6π) = 0/0, correct. So L'Hôpital's Rule applies.Derivative of numerator: derivative of arctg(u) is 1/(1 + u²) * du/dx. u = x² - 2x, du/dx = 2x - 2. So that's correct.Derivative of denominator: derivative of sin(u) is cos(u) * du/dx. u = 3πx, du/dx = 3π. So that's correct.Then, substituting x = 2 into the derivatives:Numerator derivative: 2x - 2 = 2*2 - 2 = 2, correct.Denominator derivative: 3π cos(6π) [1 + (0)^2] = 3π * 1 * 1 = 3π, correct.So, 2 / (3π) is indeed the limit.Alternatively, just to explore another method, maybe expanding the functions around x = 2 using Taylor series or something? But since we already got the result using L'Hôpital's Rule, which is straightforward, I think that's sufficient.Wait, another thought: sometimes, when dealing with trigonometric functions in the denominator, especially sine, near points where sine is zero, we can use the approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ when θ is near zero. But in this case, as x approaches 2, 3πx approaches 6π, which is not near zero. So that approximation might not be directly applicable here.Alternatively, maybe we can make a substitution to shift the variable so that the point of interest is at zero. Let me try that.Let’s set t = x - 2. Then, as x approaches 2, t approaches 0. So, rewrite the original limit in terms of t.First, x = t + 2.Compute numerator: arctg((t + 2)^2 - 2(t + 2)) = arctg(t² + 4t + 4 - 2t - 4) = arctg(t² + 2t).Denominator: sin(3π(t + 2)) = sin(3πt + 6π). Since sin(θ + 2πk) = sinθ for integer k, and 6π is 3*2π, so sin(3πt + 6π) = sin(3πt).So, the limit becomes:[lim _{t rightarrow 0} frac{operatorname{arctg}(t^{2} + 2t)}{sin 3pi t}]Hmm, that might be a useful substitution because now t approaches 0, and we can use small angle approximations.I know that for small t, sin(3πt) ≈ 3πt. Similarly, arctg(z) ≈ z when z is near 0.So, let's see: arctg(t² + 2t) ≈ t² + 2t, since t is approaching 0, so t² is negligible compared to 2t. So, approximately, arctg(t² + 2t) ≈ 2t.Therefore, the numerator is approximately 2t, and the denominator is approximately 3πt.So, the ratio is approximately (2t)/(3πt) = 2/(3π). So, that's consistent with what I got earlier using L'Hôpital's Rule.Therefore, this alternative method also gives me the same result, which is reassuring.Just to make sure, let me compute the limit numerically by plugging in values close to 2 and see if it approaches 2/(3π).Let’s choose x = 2.001:Compute numerator: arctg((2.001)^2 - 2*2.001) = arctg(4.004001 - 4.002) = arctg(0.002001) ≈ 0.002001 (since arctg(z) ≈ z for small z).Denominator: sin(3π*2.001) = sin(6π + 0.003π) = sin(0.003π) ≈ 0.003π (since sin(z) ≈ z for small z).So, the ratio is approximately 0.002001 / 0.003π ≈ (0.002001)/(0.00942477) ≈ 0.212.Now, 2/(3π) ≈ 2/9.42477 ≈ 0.212. So, that's consistent.Similarly, if I take x = 1.999:Numerator: arctg((1.999)^2 - 2*1.999) = arctg(3.996001 - 3.998) = arctg(-0.001999) ≈ -0.001999.Denominator: sin(3π*1.999) = sin(5.997π) = sin(6π - 0.003π) = sin(-0.003π) ≈ -0.003π.So, the ratio is (-0.001999)/(-0.003π) ≈ 0.001999 / 0.00942477 ≈ 0.212, same as before.So, numerically, it's approaching approximately 0.212, which is 2/(3π) ≈ 0.2122116.Therefore, all methods point to the same result.So, after carefully going through substitution, L'Hôpital's Rule, an alternative substitution with Taylor series approximation, and numerical verification, I can confidently say that the limit is 2/(3π).**Final Answer**The limit is boxed{dfrac{2}{3pi}}."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},z={key:1};function j(a,e,h,d,s,n){const u=b("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 DeepSeek-R1 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),p(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>s.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[g,s.searchQuery]])]),t("div",C,[(i(!0),o(w,null,y(n.filteredPoems,(r,f)=>(i(),x(u,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},[s.isLoading?(i(),o("span",z,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):v("",!0)])}const O=m(L,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-54293b1f"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/51.md","filePath":"guide/51.md"}'),R={name:"guide/51.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(i(),o("div",null,[S(O)]))}});export{H as __pageData,E as default};
