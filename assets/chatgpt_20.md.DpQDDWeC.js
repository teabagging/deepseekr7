Therefore, Boxer B's accuracy is (100 / 200) * 100 = 50%.For the second match:- Boxer C threw 180 punches and landed 90. Thus, Boxer C's accuracy is (90 / 180) * 100 = 50%.- Boxer D threw 150 punches and landed 75. Hence, Boxer D's accuracy is (75 / 150) * 100 = 50%.Next, I will find the average accuracy percentage for all four boxers. Adding up all the accuracy percentages: 50% + 50% + 50% + 50% = 200%. Then, dividing this total by the number of boxers, which is 4: 200% / 4 = 50%.Therefore, the average accuracy percentage for all the boxers in these two matches combined is 50%."},{"question":"Mrs. Thompson, an experienced English teacher, wants to demonstrate the importance of storytelling by organizing a special class project.

If Sarah is currently 12 weeks pregnant and her doctor wants her to have ultrasounds until she reaches 36 weeks, how many more ultrasounds does Sarah need to schedule?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of weeks between Sarah's current pregnancy week and the week when she should stop having ultrasounds. Sarah is currently at 12 weeks and needs to continue until 36 weeks.Next, I'll calculate the difference in weeks: 36 weeks minus 12 weeks equals 24 weeks.Since Sarah is required to have an ultrasound every 4 weeks, I'll divide the total number of weeks by the interval between ultrasounds: 24 weeks divided by 4 weeks per ultrasound equals 6 ultrasounds.However, it's important to consider whether the initial ultrasound at 12 weeks counts toward the total. If it does, then the number of additional ultrasounds needed would be 5. If not, the total remains 6.Therefore, Sarah needs to schedule either 5 or 6 more ultrasounds, depending on whether the current 12-week ultrasound is included in the count."},{"question":"An architecture critic attends an acrobatic performance where the stage is a square platform with a side length of 20 meters. The performers use half of the stage to create a rectangular space for their routine, which is 15 meters long. The remaining part of the stage is used for props and equipment. If the performers need 3 square meters of space for each acrobat, how many acrobats can perform on the rectangular space simultaneously?","answer":"First, I need to determine the area of the entire square stage. Since each side is 20 meters, the area is 20 meters multiplied by 20 meters, which equals 400 square meters.Next, the performers use half of this stage for their rectangular space.

You have collected data on their rowing speeds over a 2000-meter race under various conditions. Consider the following:1. The rowing speed ( v(t) ) of the team in meters per second (m/s) at time ( t ) seconds is given by the function ( v(t) = 5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2 ), where ( t ) ranges from 0 to 200 seconds.2. In addition, you have observed that the wind resistance affects the team's performance. The wind resistance force ( F(t) ) in newtons (N) at time ( t ) seconds is given by ( F(t) = 0.5v(t)^2 ).Sub-problems:1. Determine the total distance covered by the team during the 2000-meter race. Verify if the distance covered by ( v(t) ) integrates to 2000 meters over the time interval [0, 200] seconds.2. Calculate the work done against the wind resistance over the entire race. Recall that the work done ( W ) against a force ( F(t) ) over a distance ( x(t) ) can be found by integrating the product of the force and the instantaneous velocity, i.e., ( W = int_0^{200} F(t) cdot v(t) , dt ).Note: Use integral calculus to solve both sub-problems.","answer":"Alright, so I've got this problem about analyzing the performance of a Thai rowing team. I'm supposed to figure out two things: first, whether the total distance they covered in 200 seconds is exactly 2000 meters, and second, calculate the work done against wind resistance during the race. Let me try to break this down step by step.Starting with the first sub-problem: determining the total distance covered. I remember that distance is the integral of velocity over time. The velocity function given is ( v(t) = 5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2 ). So, to find the total distance, I need to integrate this velocity function from time ( t = 0 ) to ( t = 200 ) seconds.Let me write that down:[text{Distance} = int_{0}^{200} v(t) , dt = int_{0}^{200} left(5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2right) dt]Okay, so I need to compute this integral. Let me recall how to integrate polynomials term by term. The integral of a constant is the constant times time, the integral of ( t ) is ( frac{1}{2}t^2 ), and the integral of ( t^2 ) is ( frac{1}{3}t^3 ). So applying that here:First term: ( int 5 , dt = 5t )Second term: ( int 0.02t , dt = 0.02 cdot frac{1}{2} t^2 = 0.01t^2 )Third term: ( int -0.0001t^2 , dt = -0.0001 cdot frac{1}{3} t^3 = -frac{0.0001}{3} t^3 )Putting it all together, the antiderivative ( V(t) ) is:[V(t) = 5t + 0.01t^2 - frac{0.0001}{3} t^3 + C]Since we're calculating a definite integral from 0 to 200, the constant ( C ) will cancel out, so we can ignore it.Now, let's compute ( V(200) - V(0) ):First, compute each term at ( t = 200 ):1. ( 5 times 200 = 1000 )2. ( 0.01 times (200)^2 = 0.01 times 40000 = 400 )3. ( frac{0.0001}{3} times (200)^3 = frac{0.0001}{3} times 8,000,000 )Wait, let me compute that third term carefully. ( (200)^3 = 8,000,000 ). So:( frac{0.0001}{3} times 8,000,000 = frac{0.0001 times 8,000,000}{3} = frac{800}{3} approx 266.6667 )But since the term is negative, it becomes ( -266.6667 ).So, adding up the three terms at ( t = 200 ):1000 + 400 - 266.6667 = 1133.3333 meters.Now, at ( t = 0 ), all terms are zero, so ( V(0) = 0 ).Therefore, the total distance is approximately 1133.3333 meters. Wait, that's way less than 2000 meters. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?Let me double-check the integral. Maybe I messed up the coefficients.The velocity function is ( v(t) = 5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2 ). So integrating term by term:First term: ( 5t ) is correct.Second term: ( 0.02t ) integrated is ( 0.01t^2 ), that's correct.Third term: ( -0.0001t^2 ) integrated is ( -0.0000333333t^3 ). Wait, is that right? Because ( frac{0.0001}{3} ) is approximately 0.0000333333.So, when I compute the third term at ( t = 200 ):( -0.0000333333 times (200)^3 = -0.0000333333 times 8,000,000 )Calculating that: 0.0000333333 * 8,000,000 = 266.6664 approximately. So, yes, that's correct.So, 5t at 200 is 1000, 0.01t² is 400, and the last term is -266.6667.So, 1000 + 400 = 1400; 1400 - 266.6667 = 1133.3333 meters.Wait, but the race is supposed to be 2000 meters. So, according to this, the team only covered about 1133 meters in 200 seconds. That seems way too short. Did I misinterpret the velocity function?Let me check the velocity function again: ( v(t) = 5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2 ). So, at t=0, the velocity is 5 m/s, which is pretty fast for rowing, but maybe it's okay. Let's see how the velocity changes over time.At t=200, the velocity would be:( v(200) = 5 + 0.02*200 - 0.0001*(200)^2 )Compute each term:0.02*200 = 40.0001*(200)^2 = 0.0001*40000 = 4So, v(200) = 5 + 4 - 4 = 5 m/s.So, the velocity starts at 5 m/s, increases to a maximum, then decreases back to 5 m/s at 200 seconds.Wait, so the velocity function is a quadratic, opening downward, since the coefficient of ( t^2 ) is negative. So, it should have a maximum somewhere in between.Let me find the time when the velocity is maximum. The vertex of a parabola ( at^2 + bt + c ) is at ( t = -b/(2a) ).Here, ( a = -0.0001 ), ( b = 0.02 ). So,( t = -0.02 / (2 * -0.0001) = -0.02 / (-0.0002) = 100 ) seconds.So, the maximum velocity occurs at t=100 seconds.Compute v(100):( v(100) = 5 + 0.02*100 - 0.0001*(100)^2 )= 5 + 2 - 1 = 6 m/s.So, the velocity increases from 5 m/s to 6 m/s at 100 seconds, then decreases back to 5 m/s at 200 seconds.So, the average velocity over the 200 seconds is... Well, the integral gave us approximately 1133 meters, which is way less than 2000. So, this suggests that either the velocity function is incorrect, or the time interval is not 200 seconds for a 2000-meter race.Wait, hold on. Maybe the 2000-meter race is not 200 seconds? Or perhaps the velocity function is given for 200 seconds, but the actual race is longer? Hmm, the problem says \\"over a 2000-meter race under various conditions,\\" and the velocity function is given for t from 0 to 200 seconds. So, perhaps the 2000 meters is the total distance, and we need to check if integrating v(t) from 0 to 200 gives 2000 meters.But according to my calculation, it's only about 1133 meters. So, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the integral.Wait, let me recalculate the integral step by step.Compute ( int_{0}^{200} (5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2) dt )First, integrate term by term:- Integral of 5 dt = 5t- Integral of 0.02t dt = 0.01t²- Integral of -0.0001t² dt = -0.0000333333t³So, the antiderivative is:5t + 0.01t² - (0.0000333333)t³Now, evaluate from 0 to 200:At t=200:5*200 = 10000.01*(200)^2 = 0.01*40000 = 4000.0000333333*(200)^3 = 0.0000333333*8,000,000 = 266.66664So, putting it all together:1000 + 400 - 266.66664 = 1133.33336 meters.Yes, that's correct. So, the total distance is approximately 1133.33 meters, which is less than 2000 meters. So, that suggests that either the time interval is longer, or the velocity function is different.But the problem states that t ranges from 0 to 200 seconds. So, perhaps the question is to verify whether the integral equals 2000 meters, which it doesn't. So, the answer to the first sub-problem is that the total distance covered is approximately 1133.33 meters, which is less than 2000 meters. Therefore, the distance covered by v(t) does not integrate to 2000 meters over [0, 200] seconds.Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity function. Let me check the units. The velocity is given in m/s, so integrating over seconds should give meters. So, that's correct.Alternatively, perhaps the velocity function is supposed to be in km/h or something else? But the problem says m/s, so I think that's correct.Alternatively, maybe the function is given as ( v(t) = 5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2 ), but perhaps it's supposed to be in a different unit or scaled differently.Alternatively, maybe I need to find the time when the distance becomes 2000 meters, but the problem says t ranges from 0 to 200 seconds, so I think the first sub-problem is just to compute the integral and see if it's 2000, which it isn't.So, moving on to the second sub-problem: calculating the work done against wind resistance. The wind resistance force is given by ( F(t) = 0.5v(t)^2 ). Work done is the integral of F(t) * v(t) dt from 0 to 200.So, first, let's write down the expression for work:[W = int_{0}^{200} F(t) cdot v(t) , dt = int_{0}^{200} 0.5v(t)^2 cdot v(t) , dt = int_{0}^{200} 0.5v(t)^3 , dt]So, we need to compute ( int_{0}^{200} 0.5v(t)^3 , dt ).Given that ( v(t) = 5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2 ), so ( v(t)^3 ) will be a bit complicated to compute. Let me write that out:( v(t)^3 = (5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2)^3 )Expanding this would be quite tedious, as it's a cubic of a quadratic. Let me see if there's a smarter way or if I can use substitution or something.Alternatively, maybe I can compute this integral numerically, but since this is a calculus problem, perhaps there's an exact method.Alternatively, perhaps I can express ( v(t) ) in a different form to make the integration easier. Let me see:( v(t) = 5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2 )Let me factor out 0.0001 to make it easier:( v(t) = 5 + 0.02t - 0.0001t^2 = 5 + 0.02t - (0.0001)t^2 )Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:( v(t) = -0.0001t^2 + 0.02t + 5 )Which is a quadratic function. So, ( v(t) = at^2 + bt + c ), where a = -0.0001, b = 0.02, c = 5.So, ( v(t)^3 = (at^2 + bt + c)^3 ). Expanding this would result in a polynomial of degree 6, which is going to be a lot of terms. But perhaps manageable.Let me recall the formula for expanding ( (x + y + z)^3 ). It's ( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3x^2y + 3x^2z + 3xy^2 + 3xz^2 + 3y^2z + 3yz^2 + 6xyz ). So, applying that here, with x = at^2, y = bt, z = c.So,( v(t)^3 = (at^2)^3 + (bt)^3 + c^3 + 3(at^2)^2(bt) + 3(at^2)^2(c) + 3(at^2)(bt)^2 + 3(at^2)(c)^2 + 3(bt)^2(c) + 3(bt)(c)^2 + 6(at^2)(bt)(c) )That's a lot of terms, but let's compute each one step by step.First, let me note that a = -0.0001, b = 0.02, c = 5.Compute each term:1. ( (at^2)^3 = a^3 t^6 = (-0.0001)^3 t^6 = -1e-12 t^6 )2. ( (bt)^3 = b^3 t^3 = (0.02)^3 t^3 = 0.000008 t^3 )3. ( c^3 = 5^3 = 125 )4. ( 3(at^2)^2(bt) = 3a^2b t^5 = 3*(-0.0001)^2*0.02 t^5 = 3*(0.00000001)*0.02 t^5 = 3*0.0000000002 t^5 = 0.0000000006 t^5 )5. ( 3(at^2)^2(c) = 3a^2c t^4 = 3*(-0.0001)^2*5 t^4 = 3*(0.00000001)*5 t^4 = 0.00000015 t^4 )6. ( 3(at^2)(bt)^2 = 3ab^2 t^4 = 3*(-0.0001)*(0.02)^2 t^4 = 3*(-0.0001)*0.0004 t^4 = -0.00000012 t^4 )7. ( 3(at^2)(c)^2 = 3ac^2 t^2 = 3*(-0.0001)*(5)^2 t^2 = 3*(-0.0001)*25 t^2 = -0.0075 t^2 )8. ( 3(bt)^2(c) = 3b^2c t^2 = 3*(0.02)^2*5 t^2 = 3*0.0004*5 t^2 = 0.006 t^2 )9.

Now, we need to integrate this multiplied by 0.5 from 0 to 200.So, ( W = 0.5 int_{0}^{200} v(t)^3 dt = 0.5 times int_{0}^{200} [ -1e-12 t^6 + 0.0000000006 t^5 + 0.00000003 t^4 + 0.000002 t^3 - 0.0015 t^2 + 1.5 t + 125 ] dt )Let me compute the integral term by term.First, write down the integral:[int_{0}^{200} [ -1e-12 t^6 + 0.0000000006 t^5 + 0.00000003 t^4 + 0.000002 t^3 - 0.0015 t^2 + 1.5 t + 125 ] dt]Integrate each term:1.

( int 125 dt = 125t )Now, let's compute each term at t=200 and subtract the value at t=0 (which is zero for all terms except the last one, but since we're integrating from 0, it's just the value at 200).Compute each term at t=200:1.

Let me check the units. The integral of ( v(t)^3 ) would be in (m/s)^3 * s = m^3/s^2, which doesn't make physical sense. Wait, no, actually, the work done is in joules, which is force times distance, and force is in newtons, which is kg*m/s². So, work is in joules = kg*m²/s².But in our case, ( F(t) = 0.5v(t)^2 ), so the units of F(t) would be 0.5*(m/s)^2, which is m²/s². Then, work is F(t)*v(t)*dt, so units are m²/s² * m/s * s = m³/s. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I messed up the units.Wait, actually, work is force times distance, so if F(t) is in newtons, and distance is in meters, then work is in joules. But in our case, F(t) is given as 0.5v(t)^2, which is in (m/s)^2, but that's not a force. Wait, that can't be right. Force should be in newtons, which is kg*m/s².Wait, hold on. The problem says the wind resistance force ( F(t) = 0.5v(t)^2 ). But that would have units of (m/s)^2, which is not a force. That seems incorrect. Typically, wind resistance force is proportional to the square of velocity, but with a coefficient that has units of kg/m. So, perhaps the given F(t) is actually ( F(t) = 0.5 rho A C_d v(t)^2 ), where ( rho ) is air density, A is cross-sectional area, and C_d is drag coefficient. But in this problem, it's given as ( F(t) = 0.5v(t)^2 ), which is dimensionally inconsistent because force should have units of kg*m/s², but v(t)^2 has units of m²/s², so 0.5v(t)^2 would have units of m²/s², which is not a force.Wait, perhaps the 0.5 is actually a coefficient that includes the necessary units. Maybe it's 0.5 kg/m, so that F(t) = 0.5 kg/m * v(t)^2 m²/s² = 0.5 kg/m * m²/s² = 0.5 kg*m/s² = newtons. So, maybe the 0.5 is actually 0.5 kg/m, making F(t) a force.But the problem states ( F(t) = 0.5v(t)^2 ), without specifying units for the 0.5. So, perhaps it's just a given function, and we can proceed with the calculation as is, assuming that the units work out.So, moving forward, the integral of ( v(t)^3 ) is approximately 51,891.435, and then we multiply by 0.5 to get the work done:( W = 0.5 * 51,891.435 ≈ 25,945.7175 ) joules.So, approximately 25,945.72 joules.But let me check if that makes sense. Given that the velocity is around 5-6 m/s, the force would be 0.5*(5)^2 = 12.5 N to 0.5*(6)^2 = 18 N. Over 200 seconds, the work done would be force times distance, but since force varies with velocity, it's better to integrate.But 25,945 joules seems plausible. Let me see:Average force: Let's say average velocity is around (5 + 6)/2 = 5.5 m/s. So, average force would be 0.5*(5.5)^2 ≈ 0.5*30.25 ≈ 15.125 N.Total distance is approximately 1133 meters, so work done would be force * distance ≈ 15.125 N * 1133 m ≈ 17,000 joules. But our integral gave us about 25,945 joules, which is higher. That discrepancy suggests that maybe my assumption about average force is incorrect because the force isn't constant; it varies with velocity, which is higher in the middle.Wait, the velocity starts at 5, goes up to 6, then back to 5. So, the force starts at 0.5*25=12.5 N, goes up to 0.5*36=18 N, then back to 12.5 N. So, the force is higher in the middle, which would mean that the average force is higher than 15.125 N. So, 25,945 joules might be correct.Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact integral without approximating each term.Wait, let me see if I can compute the integral more accurately.Looking back at the integral:[int_{0}^{200} v(t)^3 dt = int_{0}^{200} [ -1e-12 t^6 + 0.0000000006 t^5 + 0.00000003 t^4 + 0.000002 t^3 - 0.0015 t^2 + 1.5 t + 125 ] dt]But perhaps instead of approximating each term, I can compute each term more precisely.Let me recompute each term with more precision.1. ( -1e-12 cdot frac{200^7}{7} )200^7 = 12,800,000,000,000,000Divide by 7: 12,800,000,000,000,000 / 7 ≈ 1,828,571,428,571,428.571Multiply by -1e-12: -1,828,571,428,571,428.571 * 1e-12 ≈ -1,828.571428571428571So, term1 ≈ -1828.57142857142862. ( 0.0000000006 cdot frac{200^6}{6} )200^6 = 64,000,000,000,000Divide by 6: 64,000,000,000,000 / 6 ≈ 10,666,666,666,666.666...Multiply by 0.0000000006: 10,666,666,666,666.666... * 0.0000000006 = 6.4So, term2 = 6.4Wait, earlier I thought it was 0.0064, but that was a miscalculation. Wait, 0.0000000006 is 6e-10.So, 6e-10 * 10,666,666,666,666.666... = 6e-10 * 1.0666666666666666e+13 = 6 * 1.0666666666666666e+3 = 6 * 1066.6666666666666 ≈ 6400Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 6e-10 * 1.0666666666666666e+13:6e-10 * 1.0666666666666666e+13 = 6 * 1.0666666666666666e+3 = 6 * 1066.6666666666666 ≈ 6400Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. So, term2 is actually 6400, not 0.0064.Wait, I think I messed up the exponent earlier. Let me clarify:0.0000000006 is 6e-10.200^6 = 64,000,000,000,000 = 6.4e13Divide by 6: 6.4e13 / 6 ≈ 1.0666666666666666e13Multiply by 6e-10: 1.0666666666666666e13 * 6e-10 = (1.0666666666666666 * 6) * 10^(13-10) = 6.4 * 10^3 = 6400So, term2 = 6400That's a big difference from my previous 0.0064. I must have misplaced the decimal point earlier.Similarly, let's recompute term3:3. ( 0.00000003 cdot frac{200^5}{5} )200^5 = 320,000,000,000 = 3.2e11Divide by 5: 3.2e11 / 5 = 6.4e10Multiply by 0.00000003: 6.4e10 * 3e-8 = (6.4 * 3) * 10^(10-8) = 19.2 * 10^2 = 1920So, term3 = 19204. ( 0.000002 cdot frac{200^4}{4} )200^4 = 1,600,000,000 = 1.6e9Divide by 4: 1.6e9 / 4 = 4e8Multiply by 0.000002: 4e8 * 2e-6 = 800term4 = 8005. ( -0.0015 cdot frac{200^3}{3} )200^3 = 8,000,000 = 8e6Divide by 3: 8e6 / 3 ≈ 2.6666666666666666e6Multiply by -0.0015: -0.0015 * 2.6666666666666666e6 ≈ -4,000term5 = -40006. ( 1.5 cdot frac{200^2}{2} )200^2 = 40,000Divide by 2: 20,000Multiply by 1.5: 30,000term6 = 30,0007. ( 125 * 200 = 25,000 )term7 = 25,000Now, let's add them up again with the corrected term2:term1: -1828.5714285714286term2: +6400term3: +1920term4: +800term5: -4000term6: +30,000term7: +25,000Compute step by step:Start with term1: -1828.5714Add term2: -1828.5714 + 6400 ≈ 4571.4286Add term3: 4571.4286 + 1920 ≈ 6491.4286Add term4: 6491.4286 + 800 ≈ 7291.4286Add term5: 7291.4286 - 4000 ≈ 3291.4286Add term6: 3291.4286 + 30,000 ≈ 33,291.4286Add term7: 33,291.4286 + 25,000 ≈ 58,291.4286So, the integral of ( v(t)^3 ) from 0 to 200 is approximately 58,291.4286.Then, the work done is 0.5 times that:( W = 0.5 * 58,291.4286 ≈ 29,145.7143 ) joules.So, approximately 29,145.71 joules.Wait, that's a significant difference from my previous calculation because I had incorrectly calculated term2 as 0.0064 instead of 6400. So, the correct integral is about 58,291.43, leading to W ≈ 29,145.71 J.But let me double-check term2 again because that was the source of the error.Term2: ( 0.0000000006 cdot frac{200^6}{6} )200^6 = 64,000,000,000,000 = 6.4e13Divide by 6: 6.4e13 / 6 ≈ 1.0666666666666666e13Multiply by 0.0000000006: 1.0666666666666666e13 * 6e-10 = (1.0666666666666666 * 6) * 10^(13-10) = 6.4 * 10^3 = 6400Yes, that's correct. So, term2 is indeed 6400.Therefore, the corrected integral is approximately 58,291.43, leading to W ≈ 29,145.71 J.But let me check if this makes sense. Given that the force varies from 12.5 N to 18 N, and the distance is about 1133 meters, the work done should be somewhere between 12.5*1133 ≈ 14,162.5 J and 18*1133 ≈ 20,394 J. But our calculation gave us about 29,145 J, which is higher than both. That suggests that perhaps the force isn't just varying between 12.5 and 18 N, but actually, because the velocity is squared, the force is higher when velocity is higher, and since the velocity peaks at 6 m/s, the force peaks at 18 N, but the average force might be higher than the simple average.Wait, but actually, the integral of force over distance is equal to the work done. Since the force is not constant, we can't just take the average force as (12.5 + 18)/2. Instead, we have to integrate F(t) * v(t) dt, which we did.But let me compute the exact value of the integral without approximating:The integral of ( v(t)^3 ) is:-1828.5714285714286 + 6400 + 1920 + 800 - 4000 + 30,000 + 25,000Compute step by step:Start with -1828.5714Add 6400: 6400 - 1828.5714 ≈ 4571.4286Add 1920: 4571.4286 + 1920 = 6491.4286Add 800: 6491.4286 + 800 = 7291.4286Subtract 4000: 7291.4286 - 4000 = 3291.4286Add 30,000: 3291.4286 + 30,000 = 33,291.4286Add 25,000: 33,291.4286 + 25,000 = 58,291.4286So, the integral is exactly 58,291.42857142857, which is 58,291.42857142857.Multiplying by 0.5 gives:58,291.42857142857 * 0.5 = 29,145.714285714285So, W ≈ 29,145.71 J.Therefore, the work done against wind resistance is approximately 29,145.71 joules.But let me check if there's a smarter way to compute this integral without expanding ( v(t)^3 ). Perhaps using substitution or recognizing a pattern.Given that ( v(t) = -0.0001t^2 + 0.02t + 5 ), and we need to compute ( int v(t)^3 dt ). It's a cubic of a quadratic, which is a sixth-degree polynomial, so integrating term by term is the way to go, but perhaps there's a formula or a reduction formula.Alternatively, perhaps using the binomial theorem for expansion, but it's the same as what I did earlier.Alternatively, perhaps using substitution u = v(t), but since v(t) is quadratic, du/dt = -0.0002t + 0.02, which doesn't directly help because the integral involves v(t)^3 * dt, and we can't express dt in terms of du without complicating things.So, I think expanding ( v(t)^3 ) and integrating term by term is the correct approach, even though it's tedious.Therefore, the work done is approximately 29,145.71 joules.But let me check if I can express this more precisely. Since all the terms were exact fractions, perhaps I can compute the integral exactly.Looking back:The integral of ( v(t)^3 ) is:-1828.5714285714286 + 6400 + 1920 + 800 - 4000 + 30,000 + 25,000But let's express each term as fractions:term1: -1828.5714285714286 = -1828 + 4/7 = -12800/7term2: 6400term3: 1920term4: 800term5: -4000term6: 30,000term7: 25,000So, total integral:-12800/7 + 6400 + 1920 + 800 - 4000 + 30,000 + 25,000Compute each term in fractions:Convert all to sevenths:-12800/7 + (6400 * 7)/7 + (1920 * 7)/7 + (800 * 7)/7 + (-4000 * 7)/7 + (30,000 * 7)/7 + (25,000 * 7)/7Compute each:-12800/7 + 44800/7 + 13440/7 + 5600/7 - 28000/7 + 210000/7 + 175000/7Now, sum all numerators:-12800 + 44800 + 13440 + 5600 - 28000 + 210000 + 175000 = ?Compute step by step:Start with -12800Add 44800: 44800 - 12800 = 32000Add 13440: 32000 + 13440 = 45440Add 5600: 45440 + 5600 = 51040Subtract 28000: 51040 - 28000 = 23040Add 210000: 23040 + 210000 = 233,040Add 175000: 233,040 + 175,000 = 408,040So, total numerator: 408,040Therefore, integral = 408,040 / 7 ≈ 58,291.42857142857Which matches our previous result.So, the exact value is 408,040 / 7, which is approximately 58,291.42857142857.Therefore, the work done is 0.5 * (408,040 / 7) = 204,020 / 7 ≈ 29,145.714285714285 joules.So, exactly, it's 204,020 / 7 J, which is approximately 29,145.71 J.Therefore, the work done against wind resistance is approximately 29,145.71 joules.But let me check if I can simplify 204,020 / 7:204,020 ÷ 7 = 29,145.714285...Yes, that's correct.So, summarizing:1. The total distance covered is approximately 1133.33 meters, which is less than 2000 meters. Therefore, the integral of v(t) from 0 to 200 does not equal 2000 meters.2. The work done against wind resistance is approximately 29,145.71 joules.But wait, the problem says to use integral calculus, so perhaps I should present the exact answers.For the first sub-problem, the exact distance is 1133 and 1/3 meters, because 1133.3333 is 1133 1/3.Similarly, for the work done, the exact value is 204,020 / 7 J, which is approximately 29,145.714 J.But let me compute 204,020 ÷ 7 exactly:7 * 29,145 = 204,015204,020 - 204,015 = 5So, 204,020 / 7 = 29,145 + 5/7 ≈ 29,145.7142857...So, the exact value is 29,145 and 5/7 joules.Therefore, the answers are:1. The total distance is 1133 1/3 meters, which is less than 2000 meters.2. The work done is 29,145 5/7 joules.But let me write them as exact fractions:1. Distance: 1133 1/3 m = 3400/3 mBecause 1133 * 3 = 3399, plus 1 is 3400, so 3400/3 m.2. Work: 204,020 / 7 JBut 204,020 ÷ 7 = 29,145.714285..., so as a fraction, it's 204,020/7 J.Alternatively, we can write it as 29,145 5/7 J.But perhaps the problem expects decimal answers rounded to a certain decimal place.Alternatively, since the problem didn't specify, I can present both exact and approximate answers.But in the context of the problem, since the velocity function is given with decimal coefficients, perhaps decimal answers are acceptable.So, final answers:1. Total distance: 1133.33 meters (which is 3400/3 m)2. Work done: 29,145.71 joules (which is 204,020/7 J)But let me check if I can simplify 204,020/7:204,020 ÷ 7 = 29,145.714285...Yes, that's correct.So, to summarize:1. The total distance covered is 3400/3 meters, which is approximately 1133.33 meters. This is less than 2000 meters, so the integral does not equal 2000 meters.2. The work done against wind resistance is 204,020/7 joules, approximately 29,145.71 joules.Therefore, the answers are:1. Distance: 3400/3 meters ≈ 1133.33 meters2. Work: 204,020/7 J ≈ 29,145.71 JBut let me write them in the boxed format as requested."},{"question":"Alex is a reserved bass player who loves to express his emotions through his music.

The entrepreneur wants to ensure that the fund grows over time while simultaneously supporting musicians. 1. The entrepreneur invests an initial amount of 500,000 into the Harmony Fund. The fund is structured such that it earns an annual interest rate of 5%, compounded continuously. Each year, exactly 10% of the fund's current balance is distributed as grants to musicians. Construct a differential equation that models the balance of the fund, ( B(t) ), at any time ( t ), where ( t ) is measured in years. Solve this differential equation to determine the balance of the fund after 10 years.2. In addition to the grants, the entrepreneur wants to allocate an annual sponsorship to a local music festival. The sponsorship amount each year is determined by a function ( S(t) = 10000e^{0.03t} ). Calculate the total amount of sponsorships given over the first 10 years. Also, determine the year when the annual sponsorship amount first exceeds 15,000.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about the Harmony Fund, and I need to model its balance over time and also calculate some sponsorships. Let me try to break it down step by step.First, part 1: The fund starts with 500,000. It earns 5% annual interest, compounded continuously. Each year, 10% of the current balance is given out as grants. I need to set up a differential equation for B(t), the balance at time t, and then solve it to find the balance after 10 years.Alright, so I know that continuous compounding interest can be modeled with a differential equation. The general form is dB/dt = rB, where r is the interest rate. But here, there's also a withdrawal each year. Since the grants are distributed each year, it's a continuous withdrawal as well? Or is it a discrete withdrawal?Wait, the problem says \\"exactly 10% of the fund's current balance is distributed as grants each year.\\" Hmm, so it's a yearly event, not continuous. But when setting up a differential equation, we often model continuous processes. So maybe I need to model the grants as a continuous withdrawal.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the grants as a continuous process for the sake of the differential equation. So, if 10% is taken out each year, that's equivalent to a continuous withdrawal rate. Let me think.If the grants are given out continuously, the rate at which money is leaving the fund would be 0.10 times the current balance. So, the differential equation would have two terms: the interest earned and the grants given out.So, the rate of change of the balance is the interest earned minus the grants given out. That is:dB/dt = rB - wBWhere r is the interest rate (5% or 0.05) and w is the withdrawal rate (10% or 0.10). So, substituting the values:dB/dt = 0.05B - 0.10B = -0.05BWait, that would mean dB/dt = -0.05B, which is a simple exponential decay. But that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me verify.Alternatively, maybe the grants are given out once a year, so it's a discrete withdrawal. In that case, the differential equation would only account for the continuous interest, and the grants would be subtracted at discrete points. But since we're asked to construct a differential equation, which is a continuous model, perhaps we need to model the grants as a continuous process.So, if 10% is taken out each year, the continuous withdrawal rate would be such that over a year, 10% is removed. So, if the withdrawal rate is w, then over one year, the amount withdrawn is wB(t) integrated over the year, which should equal 0.10B(t). So, integrating wB(t) from 0 to 1 equals 0.10B(t). Since B(t) is changing, but if we assume it's roughly constant over a year, then w * B(t) * 1 = 0.10B(t), so w = 0.10.Therefore, the differential equation is dB/dt = 0.05B - 0.10B = -0.05B.So, that's a linear differential equation. The solution would be B(t) = B0 * e^{-0.05t}, where B0 is the initial amount, 500,000.Wait, but if that's the case, the balance would be decreasing over time because the withdrawal rate is higher than the interest rate. That makes sense because 10% is being taken out each year, and only 5% is being earned. So, the fund is actually decreasing.But let me think again. If the grants are given out once a year, does that affect the differential equation? Because in reality, the balance is only reduced by 10% once a year, not continuously. So, modeling it as a continuous withdrawal might not be entirely accurate.Alternatively, perhaps the grants are distributed continuously, which would make the differential equation as I set up. But the problem says \\"each year, exactly 10% of the fund's current balance is distributed as grants.\\" So, it's a discrete event each year. Hmm, that complicates things because a differential equation is a continuous model.Wait, maybe I can still model it as a continuous process because the problem says \\"construct a differential equation that models the balance of the fund.\\" So, perhaps they expect us to model the grants as a continuous withdrawal, even though in reality it's discrete. So, proceeding with that, the differential equation is dB/dt = 0.05B - 0.10B = -0.05B.So, solving this, the general solution is B(t) = B0 * e^{-0.05t}. Plugging in B0 = 500,000, so B(t) = 500,000 * e^{-0.05t}.Then, the balance after 10 years would be B(10) = 500,000 * e^{-0.05*10} = 500,000 * e^{-0.5}.Calculating e^{-0.5} is approximately 0.6065. So, 500,000 * 0.6065 ≈ 303,250.Wait, but if the grants are given out once a year, the balance would decrease by 10% each year after the interest is added. So, maybe the model is different.Let me think again. If the fund earns 5% interest continuously, the balance at any time t is B(t) = 500,000 * e^{0.05t}. But then, each year, 10% is taken out. So, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation rather than a differential equation.Wait, but the problem specifically asks to construct a differential equation, so perhaps they expect the continuous model, even if it's an approximation.Alternatively, maybe the grants are being distributed continuously at a rate of 10% per year, so the differential equation is correct as dB/dt = 0.05B - 0.10B = -0.05B.So, I think I should proceed with that model.Therefore, the balance after 10 years is approximately 303,250.Wait, but let me check with the recurrence relation approach to see the difference.If we model it discretely: each year, the fund earns 5% interest, then 10% is taken out.So, starting with B0 = 500,000.After one year: B1 = B0 * e^{0.05} - 0.10 * B1.Wait, no, actually, the order matters. If the interest is earned continuously, then the balance at the end of the year is B0 * e^{0.05}, and then 10% is taken out, so B1 = B0 * e^{0.05} * (1 - 0.10) = B0 * e^{0.05} * 0.90.Similarly, each subsequent year, B_{n+1} = B_n * e^{0.05} * 0.90.So, after t years, B(t) = 500,000 * (e^{0.05} * 0.90)^t.Calculating that after 10 years: 500,000 * (e^{0.05} * 0.90)^10.e^{0.05} ≈ 1.05127, so 1.05127 * 0.90 ≈ 0.946143.Then, 0.946143^10 ≈ ?Calculating 0.946143^10:First, ln(0.946143) ≈ -0.0562.So, ln(result) = 10 * (-0.0562) = -0.562.Exponentiating: e^{-0.562} ≈ 0.569.So, 500,000 * 0.569 ≈ 284,500.Wait, so using the discrete model, the balance after 10 years is approximately 284,500, whereas the continuous model gave 303,250.So, which one is correct? The problem says to construct a differential equation, so I think they expect the continuous model, even though in reality it's a discrete withdrawal.Therefore, I think the answer is approximately 303,250.But let me see if I can reconcile this. If the grants are given out continuously, the differential equation is dB/dt = 0.05B - 0.10B = -0.05B, which gives B(t) = 500,000 e^{-0.05t}.After 10 years, that's 500,000 e^{-0.5} ≈ 500,000 * 0.6065 ≈ 303,250.Alternatively, if it's a discrete withdrawal each year, the balance decreases more, as we saw.But since the problem asks for a differential equation, I think the continuous model is what's expected.So, moving on to part 2: The entrepreneur also allocates an annual sponsorship to a local music festival, given by S(t) = 10,000 e^{0.03t}. We need to calculate the total sponsorships over the first 10 years and determine the year when the annual sponsorship first exceeds 15,000.First, the total sponsorships over 10 years. Since S(t) is given as a function of t, and t is in years, but the sponsorship is annual. Wait, does S(t) represent the sponsorship amount in year t, or is it a continuous function?The problem says \\"the sponsorship amount each year is determined by a function S(t) = 10000e^{0.03t}.\\" So, S(t) is the sponsorship in year t.Therefore, to find the total sponsorships over the first 10 years, we need to sum S(t) from t=0 to t=9, or t=1 to t=10? Wait, the wording is \\"over the first 10 years,\\" so probably t=0 to t=9, but sometimes people count t=1 to t=10 as the first 10 years.Wait, let me check: If t=0 is the initial year, then t=0 to t=9 is 10 years. Alternatively, t=1 to t=10 is also 10 years. But since the function is S(t) = 10000e^{0.03t}, and t is measured in years, starting from t=0.So, the total sponsorship over the first 10 years would be the sum from t=0 to t=9 of S(t), or the integral from t=0 to t=10 of S(t) dt? Wait, no, because S(t) is given as an annual amount, so it's a discrete sum, not an integral.Therefore, the total sponsorships would be the sum from t=0 to t=9 of 10000 e^{0.03t}.Alternatively, if t is measured in years, and the sponsorship is given each year, then the total over 10 years is the sum from t=1 to t=10 of 10000 e^{0.03(t-1)}.Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me clarify.If t=0 is the starting point, then in year 1 (t=1), the sponsorship is S(1) = 10000 e^{0.03*1}. Similarly, in year 2, S(2) = 10000 e^{0.06}, etc., up to year 10, S(10) = 10000 e^{0.30}.Therefore, the total sponsorships over the first 10 years would be the sum from t=1 to t=10 of 10000 e^{0.03t}.Alternatively, if we consider t=0 as the first year, then the total is from t=0 to t=9.But the problem says \\"over the first 10 years,\\" so probably t=0 to t=9, which is 10 terms.But let's proceed with t=0 to t=9.So, the total T = sum_{t=0}^{9} 10000 e^{0.03t}.This is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by e^{0.03} each year.The sum of a geometric series is S = a1 * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.Here, a1 = 10000 e^{0} = 10000.r = e^{0.03} ≈ 1.03045.n = 10.So, T = 10000 * ( (1.03045)^10 - 1 ) / (1.03045 - 1 )First, calculate (1.03045)^10.Using a calculator, 1.03045^10 ≈ e^{0.03*10} = e^{0.3} ≈ 1.349858.Wait, but 1.03045^10 is approximately equal to e^{0.03*10} because ln(1.03045) ≈ 0.03, so (1.03045)^10 ≈ e^{0.3} ≈ 1.349858.So, T ≈ 10000 * (1.349858 - 1) / (0.03045) ≈ 10000 * (0.349858 / 0.03045) ≈ 10000 * 11.49 ≈ 114,900.Alternatively, more accurately, let's compute 1.03045^10.Using a calculator:1.03045^1 = 1.030451.03045^2 ≈ 1.03045 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.061831.03045^3 ≈ 1.06183 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.094281.03045^4 ≈ 1.09428 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.127831.03045^5 ≈ 1.12783 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.162571.03045^6 ≈ 1.16257 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.198561.03045^7 ≈ 1.19856 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.235831.03045^8 ≈ 1.23583 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.274471.03045^9 ≈ 1.27447 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.314561.03045^10 ≈ 1.31456 * 1.03045 ≈ 1.3555So, more accurately, (1.03045)^10 ≈ 1.3555.Therefore, T = 10000 * (1.3555 - 1) / (0.03045) ≈ 10000 * (0.3555 / 0.03045) ≈ 10000 * 11.67 ≈ 116,700.Wait, that's a bit more precise. So, approximately 116,700.Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:Sum = a1 * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1) = 10000 * ( (1.03045)^10 - 1 ) / (0.03045 )We can calculate this more accurately.First, compute (1.03045)^10:Using a calculator, 1.03045^10 ≈ 1.3555.So, 1.3555 - 1 = 0.3555.Divide by 0.03045: 0.3555 / 0.03045 ≈ 11.67.Multiply by 10000: 116,700.So, the total sponsorships over the first 10 years are approximately 116,700.Alternatively, if we model it as a continuous function, the total would be the integral from t=0 to t=10 of 10000 e^{0.03t} dt.But since the problem says \\"the sponsorship amount each year is determined by a function S(t) = 10000e^{0.03t}\\", it's likely a discrete sum, not an integral. So, I think the sum approach is correct.Now, the second part: determine the year when the annual sponsorship amount first exceeds 15,000.So, we need to find the smallest integer t such that S(t) = 10000 e^{0.03t} > 15000.Solving for t:10000 e^{0.03t} > 15000Divide both sides by 10000:e^{0.03t} > 1.5Take natural log of both sides:0.03t > ln(1.5)Compute ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055So, t > 0.4055 / 0.03 ≈ 13.5167Since t must be an integer (year), the smallest integer greater than 13.5167 is 14.Therefore, in year 14, the sponsorship amount first exceeds 15,000.Wait, but let me check:At t=13: S(13) = 10000 e^{0.03*13} = 10000 e^{0.39} ≈ 10000 * 1.477 ≈ 14,770, which is less than 15,000.At t=14: S(14) = 10000 e^{0.03*14} = 10000 e^{0.42} ≈ 10000 * 1.5219 ≈ 15,219, which is more than 15,000.So, the first year when the sponsorship exceeds 15,000 is year 14.But wait, in the problem, part 2 is about the first 10 years, so the sponsorship amount in year 10 is S(10) = 10000 e^{0.3} ≈ 10000 * 1.349858 ≈ 13,498.58, which is less than 15,000. So, within the first 10 years, it doesn't exceed 15,000. The first time it exceeds is in year 14.So, summarizing:1. The differential equation is dB/dt = -0.05B, with solution B(t) = 500,000 e^{-0.05t}. After 10 years, B(10) ≈ 500,000 * e^{-0.5} ≈ 303,250.2. The total sponsorships over the first 10 years are approximately 116,700, and the sponsorship first exceeds 15,000 in year 14.Wait, but let me double-check the differential equation part because earlier I considered two models: continuous withdrawal and discrete withdrawal.If the grants are given out once a year, the balance equation would be different. Let me try to model it correctly.The fund earns 5% interest continuously, so the balance at time t is B(t) = 500,000 e^{0.05t}. Then, each year, 10% is taken out. So, after the first year, the balance is B(1) = 500,000 e^{0.05} * (1 - 0.10) = 500,000 * e^{0.05} * 0.90.Similarly, after the second year, B(2) = B(1) * e^{0.05} * 0.90 = 500,000 * (e^{0.05} * 0.90)^2.So, in general, B(n) = 500,000 * (e^{0.05} * 0.90)^n for integer n.Therefore, after 10 years, B(10) = 500,000 * (e^{0.05} * 0.90)^10.Calculating e^{0.05} ≈ 1.05127, so 1.05127 * 0.90 ≈ 0.946143.Then, 0.946143^10 ≈ ?Using logarithms: ln(0.946143) ≈ -0.0562.So, ln(result) = 10 * (-0.0562) = -0.562.Exponentiating: e^{-0.562} ≈ 0.569.Therefore, B(10) ≈ 500,000 * 0.569 ≈ 284,500.But this contradicts the continuous model which gave 303,250.So, which one is correct?The problem says \\"construct a differential equation that models the balance of the fund.\\" So, if we model the grants as a continuous withdrawal, the differential equation is dB/dt = 0.05B - 0.10B = -0.05B, leading to B(t) = 500,000 e^{-0.05t}.But if the grants are given out discretely each year, the balance decreases more, as shown in the discrete model.However, the problem specifically asks for a differential equation, which implies a continuous model. Therefore, despite the grants being given out discretely, we model them as a continuous process for the sake of the differential equation.Therefore, the answer is approximately 303,250 after 10 years.But to be thorough, let me see if there's a way to model the discrete grants within a differential equation.Alternatively, perhaps the grants are given out continuously at a rate of 10% per year, which would mean the differential equation is correct as dB/dt = 0.05B - 0.10B = -0.05B.Yes, that makes sense. So, the continuous withdrawal rate is 10% per year, so the differential equation is as above.Therefore, I think the answer is 303,250.Now, for part 2, the total sponsorships over the first 10 years is approximately 116,700, and the sponsorship first exceeds 15,000 in year 14.So, to summarize:1. Differential equation: dB/dt = -0.05B, solution B(t) = 500,000 e^{-0.05t}. After 10 years, B(10) ≈ 303,250.2. Total sponsorships: ≈ 116,700 over 10 years. First exceeds 15,000 in year 14.I think that's it."},{"question":"A film producer is collaborating on a project to highlight the impact of Nollywood on global cinema.

Since he has a total of 18 Petri dishes and wants to distribute them equally, I'll divide 18 by 3.18 divided by 3 equals 6. So, Alex will use 6 Petri dishes for each staining technique.Next, Alex finds 5 additional empty Petri dishes. To distribute these evenly across the three techniques, I'll divide 5 by 3. This gives approximately 1.666, which isn't a whole number. Since Alex can't use a fraction of a Petri dish, he'll need to distribute them as evenly as possible. This means adding 2 dishes to two of the techniques and 1 dish to the third.After adding the extra dishes, the distribution will be as follows:- Two techniques will have 7 Petri dishes each (6 + 1).- One technique will have 8 Petri dishes (6 + 2).This ensures that the additional dishes are distributed as evenly as possible across the three staining techniques."},{"question":"Dr. Jane is an epidemiologist studying a disease outbreak. She collected 150 viral genome sequences from patients in the first week of the outbreak. In the second week, she collected 30% more sequences than she did in the first week.

She notices that each machine in the line can produce 15 widgets per hour. There are currently 8 machines operating simultaneously. However, she plans to increase the production efficiency by 20% by upgrading the machines next month. Additionally, she realizes that for every 100 widgets produced, 5 are faulty and need to be discarded. If the factory operates 10 hours a day, how many non-faulty widgets will the factory produce in a day after the machines are upgraded?","answer":"First, I need to determine the current production capacity of the factory. There are 8 machines, each producing 15 widgets per hour. So, the total production per hour is 8 multiplied by 15, which equals 120 widgets per hour.Next, the factory operates for 10 hours each day. Therefore, the total production in a day before any upgrades is 120 widgets per hour multiplied by 10 hours, resulting in 1,200 widgets per day.The engineer plans to increase production efficiency by 20%. To find the new production rate, I'll calculate 20% of the current production and add it to the original amount. 20% of 1,200 widgets is 240 widgets. Adding this to the original production gives a total of 1,440 widgets per day after the upgrade.However, not all produced widgets are non-faulty. For every 100 widgets produced, 5 are faulty. This means that 95 out of every 100 widgets are good. To find the number of non-faulty widgets, I'll calculate 95% of the total production after the upgrade. 95% of 1,440 widgets is 1,368 widgets.Therefore, after upgrading the machines, the factory will produce 1,368 non-faulty widgets in a day."},{"question":"Alex, a technology journalist and futurist, is writing an anthology that includes 5 stories.

The enemy deals 25 damage per minute, so over 3 minutes, that's 25 * 3 = 75 damage. Meanwhile, the strategy adds 40 health points every 3 minutes. Therefore, the net change in health every 3 minutes is 40 - 75 = -35 points.This means that every 3 minutes, the team's health decreases by 35 points.Next, I'll determine how many such 3-minute intervals are needed to reduce the health from 150 to 100 points. The total decrease needed is 150 - 100 = 50 points. Since each interval results in a decrease of 35 points, I'll divide 50 by 35 to find the number of intervals: 50 / 35 ≈ 1.4286 intervals.Since each interval is 3 minutes, the total time required is 1.4286 * 3 ≈ 4.2857 minutes.Rounding to two decimal places, it will take approximately 4.29 minutes for the team's health to be reduced to exactly 100 points."},{"question":"Alex is a software tester who works on traffic management systems, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently. One day, Alex is testing a new traffic light control system. The system is supposed to manage the traffic flow by changing lights at three intersections. Each intersection has a traffic light that changes every 2 minutes. Alex notices that the first intersection's light changes at 1 minute after the hour, the second at 3 minutes after the hour, and the third at 5 minutes after the hour. If Alex starts observing the system at exactly 12:00 PM, how many times will the traffic lights at all three intersections change by 12:30 PM?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total observation period, which is from 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, totaling 30 minutes.Each traffic light changes every 2 minutes. Therefore, the number of changes for each light within 30 minutes can be calculated by dividing the total minutes by the interval between changes.For the first intersection, which changes at 1 minute after the hour, the number of changes is 30 divided by 2, which equals 15 changes.Similarly, the second intersection, changing at 3 minutes after the hour, will also have 15 changes.The third intersection, changing at 5 minutes after the hour, will also have 15 changes.Adding up the changes from all three intersections, the total number of traffic light changes observed by Alex is 15 + 15 + 15, which equals 45 changes."},{"question":"Alex, an avid fan of 3x3 basketball from England, loves to watch and create Wiki pages about his favorite sport.

He meticulously calculates the optimal viewing strategy to maximize his experience, combining his love for sports with his passion for mathematics. The Tour de France has 21 stages, and Jean-Luc wants to attend certain stages in person while watching others on television.1. Jean-Luc decides to attend a subset of stages in person based on the following criteria:   - He will attend exactly ( k ) stages in person, where ( k ) is a positive integer.   - The stages he attends must form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference ( d ), where ( d ) is also a positive integer.     Determine the number of possible values of ( k ) such that Jean-Luc can attend the stages in person, given that ( d ) can take any positive integer value and the arithmetic sequence starts at stage 1.2. If Jean-Luc decides to adjust his plan to maximize his viewing experience, he incorporates the French national holidays into his schedule. Suppose that there are ( m ) national holidays during the period of the Tour de France, and Jean-Luc wants to ensure that he attends at least one of the stages coinciding with a national holiday. Assuming the holidays fall on stages randomly, calculate the probability that a randomly chosen arithmetic sequence of stages (with parameters ( k ) and ( d ) from problem 1) includes at least one national holiday. Assume ( m ) is given and the holidays are independently and uniformly distributed among the 21 stages.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about Jean-Luc planning to watch the Tour de France. There are two parts, and I need to figure out both. Let me start with the first one.**Problem 1:**Jean-Luc wants to attend exactly ( k ) stages in person, forming an arithmetic sequence starting at stage 1 with a common difference ( d ). I need to find the number of possible values of ( k ) such that this is possible, given that ( d ) can be any positive integer.Hmm, okay. So an arithmetic sequence starting at 1 with difference ( d ) would look like: 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, ..., 1 + (k-1)d. Since there are 21 stages, the last term of this sequence must be less than or equal to 21.So, the condition is:[ 1 + (k - 1)d leq 21 ]Which simplifies to:[ (k - 1)d leq 20 ]Since ( d ) is a positive integer, for each ( k ), we need to check if there exists a ( d ) such that this inequality holds.But actually, since ( d ) can be any positive integer, for a given ( k ), as long as ( k - 1 ) is less than or equal to 20, we can choose ( d = 1 ). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because ( d ) can vary, but for each ( k ), we need that there exists some ( d ) such that ( (k - 1)d leq 20 ).But actually, since ( d ) can be 1, which is the smallest possible, then for any ( k ) where ( k - 1 leq 20 ), which is ( k leq 21 ), but ( k ) must be at least 1. But since ( k ) is a positive integer, and the maximum number of stages is 21, the maximum ( k ) can be is 21, but in that case, ( d ) would have to be 0, which is not allowed because ( d ) must be positive. So actually, the maximum ( k ) is 21, but with ( d = 1 ), that would require ( (21 - 1)d = 20d leq 20 ), so ( d leq 1 ). So ( d = 1 ) is the only possibility for ( k = 21 ).Wait, but ( k ) can be from 1 to 21, but for each ( k ), we need to see if there exists a ( d ) such that ( (k - 1)d leq 20 ). Since ( d ) is a positive integer, for each ( k ), as long as ( k - 1 leq 20 ), which is always true because ( k leq 21 ), so ( k - 1 leq 20 ). Therefore, for each ( k ) from 1 to 21, there exists a ( d ) (specifically, ( d = 1 )) that satisfies the condition.Wait, but that can't be right because if ( k = 21 ), then ( (21 - 1)d = 20d leq 20 ) implies ( d leq 1 ), so ( d = 1 ). So the sequence would be 1, 2, 3, ..., 21, which is valid.Similarly, for ( k = 2 ), ( d ) can be any integer such that ( (2 - 1)d leq 20 ), so ( d leq 20 ). So ( d ) can be 1 to 20.But wait, the question is asking for the number of possible values of ( k ). So regardless of ( d ), as long as for each ( k ), there exists some ( d ), which is true for all ( k ) from 1 to 21. But wait, when ( k = 1 ), the sequence is just stage 1, which is valid. So does that mean all ( k ) from 1 to 21 are possible?But wait, let me think again. For ( k = 21 ), the sequence is 1, 2, ..., 21, which is valid. For ( k = 20 ), we need ( (20 - 1)d leq 20 ), so ( 19d leq 20 ). Therefore, ( d ) can be 1, since 19*1=19 ≤20, but ( d=2 ) would be 38>20, which is invalid. So ( d=1 ) is the only possibility for ( k=20 ). Similarly, for ( k=19 ), ( 18d leq 20 ), so ( d ) can be 1, since 18*1=18 ≤20, and ( d=2 ) would be 36>20. So ( d=1 ) is the only possibility.Wait, but for smaller ( k ), like ( k=2 ), ( d ) can be up to 20, so there are multiple possible ( d ). But the question is not about how many sequences, but how many possible ( k ). So regardless of how many ( d ) are possible for each ( k ), as long as at least one ( d ) exists, ( k ) is possible.Therefore, since for each ( k ) from 1 to 21, there exists at least one ( d ) (specifically, ( d=1 )), the number of possible ( k ) is 21.Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check for ( k=21 ). The sequence would be 1, 2, 3, ..., 21, which is valid with ( d=1 ). For ( k=20 ), the sequence is 1, 2, ..., 20, but wait, that would require ( d=1 ), but the last term is 1 + (20-1)*1 = 20, which is within 21. So that's valid. Similarly, for ( k=19 ), the last term is 1 + 18*1=19, which is within 21. So yes, all ( k ) from 1 to 21 are possible.But wait, the problem says \\"exactly ( k ) stages\\", so ( k ) can't be more than 21, obviously. So the number of possible ( k ) is 21.Wait, but let me think again. If ( k=1 ), it's just stage 1, which is valid. If ( k=2 ), stages 1 and 1+d, where d can be 1 to 20, so yes, valid. Similarly, up to ( k=21 ). So yes, all ( k ) from 1 to 21 are possible. Therefore, the number of possible values of ( k ) is 21.But wait, the problem says \\"exactly ( k ) stages\\", so ( k ) must be at least 1 and at most 21. Therefore, the number of possible ( k ) is 21.Wait, but let me think again. For ( k=21 ), the sequence is 1, 2, 3, ..., 21, which is valid. For ( k=20 ), the sequence is 1, 2, ..., 20, which is valid. Similarly, for ( k=19 ), 1, 2, ..., 19, and so on. So yes, all ( k ) from 1 to 21 are possible.Therefore, the answer to problem 1 is 21.**Problem 2:**Jean-Luc now wants to ensure that his chosen arithmetic sequence includes at least one national holiday. There are ( m ) holidays randomly distributed among the 21 stages. I need to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen arithmetic sequence (with parameters ( k ) and ( d ) from problem 1) includes at least one holiday.Wait, but in problem 1, we determined that ( k ) can be any from 1 to 21, but for each ( k ), there are multiple possible ( d ). So when the problem says \\"a randomly chosen arithmetic sequence\\", I think it means choosing uniformly at random among all possible arithmetic sequences that start at 1 with positive integer ( d ) and have exactly ( k ) stages, where ( k ) is from 1 to 21.But wait, actually, in problem 1, the number of possible ( k ) is 21, but for each ( k ), the number of possible ( d ) varies. So the total number of possible arithmetic sequences is the sum over ( k=1 ) to 21 of the number of possible ( d ) for each ( k ).Wait, but the problem says \\"a randomly chosen arithmetic sequence of stages (with parameters ( k ) and ( d ) from problem 1)\\". So I think it's considering all possible arithmetic sequences starting at 1 with any ( k ) and ( d ), where ( k ) is from 1 to 21, and for each ( k ), ( d ) is such that the sequence is within 21 stages.So to compute the probability, I need to find the number of such sequences that include at least one holiday, divided by the total number of such sequences.But given that the holidays are randomly distributed, the probability that a given sequence includes at least one holiday is equal to 1 minus the probability that none of the stages in the sequence are holidays.So, let me denote:- Total number of stages: 21- Number of holidays: ( m )- A sequence has ( k ) stages, so the number of ways to choose a sequence is dependent on ( k ) and ( d ).But wait, actually, the probability is over all possible sequences, each equally likely, and each sequence has a certain probability of containing at least one holiday.But the holidays are fixed, but in the problem, it's stated that the holidays are independently and uniformly distributed among the 21 stages. Wait, actually, the problem says \\"the holidays fall on stages randomly\\", so I think it's that each holiday is assigned to a stage uniformly at random, independently.But actually, the problem says \\"the holidays are independently and uniformly distributed among the 21 stages.\\" So each holiday is assigned to a stage uniformly at random, independently. So the probability that a particular stage is a holiday is ( frac{m}{21} ), but actually, since each holiday is assigned independently, the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(1 - frac{1}{21}right)^m ), but that's not exactly correct because the holidays are assigned without replacement, right?Wait, no, the problem says \\"the holidays fall on stages randomly\\", and \\"independently and uniformly distributed\\". So I think it's that each holiday is assigned to a stage uniformly at random, independently. So it's possible for multiple holidays to fall on the same stage, but since there are ( m ) holidays, each assigned to a stage uniformly at random, the probability that a particular stage is a holiday is ( 1 - left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ), because the probability that a particular stage is not chosen in any of the ( m ) assignments is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ), so the probability that it is chosen at least once is ( 1 - left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ).But actually, wait, no. If the holidays are assigned independently, then the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ), so the probability that it is a holiday is ( 1 - left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ). But actually, if the holidays are assigned without replacement, meaning each holiday is on a distinct stage, then the probability is different. But the problem says \\"independently and uniformly distributed\\", so I think it's with replacement, meaning multiple holidays can be on the same stage.But actually, in reality, national holidays are distinct days, so I think it's more accurate to model them as being assigned without replacement. So the number of ways to choose ( m ) distinct stages out of 21, each equally likely.Therefore, the probability that a particular stage is a holiday is ( frac{m}{21} ), because each stage has an equal chance of being selected.Wait, but if the holidays are assigned without replacement, then the probability that a particular stage is a holiday is ( frac{m}{21} ), since there are ( m ) holidays out of 21 stages.But in the problem, it's stated that the holidays are \\"independently and uniformly distributed\\", which suggests that each holiday is assigned independently, meaning that the same stage can have multiple holidays, but that seems a bit odd. So perhaps it's better to model it as choosing ( m ) distinct stages uniformly at random.In that case, the probability that a particular stage is a holiday is ( frac{m}{21} ), and the probability that it's not a holiday is ( 1 - frac{m}{21} ).But the problem is about the probability that a randomly chosen arithmetic sequence includes at least one holiday. So for a given sequence, the probability that none of its stages are holidays is ( left(1 - frac{m}{21}right)^k ), assuming independence, but actually, if the holidays are assigned without replacement, the events are not independent.Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me clarify.If the ( m ) holidays are assigned to the 21 stages without replacement, meaning each holiday is on a distinct stage, then the probability that a particular stage is a holiday is ( frac{m}{21} ). The probability that a particular sequence of ( k ) stages contains at least one holiday is equal to 1 minus the probability that none of the ( k ) stages are holidays.The number of ways to choose ( m ) stages without replacement is ( binom{21}{m} ). The number of ways to choose ( m ) stages such that none are in the sequence is ( binom{21 - k}{m} ), provided that ( 21 - k geq m ). Otherwise, it's zero.Therefore, the probability that none of the ( k ) stages are holidays is ( frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ), provided that ( 21 - k geq m ). If ( 21 - k < m ), then it's impossible to have all holidays outside the sequence, so the probability is 0.Therefore, the probability that the sequence includes at least one holiday is:[ 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ] if ( 21 - k geq m ), else 1.But wait, in the problem, the sequence is chosen first, and then the holidays are assigned. Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says \\"the holidays fall on stages randomly\\", and Jean-Luc is choosing the sequence. So I think the sequence is chosen uniformly at random from all possible arithmetic sequences starting at 1, and then the holidays are assigned randomly. So the probability is over both the choice of the sequence and the assignment of holidays.Wait, no, the problem says \\"the probability that a randomly chosen arithmetic sequence... includes at least one national holiday\\". So the sequence is chosen uniformly at random, and the holidays are assigned uniformly at random, independently.Therefore, the probability is the expectation over all possible sequences and all possible holiday assignments.But perhaps it's easier to compute it as follows:For a given sequence, the probability that it includes at least one holiday is ( 1 - left(frac{21 - m}{21}right)^k ), if the holidays are assigned with replacement. But if they are assigned without replacement, it's ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ).But the problem says \\"the holidays are independently and uniformly distributed among the 21 stages\\". The word \\"independently\\" suggests that each holiday is assigned independently, meaning with replacement, so the same stage can have multiple holidays. But in reality, national holidays are distinct days, so it's more likely without replacement.But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we have to assume that each holiday is assigned independently, meaning with replacement, so the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ), so the probability that all ( k ) stages in the sequence are not holidays is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{m cdot k} ). Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, if each holiday is assigned independently, then for each holiday, the probability that it is not on a particular stage is ( frac{20}{21} ). So the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ). Therefore, the probability that all ( k ) stages in the sequence are not holidays is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{m cdot k} ). Wait, no, that's not correct either.Wait, no, the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ), because each holiday has a ( frac{20}{21} ) chance of not being on that stage, and there are ( m ) holidays. So the probability that none of the ( k ) stages are holidays is the product over each stage in the sequence of the probability that it's not a holiday. But since the holidays are assigned independently, the events are independent.Wait, no, actually, if the holidays are assigned independently, then the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ), as each holiday has a ( frac{20}{21} ) chance of not being on that stage. Therefore, the probability that all ( k ) stages in the sequence are not holidays is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{m cdot k} ). Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, no, the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ), because each of the ( m ) holidays has a ( frac{20}{21} ) chance of not being on that stage. Therefore, the probability that all ( k ) stages in the sequence are not holidays is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{m cdot k} ). But that seems too small.Wait, actually, no. The probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ). Therefore, the probability that all ( k ) stages are not holidays is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{m cdot k} ). But that's only if the stages are independent, which they are not, because the holidays are assigned independently.Wait, no, actually, the probability that none of the ( k ) stages are holidays is the product of the probabilities that each stage is not a holiday, which is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ) for each stage, but since the stages are distinct, the events are independent. Therefore, the probability that all ( k ) stages are not holidays is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{m cdot k} ).But that seems incorrect because if ( k = 21 ), then the probability that none are holidays is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{21m} ), which is extremely small, but in reality, if all stages are in the sequence, then the probability that none are holidays is zero, because all stages are included, so if there are ( m ) holidays, they must be in the sequence. So this suggests that the model is incorrect.Therefore, perhaps the correct model is that the holidays are assigned without replacement, meaning that each holiday is on a distinct stage. Therefore, the probability that a particular stage is a holiday is ( frac{m}{21} ), and the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( 1 - frac{m}{21} ).In that case, the probability that none of the ( k ) stages in the sequence are holidays is ( frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ), as I thought earlier.Therefore, the probability that the sequence includes at least one holiday is:[ 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ]But this is only valid if ( 21 - k geq m ). If ( 21 - k < m ), then it's impossible to have all holidays outside the sequence, so the probability is 1.But wait, in the problem, the sequence is chosen first, and then the holidays are assigned. So the probability is over all possible sequences and all possible holiday assignments.But actually, the problem says \\"the probability that a randomly chosen arithmetic sequence... includes at least one national holiday\\". So the sequence is chosen uniformly at random, and the holidays are assigned uniformly at random, independently.Therefore, the overall probability is the expectation over all sequences of the probability that the sequence includes at least one holiday.But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to compute it as follows:The total number of possible sequences is the sum over ( k=1 ) to 21 of the number of possible ( d ) for each ( k ). Let me denote this total as ( N ).For each sequence, the probability that it includes at least one holiday is ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ) if ( 21 - k geq m ), else 1.Therefore, the overall probability is the average of ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ) over all possible sequences.But this seems complicated because the number of sequences varies with ( k ). Alternatively, perhaps we can compute it as:The probability that a randomly chosen sequence includes at least one holiday is equal to the expected value of the indicator variable that the sequence includes at least one holiday. This can be written as:[ frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} sum_{d=1}^{d_k} left(1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}}right)}{N} ]Where ( d_k ) is the maximum ( d ) for each ( k ), and ( N ) is the total number of sequences.But this seems too involved. Maybe there's a smarter way.Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the probability that none of the sequences include any holidays, and then subtract that from 1.Wait, no, that's not straightforward.Wait, another approach: For each stage, the probability that it is not a holiday is ( 1 - frac{m}{21} ) if the holidays are assigned without replacement. Then, the probability that a particular sequence of ( k ) stages does not include any holidays is ( left(1 - frac{m}{21}right)^k ). But this is only if the stages are independent, which they are not, because the holidays are assigned without replacement.Wait, no, if the holidays are assigned without replacement, the probability that a particular sequence of ( k ) stages contains no holidays is ( frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ).Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen sequence includes at least one holiday is:[ 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ]But this is for a fixed ( k ). However, in our case, the sequence is chosen uniformly at random from all possible arithmetic sequences starting at 1, which have varying ( k ).Therefore, the overall probability is the average of ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ) over all possible sequences, weighted by the number of sequences for each ( k ).But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, we can compute the expected number of holidays in a randomly chosen sequence, and then use that to find the probability that at least one holiday is present.Wait, but the expected number of holidays in a sequence is ( k cdot frac{m}{21} ), assuming uniform distribution. But that doesn't directly give the probability that at least one holiday is present.Alternatively, perhaps we can use linearity of expectation. The probability that a particular holiday is in the sequence is ( frac{k}{21} ), since each holiday is equally likely to be on any stage. Therefore, the expected number of holidays in the sequence is ( m cdot frac{k}{21} ). But again, this doesn't directly give the probability of at least one holiday.Wait, but if we consider the probability that a particular holiday is not in the sequence, it's ( 1 - frac{k}{21} ). Therefore, the probability that none of the ( m ) holidays are in the sequence is ( left(1 - frac{k}{21}right)^m ), assuming independence, which is not exactly correct because the holidays are assigned without replacement.Wait, no, if the holidays are assigned without replacement, the probability that none are in the sequence is ( frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ).Therefore, the probability that at least one holiday is in the sequence is ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ).But since the sequence is chosen uniformly at random, we need to average this probability over all possible sequences.Wait, but each sequence has a different ( k ), so the probability depends on ( k ). Therefore, the overall probability is:[ frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k left(1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}}right)}{N} ]Where ( N_k ) is the number of sequences with ( k ) stages, and ( N = sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k ).But this requires knowing ( N_k ) for each ( k ), which is the number of possible ( d ) for each ( k ).From problem 1, for each ( k ), ( d ) must satisfy ( (k - 1)d leq 20 ). Therefore, ( d leq frac{20}{k - 1} ). Since ( d ) is a positive integer, the number of possible ( d ) is ( leftlfloor frac{20}{k - 1} rightrfloor ).Wait, let's compute ( N_k ) for each ( k ):For ( k = 1 ): ( d ) can be any positive integer, but since ( k=1 ), the sequence is just stage 1, so ( d ) is irrelevant. So ( N_1 = 1 ).For ( k = 2 ): ( (2 - 1)d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 20 ). So ( N_2 = 20 ).For ( k = 3 ): ( 2d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 10 ). So ( N_3 = 10 ).For ( k = 4 ): ( 3d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 6 ) (since 3*6=18 ≤20, 3*7=21>20). So ( N_4 = 6 ).For ( k = 5 ): ( 4d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 5 ). So ( N_5 = 5 ).For ( k = 6 ): ( 5d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 4 ). So ( N_6 = 4 ).For ( k = 7 ): ( 6d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 3 ) (since 6*3=18 ≤20, 6*4=24>20). So ( N_7 = 3 ).For ( k = 8 ): ( 7d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 2 ) (since 7*2=14 ≤20, 7*3=21>20). So ( N_8 = 2 ).For ( k = 9 ): ( 8d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 2 ) (since 8*2=16 ≤20, 8*3=24>20). So ( N_9 = 2 ).Wait, no, 8*2=16 ≤20, 8*3=24>20, so ( d=1,2 ). So ( N_9 = 2 ).For ( k = 10 ): ( 9d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 2 ) (since 9*2=18 ≤20, 9*3=27>20). So ( N_{10} = 2 ).For ( k = 11 ): ( 10d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 2 ) (since 10*2=20 ≤20, 10*3=30>20). So ( N_{11} = 2 ).For ( k = 12 ): ( 11d leq 20 ) => ( d leq 1 ) (since 11*1=11 ≤20, 11*2=22>20). So ( N_{12} = 1 ).Similarly, for ( k = 13 ) to ( k = 21 ): ( (k - 1)d leq 20 ). For ( k=13 ), ( 12d leq 20 ) => ( d=1 ). Similarly, for ( k=14 ), ( 13d leq 20 ) => ( d=1 ). And so on up to ( k=21 ), where ( 20d leq 20 ) => ( d=1 ).So let's list all ( N_k ):- ( k=1 ): 1- ( k=2 ): 20- ( k=3 ): 10- ( k=4 ): 6- ( k=5 ): 5- ( k=6 ): 4- ( k=7 ): 3- ( k=8 ): 2- ( k=9 ): 2- ( k=10 ): 2- ( k=11 ): 2- ( k=12 ): 1- ( k=13 ): 1- ( k=14 ): 1- ( k=15 ): 1- ( k=16 ): 1- ( k=17 ): 1- ( k=18 ): 1- ( k=19 ): 1- ( k=20 ): 1- ( k=21 ): 1Now, let's compute ( N ), the total number of sequences:( N = 1 + 20 + 10 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 )Let me add them up step by step:Start with 1 (k=1).Add 20: total 21.Add 10: total 31.Add 6: total 37.Add 5: total 42.Add 4: total 46.Add 3: total 49.Add 2: total 51.Add 2: total 53.Add 2: total 55.Add 2: total 57.Add 1: total 58.Add 1: total 59.Add 1: total 60.Add 1: total 61.Add 1: total 62.Add 1: total 63.Add 1: total 64.Add 1: total 65.Add 1: total 66.Wait, let me recount:1 (k=1)+20=21+10=31+6=37+5=42+4=46+3=49+2=51+2=53+2=55+2=57+1=58+1=59+1=60+1=61+1=62+1=63+1=64+1=65+1=66Wait, that's 21 terms, but I think I missed some. Wait, from k=1 to k=21, that's 21 terms. Let me recount:1 (k=1)+20=21 (k=2)+10=31 (k=3)+6=37 (k=4)+5=42 (k=5)+4=46 (k=6)+3=49 (k=7)+2=51 (k=8)+2=53 (k=9)+2=55 (k=10)+2=57 (k=11)+1=58 (k=12)+1=59 (k=13)+1=60 (k=14)+1=61 (k=15)+1=62 (k=16)+1=63 (k=17)+1=64 (k=18)+1=65 (k=19)+1=66 (k=20)+1=67 (k=21)Wait, so total N=67.Wait, that seems correct. Let me check:From k=1:1k=2:20 (total 21)k=3:10 (31)k=4:6 (37)k=5:5 (42)k=6:4 (46)k=7:3 (49)k=8:2 (51)k=9:2 (53)k=10:2 (55)k=11:2 (57)k=12:1 (58)k=13:1 (59)k=14:1 (60)k=15:1 (61)k=16:1 (62)k=17:1 (63)k=18:1 (64)k=19:1 (65)k=20:1 (66)k=21:1 (67)Yes, total N=67.Now, for each ( k ), the number of sequences is ( N_k ), and for each sequence with ( k ) stages, the probability that it includes at least one holiday is ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ) if ( 21 - k geq m ), else 1.Therefore, the overall probability is:[ frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k left(1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}}right)}{67} ]But this is complicated because it depends on ( m ). However, the problem asks for the probability in terms of ( m ), so perhaps we can leave it in this form.But let me see if there's a way to simplify this expression.Note that ( frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ) is the probability that none of the ( m ) holidays are in the ( k ) stages of the sequence.Therefore, the probability that at least one holiday is in the sequence is ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ).Therefore, the overall probability is the average of this over all sequences, weighted by the number of sequences for each ( k ).But perhaps we can express this as:[ frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k left(1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}}right)}{67} ]Which simplifies to:[ 1 - frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}}}{67} ]But this is still complicated. Maybe we can compute the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m} ).But let's note that ( N_k ) is the number of sequences with ( k ) stages, which is equal to the number of possible ( d ) for each ( k ), which we've already computed.Alternatively, perhaps we can find a generating function or some combinatorial identity to simplify this sum.But this might be too involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m} ) is equal to the number of ways to choose ( m ) stages such that none are in any of the sequences, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps we can think of it as the expected value of ( binom{21 - k}{m} ) over all sequences, weighted by ( N_k ).But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to leave the answer in terms of the sum.But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about it differently.The total number of possible sequences is 67. Each sequence has a certain number of stages ( k ), and for each sequence, the probability that it includes at least one holiday is ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ).Therefore, the overall probability is:[ frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k left(1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}}right)}{67} ]But this is the most precise answer we can give without knowing ( m ).Alternatively, perhaps we can express it as:[ 1 - frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m}}{67 cdot binom{21}{m}} ]But this is still in terms of ( m ).Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m} ) for each ( m ), but without knowing ( m ), it's difficult.Wait, but the problem says \\"the holidays are independently and uniformly distributed among the 21 stages\\", so perhaps it's with replacement, meaning that each holiday is assigned independently to a stage, so the probability that a particular stage is not a holiday is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^m ), and the probability that all ( k ) stages are not holidays is ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{m cdot k} ).But as we saw earlier, this model leads to inconsistencies when ( k=21 ), because the probability that none are holidays would be ( left(frac{20}{21}right)^{21m} ), which is not zero, but in reality, if all stages are in the sequence, then all holidays must be in the sequence, so the probability should be 1.Therefore, this suggests that the correct model is without replacement, i.e., the holidays are assigned to distinct stages.Therefore, the probability that a particular sequence of ( k ) stages contains at least one holiday is ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ).Therefore, the overall probability is:[ frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k left(1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}}right)}{67} ]But since the problem asks for the probability in terms of ( m ), we can leave it in this form.Alternatively, perhaps we can express it as:[ 1 - frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m}}{67 cdot binom{21}{m}} ]But I think this is as simplified as it gets.However, perhaps we can compute the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m} ).Let me note that ( N_k ) is the number of sequences with ( k ) stages, which is equal to the number of possible ( d ) for each ( k ), which we've already computed.But perhaps we can find a generating function for ( N_k ).Alternatively, perhaps we can note that ( N_k ) is equal to the number of divisors of numbers up to 20, but I'm not sure.Alternatively, perhaps we can note that ( N_k ) is equal to the number of integers ( d ) such that ( d leq frac{20}{k - 1} ), which is ( leftlfloor frac{20}{k - 1} rightrfloor ).But I'm not sure if that helps.Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m} ) for each ( m ), but without knowing ( m ), it's difficult.Wait, but the problem says \\"the probability that a randomly chosen arithmetic sequence... includes at least one national holiday\\". So perhaps the answer is simply ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ), but averaged over all sequences.But since the sequences have different ( k ), we need to average over all ( k ) weighted by ( N_k ).Therefore, the final answer is:[ boxed{1 - frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m}}{67 cdot binom{21}{m}}} ]But I'm not sure if this is the expected form. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply ( 1 - left(frac{21 - m}{21}right)^k ), but averaged over ( k ).Wait, no, because ( k ) varies.Alternatively, perhaps the answer is ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ), but since ( k ) varies, it's not a single value.Wait, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again.If the holidays are assigned uniformly at random, the probability that a particular stage is a holiday is ( frac{m}{21} ). The probability that a particular sequence of ( k ) stages includes at least one holiday is ( 1 - left(1 - frac{m}{21}right)^k ), assuming independence, which is not exactly correct because the holidays are assigned without replacement.But if we assume independence, which is not strictly true, but perhaps for the sake of the problem, we can use this approximation.Therefore, the probability that a sequence of ( k ) stages includes at least one holiday is ( 1 - left(1 - frac{m}{21}right)^k ).Then, the overall probability is the average of this over all sequences, weighted by ( N_k ).Therefore, the overall probability is:[ frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k left(1 - left(1 - frac{m}{21}right)^kright)}{67} ]But this is an approximation.Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects this answer.But given that the problem specifies that the holidays are assigned without replacement, the correct probability is ( 1 - frac{binom{21 - k}{m}}{binom{21}{m}} ), and the overall probability is the average over all sequences.But since the problem doesn't specify whether the holidays are assigned with or without replacement, and given that national holidays are distinct, I think the correct model is without replacement.Therefore, the answer is:[ boxed{1 - frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m}}{67 cdot binom{21}{m}}} ]But I'm not sure if this is the expected form. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.Wait, perhaps we can think of it as follows:The total number of possible sequences is 67. The total number of ways to choose ( m ) holidays is ( binom{21}{m} ).The number of sequences that include at least one holiday is the total number of sequences minus the number of sequences that include no holidays.The number of sequences that include no holidays is the sum over ( k=1 ) to 21 of ( N_k cdot binom{21 - k}{m} ), but only if ( 21 - k geq m ). Otherwise, it's zero.Wait, no, that's not correct. The number of sequences that include no holidays is the sum over ( k=1 ) to 21 of ( N_k cdot binom{21 - k}{m} ) divided by ( binom{21}{m} ), but I'm getting confused.Alternatively, perhaps the number of sequences that include no holidays is the sum over ( k=1 ) to 21 of ( N_k cdot binom{21 - k}{m} ), but this is not correct because each sequence is a set of ( k ) stages, and the number of ways to choose ( m ) holidays that are not in the sequence is ( binom{21 - k}{m} ).Therefore, the total number of pairs (sequence, holiday set) where the sequence includes no holidays is ( sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k cdot binom{21 - k}{m} ).Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen sequence includes at least one holiday is:[ 1 - frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k cdot binom{21 - k}{m}}{67 cdot binom{21}{m}} ]Which is the same as before.Therefore, the final answer is:[ boxed{1 - frac{sum_{k=1}^{21} N_k binom{21 - k}{m}}{67 cdot binom{21}{m}}} ]But I'm not sure if this is the expected form. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as considering the probability for each stage being in the sequence and then using inclusion-exclusion.But given the time I've spent, I think this is the most accurate answer I can come up with."},{"question":"Mr. Smith is a successful business owner who runs a chain of coffee shops.

She found that in 1980, there were 250 computers in schools. By 1990, this number had increased to 1,000 computers. In her study, she predicts that the number of computers will continue to grow at the same rate over each subsequent decade. How many computers does Dr. Smith predict will be in schools by the year 2010 if the trend continues?","answer":"First, I need to determine the growth rate of computers in schools from 1980 to 1990. In 1980, there were 250 computers, and by 1990, this number increased to 1,000 computers. To find the growth rate, I'll calculate the increase in the number of computers over the decade and then divide by the initial number. The increase is 1,000 minus 250, which equals 750 computers. Dividing this by the initial number of 250 gives a growth rate of 3, or 300%.Next, I'll apply this growth rate to each subsequent decade. Starting with 1,000 computers in 1990, applying a 300% growth rate for the 1990s would result in 4,000 computers by 2000.

There are 5 classrooms, each with 20 students, so that's 5 multiplied by 20, which equals 100 students in total.Next, I'll calculate the number of students who are not meeting the dress code standards. In each classroom, 4 students are not compliant, and there are 5 classrooms. So, 4 multiplied by 5 equals 20 students who are not following the dress code.Now, I'll find out how many students are compliant by subtracting the non-compliant students from the total number of students. That's 100 total students minus 20 non-compliant students, which equals 80 compliant students.Finally, to determine the total number of tokens distributed, I'll multiply the number of compliant students by the number of tokens each receives. Each compliant student gets 2 tokens, so 80 multiplied by 2 equals 160 tokens in total."},{"question":"Mr. Gupta, an Indian history teacher who specializes in surname etymology, is creating a timeline for his students to understand the origins of various Indian surnames. He starts with 30 surnames that have their origins traced back to the ancient Gupta Empire. He then discovers that 15 more surnames are linked to the Maurya Empire and adds them to his list. Later, he finds that 10 of these surnames are common to both the Gupta and Maurya Empires. To make the research easier, he categorizes the surnames into 5 different regional groups. How many surnames does each group have if they are evenly distributed?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of unique surnames Mr. Gupta has identified. He initially has 30 surnames from the Gupta Empire and adds 15 more from the Maurya Empire, making a total of 45 surnames. However, 10 of these surnames are common to both empires, so I should subtract these duplicates to avoid double-counting. This gives me 35 unique surnames.Next, Mr. Gupta wants to distribute these 35 unique surnames evenly across 5 regional groups. To find out how many surnames each group will have, I divide the total number of unique surnames by the number of groups. Dividing 35 by 5 results in 7 surnames per group.Therefore, each regional group will have 7 surnames."},{"question":"Alex is a patient who believes in natural healing and often refuses medical treatments.

One day, Alex is asked to decide how best to allocate a budget for a team project. Alex starts by collecting data from three departments: Marketing, Development, and Sales.- Marketing requests 1,200,- Development requests 1,800, and- Sales requests 1,000.After analyzing the requests, Alex learns that the Development department has already received 300 from another source, and Marketing has agreed to reduce their request by 200 if necessary. With a total budget of 3,000 to work with, how much will Alex allocate to each department, ensuring that the total does not exceed the budget?","answer":"First, I'll list the initial requests from each department: Marketing asks for 1,200, Development requests 1,800, and Sales needs 1,000.Next, I'll consider the additional information provided. Development has already received 300 from another source, so their remaining need is 1,800 minus 300, which equals 1,500. Marketing has agreed to reduce their request by 200 if necessary, so their adjusted request is 1,200 minus 200, totaling 1,000.Now, I'll sum up the adjusted requests: Marketing at 1,000, Development at 1,500, and Sales at 1,000, which adds up to 3,500. However, the total budget available is 3,000, so there's a 500 shortfall.To address this shortfall, I'll look for areas where additional reductions can be made. Since Marketing has already reduced their request by 200, I can consider further reducing their allocation by 500 to cover the shortfall. This would bring Marketing's allocation down to 500.Finally, I'll distribute the budget accordingly: Marketing receives 500, Development gets 1,500, and Sales is allocated 1,000.

How many trays in total does the activist need to order for the event?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many groups of four people will be formed. Each group consists of one child, two parents, and one grandparent.There are 40 children, and since each group requires one child, there will be 40 groups in total.Next, I check if there are enough parents and grandparents for these groups. Each group needs two parents, so 40 groups will require 80 parents. However, there are only 30 parents available, which is insufficient.To ensure that each group has two parents, the number of groups must be limited by the number of parents. With 30 parents, the maximum number of groups is 15 (since each group needs two parents: 30 ÷ 2 = 15).Now, I check the number of grandparents. Each group requires one grandparent, so 15 groups will need 15 grandparents. There are 20 grandparents available, which is more than enough.Finally, the activist orders 5 extra trays as a reserve.

Again, I'll convert the percentage to a decimal and perform the multiplication.Then, for Bangladesh, the increase is 1.2% of 165 million. I'll follow the same process of converting the percentage and multiplying by the population.After calculating the individual increases, I'll add them all together to find the total population increase for the three countries combined."},{"question":"Mr. Johnson is a seasoned real estate investor who specializes in rental properties for students. He owns three apartment buildings near a university. The first building has 12 units, the second has 8 units, and the third has 15 units. All the units are fully rented out to students. If Mr. Johnson charges 600 per month for each unit in the first building, 750 per month for each unit in the second building, and 650 per month for each unit in the third building, how much total rental income does Mr. Johnson earn in a month from all three buildings?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the monthly rental income for each of the three apartment buildings separately.For the first building, there are 12 units rented at 600 each. So, the income from the first building is 12 multiplied by 600, which equals 7,200.Next, the second building has 8 units rented at 750 each. The income from the second building is 8 multiplied by 750, totaling 6,000.Then, the third building has 15 units rented at 650 each. The income from the third building is 15 multiplied by 650, amounting to 9,750.Finally, to find the total monthly rental income from all three buildings, I add up the incomes from each building: 7,200 plus 6,000 plus 9,750, which equals 22,950."},{"question":"Emily was inspired by a powerful photo series about children waiting for adoption. In the series, there were 5 photos, each featuring a group of children. In the first photo, there were 4 children. In the second photo, there were twice as many children as in the first photo. The third photo had 3 more children than the second photo. The fourth photo had half the number of children as in the third photo. Finally, the fifth photo had the same number of children as the fourth photo. How many children were featured in total across all five photos?","answer":"First, I identify the number of children in each photo based on the given information.In the first photo, there are 4 children.The second photo has twice as many children as the first, so that's 4 multiplied by 2, which equals 8 children.The third photo has 3 more children than the second photo. Adding 3 to 8 gives 11 children.The fourth photo has half the number of children as the third photo. Half of 11 is 5.5, but since we can't have half a child, I'll assume it's 5 or 6 children. For the sake of this calculation, I'll use 5.5.The fifth photo has the same number of children as the fourth photo, so that's also 5.5 children.Finally, I sum up the number of children in all five photos to find the total number of children featured."},{"question":"Alex, a human resources manager, is preparing an onboarding session for new employees to help them understand their insurance benefits. The company offers a health insurance plan where the premium is shared between the company and the employee. The total monthly premium is 600. The company pays 70% of this premium, and the employee is responsible for the remaining amount. Additionally, during the onboarding process, Alex explains that the company also offers a dental insurance plan where the company pays 15 per month, and the employee pays 10 per month.If a new employee decides to enroll in both the health and dental insurance plans, how much will the employee pay each month for their insurance benefits?","answer":"First, I need to determine the employee's monthly contribution to the health insurance plan. The total monthly premium for health insurance is 600, and the company covers 70% of this amount. Calculating 70% of 600 gives me 420, which is the company's share. Subtracting this from the total premium, the employee's share for health insurance is 180 per month.Next, for the dental insurance plan, the company pays 15 per month, and the employee is responsible for 10 per month.To find the total monthly payment for both plans, I add the employee's share of the health insurance (180) to their share of the dental insurance (10), resulting in a total of 190 per month."},{"question":"Mrs. Thompson, a retired art teacher living in the Denver area, decided to host a small art class in her home for local children. She plans to teach a total of 5 sessions, and each session will include 8 students. For each session, she needs 3 paintbrushes, 2 canvases, and 4 tubes of paint per student.Mrs. Thompson went to the art supply store and found that a pack of 10 paintbrushes costs 15, a pack of 5 canvases costs 20, and a set of 10 tubes of paint costs 25.How much will Mrs. Thompson spend in total on supplies for all 5 sessions?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of each supply Mrs. Thompson will need for all 5 sessions.For paintbrushes, each session requires 3 per student, and there are 8 students. So, for one session, she needs 3 * 8 = 24 paintbrushes. Over 5 sessions, that's 24 * 5 = 120 paintbrushes.Next, for canvases, each session requires 2 per student. That means 2 * 8 = 16 canvases per session. Over 5 sessions, she needs 16 * 5 = 80 canvases.For tubes of paint, each session requires 4 per student. So, 4 * 8 = 32 tubes per session. Over 5 sessions, that's 32 * 5 = 160 tubes of paint.Now, I'll calculate how many packs of each supply she needs to purchase.For paintbrushes, each pack contains 10. She needs 120, so she needs 120 / 10 = 12 packs.For canvases, each pack contains 5. She needs 80, so she needs 80 / 5 = 16 packs.For tubes of paint, each set contains 10. She needs 160, so she needs 160 / 10 = 16 sets.Finally, I'll calculate the total cost for each supply and sum them up.Paintbrushes cost 15 per pack, so 12 packs cost 12 * 15 = 180.Canvases cost 20 per pack, so 16 packs cost 16 * 20 = 320.Tubes of paint cost 25 per set, so 16 sets cost 16 * 25 = 400.Adding these together: 180 + 320 + 400 = 900.Therefore, Mrs. Thompson will spend a total of 900 on supplies for all 5 sessions."},{"question":"Maria owns a restaurant near the city's new subway station, which has increased foot traffic to her area. Before the subway station opened, Maria's restaurant had an average of 50 customers per day. After the station opened, the number of daily customers increased by 60%. One Saturday, Maria decides to offer a special discount to attract even more customers. This discount brings in an additional 30 customers that day. How many customers does Maria have on that Saturday after the subway station opened and with the special discount?","answer":"First, I need to determine the increase in customers after the subway station opened. Maria's restaurant had an average of 50 customers per day before the subway. With a 60% increase, the number of additional customers is 0.60 multiplied by 50, which equals 30 customers. This means the new average number of customers after the subway opened is 50 plus 30, totaling 80 customers per day.Next, on the Saturday when Maria offers a special discount, she attracts an additional 30 customers. To find the total number of customers that day, I add the 30 extra customers to the new average of 80 customers. This results in a total of 110 customers on that Saturday."},{"question":"Emily's old water heater cost 1.20 a day in gas. She recently replaced it with a new energy-efficient model that costs 0.80 a day in gas. How much money does Emily save in a 60-day billing cycle with her new water heater?","answer":"First, I need to determine the daily gas cost for both the old and new water heaters. The old water heater costs 1.20 per day, while the new one costs 0.80 per day.Next, I'll calculate the daily savings by subtracting the new cost from the old cost: 1.20 - 0.80 = 0.40 saved each day.Finally, to find the total savings over a 60-day billing cycle, I'll multiply the daily savings by 60: 0.40 * 60 = 24.00."},{"question":"Alex is an expatriate living in Berlin and is trying to find an electrician who can speak English. There are 12 electricians listed in the local directory. Out of these, 7 can speak English. Alex calls 3 electricians who do not speak English before finding the first one who does. If Alex continues calling the electricians at random, how many more electricians who can speak English does Alex need to call to have spoken with all the English-speaking electricians in the directory?","answer":"First, I need to understand the problem. There are 12 electricians in total, and out of these, 7 can speak English. Alex has already called 3 electricians who do not speak English and found the first one who does. So, there are 12 - 3 - 1 = 8 electricians remaining.Out of the remaining 8 electricians, 7 - 1 = 6 can speak English. Since Alex has already spoken with one English-speaking electrician, there are 6 more English-speaking electricians left to contact.To determine how many more electricians Alex needs to call to speak with all the English-speaking ones, I can use the concept of expectation. The expected number of calls needed to find one English-speaking electrician is the total number of remaining electricians divided by the number of English-speaking electricians remaining. So, the expected number of calls is 8 / 6 ≈ 1.333.Since Alex needs to speak with all 6 remaining English-speaking electricians, the total expected number of additional calls is 6 * 1.333 ≈ 8.0.Therefore, Alex needs to make approximately 8 more calls to have spoken with all the English-speaking electricians in the directory."},{"question":"Arjun, a politically unattached Gujarati-speaking individual, is attending a cultural fair in his town.

Instead, he spends time at the food stalls enjoying traditional Gujarati snacks. He buys 3 dhoklas for ₹15 each, 2 plates of khandvi for ₹20 each, and 4 fafda for ₹10 each. While enjoying his snacks, he notices a booth offering a discount on traditional Gujarati sweets due to a festival. The discount is 10% on a box of sweets that originally costs ₹200. Calculate the total amount Arjun spends on the snacks and the box of sweets after the discount.","answer":"First, I'll calculate the cost of each type of snack Arjun buys. He buys 3 dhoklas at ₹15 each, which totals ₹45. Next, he purchases 2 plates of khandvi at ₹20 each, amounting to ₹40. Then, he buys 4 fafda at ₹10 each, totaling ₹40.Adding these amounts together, the total cost for the snacks is ₹45 + ₹40 + ₹40 = ₹125.Arjun also decides to buy a box of sweets originally priced at ₹200 with a 10% discount. The discount amount is 10% of ₹200, which is ₹20. Therefore, the discounted price of the sweets is ₹200 - ₹20 = ₹180.Finally, to find the total amount Arjun spends, I'll add the cost of the snacks and the discounted sweets: ₹125 + ₹180 = ₹305."},{"question":"A renowned guest speaker is invited to give a talk at a conference. The secretary, known for their attention to detail and professionalism, sends out invitations to 150 attendees. Each attendee is expected to bring one guest. The speaker appreciates the secretary's efforts and decides to distribute signed bookmarks to all attendees and their guests. If the speaker signs 3 bookmarks per minute, how many hours will it take for the speaker to sign bookmarks for all the attendees and their guests?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total number of people who will receive signed bookmarks. There are 150 attendees, and each attendee is bringing one guest. So, the total number of people is 150 attendees plus 150 guests, which equals 300 people.Next, the speaker signs 3 bookmarks per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take to sign all 300 bookmarks, I divide the total number of bookmarks by the signing rate: 300 bookmarks divided by 3 bookmarks per minute equals 100 minutes.Finally, to convert the signing time from minutes to hours, I divide the total minutes by 60. So, 100 minutes divided by 60 equals approximately 1.67 hours."},{"question":"During a crisis situation, an emergency response coordinator needs to provide psychological support to affected individuals. The coordinator works with a psychologist to set up support centers. Each center can accommodate 25 people and requires 1 hour of the psychologist's time for every 5 people.If there are 200 people in need of psychological support and the psychologist has 12 hours available, how many centers can the coordinator set up to ensure all the people receive the support they need?","answer":"First, I need to determine how many people can be supported given the psychologist's available time. The psychologist has 12 hours and spends 1 hour for every 5 people. So, 12 hours multiplied by 5 people per hour equals 60 people that can be supported.Next, I'll calculate how many support centers are needed to accommodate all 200 people. Each center can hold 25 people. Dividing 200 by 25 gives 8 centers required.However, the psychologist can only support 60 people in the available time. This means that only 60 people can receive support, which is less than the total number of people in need. Therefore, the coordinator can only set up enough centers to support 60 people, which is 3 centers (since 60 divided by 25 is 2.4, and we need to round up to the next whole number).In conclusion, the coordinator can set up 3 support centers to ensure that the available psychologist time is fully utilized while providing support to as many people as possible."},{"question":"Principal Johnson is organizing a special event for the middle school students at Grace Christian Academy.
